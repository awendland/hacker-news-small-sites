      We need to talk.
    </p><div>

<p>Here’s a paraphrased conversation I’m having way to often, costing me way too much time, keeping me from doing things that are way more important:</p>

<pre>User: Hi, I'd like to report a bug in your application.
Me:   Great! Please open a support ticket, then.
User: But, it looks like I need to pay for that?
Me:   So?
User: I just want to tell you that your app is broken, so you can fix it.
Me:   Yes, that's a support request, please open a ticket.
User: ...
</pre>

  </a>
  
</figure><p>
                             
                             
From there it typically derails into a whiny tirade about me being a crappy two bit developer who doesn’t give a shit about his code (which is ridiculous, since, professional pride aside, I have every incentive to fix bugs, to prevent my inbox from getting flooded) and just wants to rip off his users.</p>

<p>In the past, I sometimes gave in (when it sounded like something might be wrong). I looked at the issue and almost always found that nothing was broken, just didn’t work as expected (which is actually to be expected for every reasonably complex piece of software). The user just didn’t bother reading the docs and tried to bypass the fee by masquerading the support request as a bug report. So, nowadays my policy simply is: no support ticket, no service. Any such request goes straight to the trash folder without even being looked at.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-such-an-asshole">Why am I such an asshole?</h2>

<p>Here’s the thing: I write open source software to solve <strong>my problem</strong>. I let you use my solutions because that comes at zero cost for me (well, almost, I still have to pay for the website, you are downloading from. You are welcome, by the way). I also provide the source code, so you can fix things yourself, should my solution turn out to be unsuitable. However, once you come to me with a “bugreport” that doesn’t also include a patch (or at least very precisely pinpoints the problem), then you are basically asking me to <strong>look at your problem</strong>. At this point, it is no longer zero cost for me and that’s the reason for why I am charging you money: you are asking me to spent time on your behalf. That is commonly called <strong>work</strong>. And surprisingly enough, work is what people expect to be paid for.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m happy to help. Selling support is what keeps the lights on here (did I mention the cost of running a webserver?). But coming to me under false pretense and/or expecting that I <strong>must</strong> provide free service on top of a software I gave away without charge is not going to win you any favours.</p>

<p>It stops being free, when it starts costing me! My time is valuable. If you want a piece of it, I want money in return. Period.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems like this post has struck a nerve and caused a few misunderstandings. <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/reactions-bugreport-free-support/">Clarification on my position here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[Lazy Loading Explained]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>Lazy loading is a very cool design pattern that is not often talked about. Many frameworks implement it without even telling us about it ðŸ˜Š. For example, .NET Entity Framework (all versions) support the pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what is lazy loading? The idea behind the pattern is simple. By using lazy loading, we defer the initialization of objects (heavy ones) until we need them. Thatâ€™s it.</p>



<p>Letâ€™s provide an example. We have a simple HR application. The application supports the tracking of employee records. Each record has standard fields like name, email, date of birth, and image (like a profile picture), etc.</p>



<p>The application has operations like adding employees, updating employees, searching for an employee, generating reports, etc. Do all functions need the image of the employee? Should we load images in some aggregated reports? Of course not. A picture can take a lot of resources, so it is not reasonable to load it everywhere. And here, lazy loading comes to help us.</p>



<h2>Lazy loading implementation</h2>



<p>There are several ways to implement the lazy loading pattern, but we are going to inspect the most used one (when it comes to manual implementation).</p>



<p>In the source code, the employee domain model is represented like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ALL THE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>Nothing special. Just a class with three fields and a method which would load all the data. But as we said, most of the time, we do not want the Image data because it could take a lot of resources.</p>



<p>So, how do we <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/02/15/what-is-code-refactoring/">refactor</a> the class? We do It like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> image<span>;</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>get</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>if</span> <span>(</span>image <span>==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image <span>=</span> LoadImage<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>else</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>set</span> <span>{</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image <span>=</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ONLY NAME AND EMAIL PROPERTIES.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> LoadImage<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING AND RETURNING IMAGE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>We followed only four steps:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Extract the logic for image data load from the Load method to a new Method â€“ LoadImage;</li><li>Introduce a new private field for the image data;</li><li>Refactor the Image property to check if image data is null. If it is, the new method loads the image data, assigns it to the image field, and then return it to the consumer.</li></ol>



<p>Next time we load the object (or objects if we load a collection of them), we wonâ€™t have the overhead of loading unnecessary image data. We are going to extract the image data only when we need it (by accessing Image property).</p>



<h2><strong>ORMs</strong></h2>



<p>ORMs like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entity Framework Core</a> support lazy loading. When a query is executed, not all the properties are loaded (unless you have disabled lazy loading). Only by accessing them, another query runs to fetch the data.</p>



<p>For example, imagine we have two entities in relation: a Company entity and an Employee entity. A company has many employees. If we query for a specific company by id and we get a result, the list of its employees wonâ€™t be loaded. Only when we access them a new query will fetch the collection.</p>



<p>In some cases, this is cool in others, not ðŸ˜Š.</p>



<p>Can we implement our own lazy loading if we are using some ORM? Sure. The thing you should do is not to map properties/entities that donâ€™t need to be loaded with every query. Of course, you should provide proper methods to handle the data that is not loaded.</p>



<p>In Entity Framework, you use the [NotMapped] attribute to annotate desired properties.</p>



<p>You can read in many places that lazy loading is used when accessing network resources. That is true but not complete. You can use lazy loading also for any demanding operation, like complex computations, reading big chunks of local data, etc.</p>

<p>This is a tiny lesson in design I learned at Freshworks. The lesson seems obvious in hindsight, but it wasn’t so obvious when we were making the mistake.</p>



<p>So, <a href="http://www.freshdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Freshdesk</a> is used by customer support teams day in and day out. When these teams log in to Freshdesk, we show them conversations their users had sent in over email, Twitter, Facebook, etc – in one place. &nbsp;</p>



<p>These customer support teams can pick between two different views to see these conversations when reading them on Freshdesk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One view was called the <strong>card view</strong>. The card view is quite similar to how emails appear today in mobile Gmail. It was the default, and it looked like this:</p>

<p>When we got on calls with teams that used Freshdesk, we were surprised that they hadn’t discovered table view until we told them about it.</p>



<p>A person actually told us that the icon we had used to represent the table view was too small, and it appeared like a calculator and not actually a table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first time I heard it – I’ll be honest, I chuckled. Then, I went back and thought about it and felt he was totally right. We had all sorts of icons (with <strong>no</strong> supplemental text) that made no sense to our customers. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>That’s</strong>&nbsp;<strong>when I learned a design lesson that I carry in my heart till day.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone’s muscle memory recognises the icons for ‘Save’, ‘Delete’ and ‘New’ as ‘something that looks like a floppy’, ‘a bin’ or ‘a plus’, respectively. And they know what these icons convey in the apps they’re seeing them on.</p>



<p>But the products we’re building these days have more than just these universally recognized actions. Brand new icons you may be using to represent these actions aren’t part of anyone’s muscle memory (like the floppy or bin icons).&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your product has a button to let sales people change the deal stage, it cannot be just an icon. It’s got to be supplemented with text. </p>



<p>If you’re building a feature where you’re taking people to a ‘focus mode’ to do some intense work using a button, you can’t have just an icon to represent it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sure, your designers and product team might love having just icons to represent these actions to save space but your users will:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. end up rarely noticing the icon if it’s not a frequent action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. when it’s a frequent action, they’ll click on the icon,&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. realise they clicked on the wrong one,</p>



<p>4. then go on a trip to find what they actually want to click on,</p>



<p>5. then click on the right one after some retries.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>It just doesn’t work when someone says “we can just use an icon and get rid of the text to save some space in the screen.”</strong> By doing that, you’re not saving space – you’re actually causing a usability problem that your customer base will run into hundreds or thousands of times a day.</p>



<p><strong>So, here’s the bottomline:</strong></p>



<p>More often than not, content eats icons for breakfast. Any action that’s <strong>not universal</strong> like ‘save’, ‘new’ or ‘delete’ <strong>must include text.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>By doing this, you actually eliminate the thinking required by your users every time they’re trying to click on that button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have 1000 users, and on average, if one user does an action that’s represented by only an icon 10 times a day, that’s 10,000 confused and unsure clicks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ten thousand literal moments everyday when people are spending a few seconds to figure out if they’re clicking on the right button or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminate those 10k*2 seconds = 5 hours by just adding relevant text to those icons 🙂</p>



<p><strong>You’re not just saving those 10 seconds, you’re saving customers from feeling stupid, which they should never feel when using your products anyway 🙂</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I don't expect to have an ARM-based PC any time soon</h2>

	<p><small>November 15, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The ARM-related news of the time interval is of course that Apple
has announced several ARM-based Mac laptops and that early (and
preliminary) leaks are that they perform very well and are definitely
competitive. This raises the great hope in many technical people's
minds of ARM based laptops and desktops from more than Apple, ARM
PCs that would run more than Apple's OS X. This is especially a
dream for many Unix people, who already run little or no commercial
binary software and so in theory ARM support is only a recompile
away; moving away from the x86 hegemony would please a lot of people.</p>

<p>(The practice of moving to ARM is somewhat different, especially
for performance sensitive code. Focused use of x86 assembly is
surprisingly common in various places.)</p>

<p>My own view is that while I wouldn't mind using a competitive ARM
based PC (either laptop or desktop), I don't expect to actually
have one any time soon. The rub is that 'competitive'. Right now,
the only ARM chip maker that can compete with the performance of
the x86 hegemony in the desktop/laptop space is Apple, and Apple's
machines only run OS X. While there are promising developments in
the server space, many of them are also bespoke to the large cloud
vendors, and also may not be particularly suitable for scaling down
to desktops and laptops (in all sorts of dimensions, including how
much money can be made on them).</p>

<p>Apple has demonstrated that it's possible to make ARM be competitive
(on laptops, at least, although likely on desktops too), but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1326317293849153540">they
stand alone</a>
and I don't think it's likely for anyone else to join them. Apple has
the benefit of a gigantic market for their own ARM designs that
feeds a firehose of money into their R&amp;D budget and also good
assurance of large production runs even for laptop CPUs (never mind
phone ones). Anyone else would be in the position of trying to take
laptop and desktop CPU market share from Intel and AMD (who are
already fighting each other), without the kind of money firehose
and good market that Apple has.</p>

<p>(Apple also has the benefit of capturing all of the profit from its
laptops. An ARM CPU maker would capture much less of the profit of
machines with its CPUs in them; much of the overall profit would go
to the system vendors or at least to the makers of other parts, like
motherboards.)</p>

<p>The other problem is that merely being competitive isn't good enough,
because there are real costs to switching to ARM (even for Unix
people). It's likely that an ARM PC would need to be clearly better
than the x86 equivalent before very many people became interested,
and might face an extended period of doubt and proving itself. To
be honest, that would be my attitude toward the first generation
of ARM PCs; I would not buy immediately and let other people get
those experiences.</p>

<p>(I think this will be easier on laptops than on desktops, because
on laptops power efficiency can count for a lot. The longer battery
lifetime is already one of Apple's selling points for their new ARM
laptops)</p>

<p>PS: I would love to be wrong on this, as I'm not particularly fond
of the x86 hegemony. But I'm also a pragmatist.</p>

    <p>You’re happily working your way through a codebase when you happen upon some code that makes you stop and think: What the…!? Maybe it’s a method that’s doing something surprising. Or perhaps it’s doing something completely unsurprising, it’s just doing it in a surprising way.</p>

<p><img src="https://tekin.co.uk/images/20201113/math-lady.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="git-blame-to-the-rescue">Git blame to the rescue?</h2>

<p>When this happens you might instinctively reach for <code>git blame</code> to help you figure out what’s going on. After all, <code>git blame</code> gives you the commit that most recently touched the line, and often that’s enough to point you in the right direction. But often it isn’t and you’re none the wiser. That’s because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>git blame is too coarse</strong>: it reports against the whole line. If the most recent change isn’t related to the part of the line you’re interested, you’re out of luck.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too shallow</strong>: it only reports a single change; the most recent one. The story of the particular piece of code you’re interested in may have evolved over several commits.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too narrow</strong>: it only considers the file you are running blame against. The code you are interested in may also appear in other files, but to get the relevant commits on those you’ll need to run blame several times.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you only use <code>git blame</code> you’re limiting yourself to a one-dimensional perspective of the code you’re trying to understand. Wouldn’t it be better to view things in 3D!?</p>

<p>Thankfully Git has some pretty powerful search tools built right in. Let’s take a closer look at some of the tools at our disposal.</p>

<p>If <code>git blame</code> is entry-level history search, <code>git log -S</code> (also known as “the pickaxe”) is how you take things to the next level. It lets you search for all commits that contain a given string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git log <span>-S</span> <span>"method_name"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will return all the commits that contain <code>method_name</code> across the entire repository, giving you a bespoke history of a piece of code across both multiple commits and files. You can use the pickaxe to examine the entire history of a particular snippet: all the places it’s been used; how it’s usage has changed; if it’s moved file; when it was first introduced, and more.</p>

<h2 id="see-the-diffs-alongside-the-commit-messages">See the diffs alongside the commit messages</h2>

<p>If you include the <code>-p</code> option (short for <code>--patch</code>) you get the full diff alongside the commit messages, giving you even more context and making it easier to spot the relevant changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-the-commit-that-first-added-some-code">Find the commit that first added some code</h2>

<p>Say you want to find the first commit that introduced a particular class, method or snippet of code. You can use the pickaxe combined with the <code>--reverse</code> option to get the commits in reverse-chronological order so the commit where the code first appears is listed at the top:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p --reverse
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-when-a-piece-of-code-was-deleted">Find when a piece of code was deleted</h2>

<p>Because the pickaxe search finds both additions and deletions, you can even use it to find code that has since been deleted:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "deleted code" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assuming the snippet no longer exists in the codebase the first commit returned will be the one where it was removed.</p>

<h2 id="limit-the-scope-of-the-search">Limit the scope of the search</h2>

<p>Because we’re using <code>git log</code> you can also provide a path to focus the search to a given file or folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "some code" -p app/models/user.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="search-deeper-with-a-regular-expression">Search deeper with a regular expression</h2>

<p>I mostly stick to the pickaxe because I find working with regular expressions cumbersome, but if you want to perform a more advanced search using a regular expression you can do so with <code>-G</code> instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -G "REGEX HERE"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s also worth noting that searching with <code>-S</code> has a subtle limitation that <code>-G</code> does not: <code>-S</code> only shows commits that either added or removed the search string. If the string you are searching for moved within the same file but was otherwise unchanged, <code>-S</code> won’t include that commit, whereas <code>-G</code> will.</p>

<h2 id="search-the-commit-messages-themselves">Search the commit messages themselves</h2>

<p>Sometimes searching for literal code is too narrow, or the information you’re after isn’t actually in the code but in the commit messages themselves. In which case you can use <code>--grep</code> to search commit messages instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log --grep "commit message search"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>

<p>Next time some code has you puzzled and you want to understand more about it, look beyond <code>git blame</code> and dig deeper into the history using the pickaxe and friends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the entire history of a snippet of code with <code>git log -S</code></li>
  <li>Include <code>-p</code> to see the diff as well as the commit messages</li>
  <li>Include <code>--reverse</code> to see the commit that introduced the code listed first</li>
  <li>Scope search to specific folders or files by including a path</li>
  <li>Search with a regular expression using <code>git log -G</code></li>
  <li>Search commit messages using <code>git log --grep</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>Of course searching a codebase’s history will only be fruitful if the history itself is helpful. If the history hasn’t been constructed with atomic commits that have useful commit messages, searching it will likely be a frustrating and unhelpful experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Django framework for building python server applications has been around since forever and I believe that the reason for this is the speed at which you can develop apps without compromising on robustness.<br></p><p>To gauge the usefulness of any backend framework, a great litmus test is to see how easy it is to plug in a database to your application and expose the database models to the client via 4 operations - Create, Read, Update and Delete.<br></p><p>This functionality solves a big chunk of your problems, especially if you are building a product that is more front-end heavy and you want to spend as little bandwidth as possible on building your APIs.<br></p><h3><strong>What is CRUD?</strong><br></h3><p>An application server is nothing but a layer on top of a database which provides the ability for a client application to perform the following underlying operations.<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Create a new entry into a table in the database.</li><li>Read the database table entries either by fetching a list of all entries or retrieving the details of a single entry.</li><li>Update an existing entry in the database either by changing certain details or by replacing it entirely with a new one.</li><li>Delete a database table entry either by removing it from the database or by simply marking it as deleted and deactivating it.<br></li></ol><p>Django has ways of doing all of this right out of the box, but I prefer to use a framework written on top of Django called the <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/" target="_blank">Django Rest Framework</a> which makes things even simpler by providing an intuitive interface to the developers. <br></p><h3><strong>A sample CRUD application</strong><br></h3><div><p>I write all my blog posts on the apple notes app before I edit and publish them and it occurred to me that a note taking app is a great way to <a href="https://github.com/sankalpjonn/django-crud-example" target="_blank">demonstrate a CRUD application</a>. </p></div><figure id="w-node-bc04fc2d279c-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5faf5796ca5e3a5dd77c5b41_XEHsDH39C2XuP7jH2D_R7hv6wYs8ZGIBkCij0NWiAXStAOuzeIqG61JLp52DNELlsmxqfuMj33tIE-0YsgTIIIDeskVcpRMarPKJKsNA4O2rBoMIFmgahW8Vo2J0YCLZqBsym1Mb.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A note taking app that we will build using Django and Django Rest Framework</figcaption></figure><p>To build an application like this, we need a database table that stores a list of notes consisting of a Title, Content and the last updated timestamp. The notes are sorted according to the last updated timestamp.</p><p>To build this application we need the following functions:&nbsp;</p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>Creating a new note with an empty title and content.</li><li>Updating the newly created note with a title and content.</li><li>Reading the fields of a note.</li><li>Partially updating the note by modifying either tile or content.</li><li>Listing all the notes in the database sorted by last updated timestamp.</li><li>Deleting a note by marking it as deactivated.</li></ol><p>I&nbsp;will be going through all the steps involved in creating this application, but first let's start with the basics.</p><h3>Setting up a Django project</h3><p>There is some basic boilerplate code involved in building any Django application. Here is a summary of all the steps needed to set up the boilerplate<br>‍</p><p><em>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/07b99adf85538b5a90a0dcaa34de328c.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><h5><strong>Need for a virtual environment</strong></h5><p>While building any python applications, it is recommended to create a virtual environment and install all the packages you need within this environment to keep them isolated from the rest of your machine. This not only ensures prevention of conflicts but also makes it easy to deploy this application anywhere you want.</p><p>Once this virtual environment is activated, your development environment is setup.</p><h5><strong>Creating a Django project</strong></h5><p>Once the virtual environment is created and the necessary python packages are installed, the boilerplate code you need can be created by using a nifty tool called django-admin. We will use this to create a project called <em>notesapp</em>. This not only creates the project structure but also configures a default SQLite database that you can use for the application. </p><p>This database is nothing but a single file created locally with the name <em>db.sqlite3</em> and is very handy to quickly prototype your application. You can change the database settings inside <em>settings.py</em> to point it to any database. This can be done later too once the basic functionality of your application is ready and works with SQLIte.</p><p>After your Django project is created, you also have to create a new Django app which we will use to define our models and APIs. Let's call this <em>notes. </em>Make sure to add this to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py</p><h3>Creating database models</h3><p>Before writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs, we must first create a database model on which we wish to perform the CRUD&nbsp;operations. Let us create a model called <em>Note </em>in notes/models.py.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/d5e29080d973326be371f0d03a5d23ef.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Before we proceed we must update the schema because a new database table needs to be created in the underlying database. This can be done by creating and running migrations</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE: https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/8234bd9ad41637718be8dca4dba04235.js&lt;/p&gt;<br>‍</p><h3>Creating the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</h3><p>Now that the model has been created, we need a way to perform CRUD operations on this model by writing as little code as possible. This is where Django Rest Framework comes in. Not only can you expose CRUD&nbsp;APIs on this model within minutes, but you also get a pretty nifty user interface to view those APIs in action. </p><p>To do this, you must first define a serializer for the database model you created in the above step. <strong>‍</strong></p><h5><strong>Defining a serializer</strong></h5><p>A serializer is responsible for two things<br></p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>To validate an incoming create/update request and reject it if the fields are not in the format that is required to create/update an entry in the database table.</li><li>To convert a database table entry into a format like JSON&nbsp;that can be transferred over the internet to the client.</li></ol><p>Let us create a serializer in notes/serializers.py as follows.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/4d69bb0c0de94789842fe9eb23e8e882.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Inside the Meta class, we define which database model is being serialized and what all fields within that model should be serialized. We could choose to include only certain fields from the model that we would like to expose over the API.</p><p>We can also define certain fields as <em>read_only</em> which indicates that these fields will be ignored if present in a create/update request but they will be present in the response a read request. </p><p>In this above case, is_active is responsible for indicating if a note has been deleted or not. Therefore we must not allow it to be modified via a create/update request and it should be set to false only when a delete operation is performed. This will become more clear in the upcoming steps. </p><p>We can also define fields as <em>write_only </em>which will indicate that these fields will not be present in a read response but we will allow the field to be modified in a create/update request. We can now proceed to writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</p><h5><strong>Defining an API&nbsp;View set</strong></h5><p>In Django, the APIs are written in views.py and each API&nbsp;that does some operation on a certain database resource is a view. In our case we will be performing multiple operations on the database model and hence what we need is a viewset. Here is how you define one in notes/views.py</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/b313384c0774ec4f1dee342ced8ccc20.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍<br>‍<br>This viewset is now capable of performing all the CRUD&nbsp;operations and it will use the NoteSerializer to determine how the data will be received and how it will be sent back to the requesting client. <br></p><p>Since a read operation could be retrieving a single note or listing all the existing notes, we need a way to handle both cases. </p><p>The <em>get_object </em>is responsible to determine how an object is retrieved. In this case we look for an <em>id </em>field in the query parameters of a a request and use that to retrieve a note. </p><p>This method is also used while making an update operation because to update a particular note we would have to first retrieve that note.</p><p>The <em>get_queryset</em> method is responsible for determining how a list operation will work. In this case we will be listing all the notes which are still active and sort them in the decreasing order of the <em>last_udpated_on</em> timestamp.</p><p>The <em>perform_delete</em> method will determine what to do when a delete operation is requested. In this case we do not want to delete the row from the database and we simply want to deactivate it. Therefore we will be setting the <em>is_active</em> field to False and saving the note.</p><h5>‍<strong>Defining the URL&nbsp;path</strong>‍</h5><p>We just have one more step to complete before we can see our APIs in action and that is to determine what URL&nbsp;path will invoke the above viewset. This can be done in notesapp/urls.py as follows.<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/902b7c23e95e3cb4ddf99f1b52bbbe52.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><div><p>‍</p><p>To explain what is going on here, we are basically saying that if the url <em>/note</em> is called, no matter what the HTTP&nbsp;method is, we will be invoking the NoteViewSet and based on what the HTTP method is we will call a particular method within this viewset.<strong>‍</strong></p></div><ol start="1" role="list"><li>A POST&nbsp;call will result in a create operation of the Note model.</li><li>A GET&nbsp;call will result in retrieving a single Note model object using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A&nbsp;PUT&nbsp;call will result in replacing an existing Note model with a new Note and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A PATCH&nbsp;call will result in modifying only a certain field inside an existing Note model instead of entirely replacing it and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A DELETE&nbsp;call will result in calling a destroy function which internally calls the <em>perform_destroy</em> method defined above in views.py.</li></ol><p>In case you haven't noticed, there is one thing missing in this url PATH and that is the ability to list all the existing Note model objects. </p><p>To solve this I&nbsp;created another URL&nbsp;path <em>/note/all </em>where I am invoking the same viewset as the above one with the difference being the GET&nbsp;call will now invoke a list method on the viewset instead of a retrieve method which means that the <em>get_queryset </em>method defined earlier will be invoked.<br></p><h3>See your APIs in action<br></h3><p>Okay enough talk, let us now run the server and view the APIs in action. You can run the Django development server using the below command and it will expose your server on the 8000 port on localhost.</p><div><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/473d335affb3426f7d5cbc1a747e4fe4.js&lt;/p&gt;</p></div><blockquote>Please do not forget to include <em>r…</em></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4608430843265935994">
<p>I am what I would call a non-famous public person. What do I mean by that? I mean that I have jobs where people publicly review my work. As a college instructor, I receive student reviews. Some of them get read internally at our school, and some of them get posted publicy. And they’re attached to my name. They’re not some product where people might just know my company or my brand. They know <em>me</em>, and they’re reviewing <em>me</em>. As an author, my books get reviewed. Some of those reviews are by editors and official reviewers internal to the publisher. Some of those reviews are by email. But most of those reviews are posted online. As a software developer and hobbyist podcaster I also get public reviews.</p>

<p>To anyone in a personalized creative field who cares deeply about their work, bad reviews hurt. It’s not just about being sensitive (although I am sensitive and that doesn’t help). It’s that when you really pour your heart into something, as I do my teaching for example, then the product is an extension of you. Nobody would deny that the way a class or a book turns out is an extension of the personality, knowledge, and ability of the teacher/author. And when the product is criticized, it’s like you are being criticized. </p>

<p>My dad, who was also a college instructor, and the producer of nine books and nine instructional videos among many other public creative ventures, had a very thin skin. He couldn’t stand me reading him a bad review. That stuck with me. This very accomplished man, couldn’t stand even a little criticism. When I get too sensitive, I try to remember how his inability to accept criticism hurt some of his products. He was much more about getting things done than doing them perfectly. If he had a little bit more of a perfectionist streak in him, he would have done even better. But maybe he would have done less…</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if I receive eighteen great reviews for a class. It’s the words of the two bad reviews that stick with me. And do you know why? <em>Because almost always there’s a kernel of truth to those reviews.</em> Does that mean we should listen to them? Well if I only listened to the bad reviews, I would never produce anything. I would just stay in bed. The fact is the people who are getting no bad reviews, are the people who are not taking the risk of putting themselves out there. So, we have to not let ourselves get so discouraged that we stop producing. And we have to remember that while we may not have served those two students well, we may have served those other eighteen students better than they would have been served in a world without us teaching them. </p>

<p>We can’t please every student or every customer. Nothing that gets watched/read by more than a few people is going to be liked by all of them. Even Mother Theresa would get a downvote on YouTube. So, if we’re serving the majority, we don’t want to let the critiques of a few steer us in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, being like my dad is dangerous too. <strong>No, the customer is not always right. But usually the customer has a point. We have to always be working to get better.</strong> Because we’re not perfect, and there’s always room for improvement. <strong>And we need to read those bad reviews to find those spaces for improvement.</strong> It doesn’t mean they’re right, but it does mean we need to think about them.</p>

<p>My dad accomplished an amazing amount. If he let those bad reviews slow him down too much, it’s very possible he would have not accomplished as much. But if he could have found a few tweaks, a few changes, to serve a few customers better, well then he could have grown through them. I want to grow, but I also don’t want to stop. So, I can’t let the reviews get me too down, but I have to read them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>In this article, let’s learn to compute VMAF, PSNR, and SSIM using FFmpeg. While working on videos (compression or post-processing), it is common to compute objective metrics in addition to doing subjective Visual Quality testing. If you are using FFmpeg in your workflow, it is very easy to compute these metrics instead of purchasing expensive tools. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and take a look at these metrics and how they are computed, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What is VMAF?</h2>



<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VMAF from Netflix</a></strong>&nbsp;stands for Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion, and it is a video quality metric that combines human vision modeling with machine learning. It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p>



<p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. To understand how to install VMAF, please read our “<a href="https://ottverse.com/vmaf-ffmpeg-ubuntu-compilation-installation-usage-guide/">VMAF Installation</a>” article.</p>



<hr>



<h2>How to Compute VMAF using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>Let’s look at a couple of ways of computing VMAF. </p>



<p><strong>If your source and destination videos are of the same dimensions (height and width)</strong>, then you can directly compute the VMAF value using the command line below. </p>



<p>All you need to do is point FFmpeg to the location of the VMAF model file and it will do the rest. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi libvmaf="model_path=vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl":log_path=vmaf_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p><strong>However, in case the source and destination videos are not of the same resolution, then you have to ensure that the destination is brought to the same resolution as the source video before computing VMAF</strong>.</p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that uses the <code>filter_complex</code> to do the resolution change and then computes the VMAF value. I have used the <code>bicubic</code> filter to do the up/down scaling. </p>



<pre><code><code>bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mp4 -i test_1080p30.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; \</code>
<code>[main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json" \</code>
<code>-f null -</code></code></pre>



<p>The log file that is produced by the VMAF computation is very comprehensive. It provides a frame-wise score of VMAF and its constituent metrics, along with the aggregate score (if that’s all you are looking for). </p>



<p>Here is an example of the VMAF file. </p>

<h2>What is PSNR and How Is It Calculated?</h2>



<p>From Wikipedia, </p>



<p><em><strong>Peak signal-to-noise ratio, often abbreviated&nbsp;PSNR, is an engineering term for the ratio between the maximum possible power of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signal</a>&nbsp;and the power of corrupting&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noise</a>&nbsp;that affects the fidelity of its representation.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>So, for a video, you are essentially trying to compute how much noise or pixel corruption has been introduced due to the video compression process which is essentially lossy (mainly due to Quantization). </p>



<p>The first step is to compute the Mean Squared Error or MSE. The formula is shown below where I and K represent the original and destination images respectively and <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are the height and width of the images respectively. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a34719b4f391dba26b3e8e4460b7595d62eece4" alt="{\mathit  {MSE}}={\frac  {1}{m\,n}}\sum _{{i=0}}^{{m-1}}\sum _{{j=0}}^{{n-1}}[I(i,j)-K(i,j)]^{2}" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Once you have the MSE, you can compute the PSNR using the formula shown below. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc22801ed1232ff1231c4156b589de5c32063a8a" alt="{\begin{aligned}{\mathit  {PSNR}}&amp;=10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}^{2}}{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}{{\sqrt  {{\mathit  {MSE}}}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}\right)-10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\end{aligned}}" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Here,&nbsp;<em>MAX<sub>I</sub></em>&nbsp;is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per sample, this is 255. </p>



<h2>How to Calculate PSNR using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>You don’t have to go through all those calculations while using FFmpeg. All you need to do use the filter module <code>lavfi</code> and tell it to compute the PSNR. That’s it. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi psnr=stats_file=psnr_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>FFmpeg will print the average PSNR on the console while the log file will contain a frame-wise list of the MSE and the PSNR for the Luma and Chroma planes (y, u, and v). An example is shown below – </p>



<pre><code>n:1 mse_avg:54.96 mse_y:72.51 mse_u:27.98 mse_v:11.74 psnr_avg:30.73 psnr_y:29.53 psnr_u:33.66 psnr_v:37.43 
 n:2 mse_avg:69.70 mse_y:93.80 mse_u:31.01 mse_v:12.02 psnr_avg:29.70 psnr_y:28.41 psnr_u:33.22 psnr_v:37.33 
 n:3 mse_avg:72.74 mse_y:98.37 mse_u:31.02 mse_v:11.96 psnr_avg:29.51 psnr_y:28.20 psnr_u:33.21 psnr_v:37.35 
 n:4 mse_avg:73.11 mse_y:98.94 mse_u:31.14 mse_v:11.76 psnr_avg:29.49 psnr_y:28.18 psnr_u:33.20 psnr_v:37.43 </code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>How to Calculate SSIM using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>Finally, let’s take a look at computing SSIM using FFmpeg. Again looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definition of SSIM</a>, </p>



<p><em><strong>The&nbsp;structural similarity&nbsp;index measure&nbsp;(SSIM) is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos. SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_quality#Classification_of_objective_video_quality_metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full reference metric</a>; in other words, the measurement or prediction of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image quality</a>&nbsp;is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference.</strong></em></p>



<p>Calculating SSIM using FFmpeg is very similar to calcuating PSNR. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi ssim=stats_file=ssim_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>The output of this command is going to look like this – </p>



<pre><code>[Parsed_ssim_0 @ 0000029c82894300] SSIM Y:0.926845 (11.357537) U:0.876798 (9.093807) V:0.860658 (8.559193) All:0.907472 (10.337287)</code></pre>



<p>And the log file will give you information on the SSIM values for each of the planes (Y, U, and V) along with the aggregate for each of the frames of the video. </p>



<pre><code> n:1 Y:0.930033 U:0.926453 V:0.913508 All:0.926682 (11.347897)
 n:2 Y:0.919140 U:0.915343 V:0.910900 All:0.917134 (10.816226)
 n:3 Y:0.922417 U:0.915795 V:0.910959 All:0.919404 (10.936853)
 n:4 Y:0.920077 U:0.916443 V:0.912994 All:0.918291 (10.877300)
 n:5 Y:0.926438 U:0.927597 V:0.917905 All:0.925209 (11.261518)
 n:6 Y:0.920619 U:0.919988 V:0.918780 All:0.920207 (10.980375)</code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>That’s it folks – now you know how to calculate three very important objective metrics for video quality evaluation — PSNR, VMAF, and SSIM. By computing all three and using them for analysis, it’s hard to be thrown off by artifacts that one metric can catch and the other can’t. </p>



<p>And like always, do spend a few minutes doing some visual testing (subjective) after you’re done with the objective scores! </p>

<p>Do you hate writing? Me too.</p>



<div><p>I am not talking about tweets or IG posts. I’m talking about 500 word long articles and essays. Most of us don’t like writing them. They take too much time and effort. </p><p>But is time really the problem? I don’t think so. We spend a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media" target="_blank">lot of time</a> on social media everyday right? Yeah time is not the problem.</p></div>



<p>So is effort the problem? Hmm let’s see. What happens when you open a blank page to write? Does anxiety kicks in? For me it does. </p>







<p>See, when I plan to write an article, usually I have a general idea about the topic I plan to write about. Though as soon as I open a blank page, my ideas start ruffling among each other making a mess. I don’t have clarity anymore. Everything starts falling apart, anxiety kicks in and …. I close the tab. Phew too much trouble for a few likes. </p>







<p>But after a few days / weeks those ideas start dying. The worst part is I see them dying without seeing the light of the day. That sucks. </p>



<p>And that’s why I try to write, and you should too.</p>



<p>Writing about a topic gives me a platform to just lay my ideas wide in the open. It’s like clearing my mental hard drive. It feels relaxing. </p>



<p>But If I just pour my random thoughts on a piece of paper that’s just writing, not <em>good</em> writing. I don’t want people to see a mishmash of ill shaped ideas, I want them to see a well ordered architecture where every part fits in. It’s not just for the sake of readers though, It’s for the ideas themselves. </p>



<p>Often about a topic, I have a range of musings. They’re like vectors, each with their own direction and magnitude. They make sense individually but to understand about the topic as a whole, all of them need to come in sync. Their rhythm has to match. That’s what good writing does. </p>



<blockquote><p>Good writing is just clear thinking expressed on paper.</p></blockquote>



<p>Writing about a topic makes me think about it from all the directions and perspectives. </p>



<p><em>What do I know about this topic?</em></p>



<p><em>Do I know enough?</em></p>



<p><em>If everything I know, correct?</em></p>



<p><em>How can I fill my gaps?</em></p>







<p>Jotting down everything I know helps me answer many of these questions. The ones still unanswered force me to research more. It’s a cycle.</p>



<p>Each draft of writing takes me one step closer to the complete and clear picture. The ultimate truth starts showing itself in the end. It’s a bliss moment.</p>



<p>The learning readers get is always a pleasant <em>byproduct</em>. </p>







<p>As one of my favorite writer <a href="https://twitter.com/Julian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Julian</a> says, </p>



<blockquote><p>The best writing is therapy that you publish for the world to learn from.</p></blockquote>







<p>After self-learning and expression, what is the next best thing writing offers?</p>



<p><strong>Relationships</strong>.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Writing online is a superpower.</p><p>Here’s a list of people who should start writing online.</p><p>1. The Niche Hobbyist</p><p>The Internet rewards people with obscure interests. Writing online will help you find other like-minded hobbyists who you wouldn’t be able to find in real-life.</p></div>— David Perell (@david_perell) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227612675334660099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<div><p>Writing online helps you create meaningful relationships, sometimes even indirectly. When people read well written articles, they can’t stop but appreciate the coherent thinking of the writer. These artifacts demonstrate author’s expertise in the given topic and hence increase their visibility.</p><p>Internet is a great place, good content can reach thousands of people with zero marketing. </p></div>



<blockquote><p>“By making it easy for people to find you online, you’ll create a vehicle for serendipity.” – <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell">@david_perell</a></p></blockquote>



<p>This visibility can get you job offers, network of influential people, money and many other things. </p>



<div><p>I can go on and on about the benefits of putting yourself out there but it’s a moo point. You have to experience the magic yourself. When a stranger thanks you for a piece of advice or a someone asks if they can use your work, it feels great. </p><p>Not trying to brag here but even as a crappy writer myself, I have experienced the joy of someone reaching out to me to thank me for my work. You should too!</p></div>

<div><p>Go ahead and write about something. Anything. <br>It can be about an experience, topic, musing … just anything. Put yourself out there and you will get better with time.

<p><br>To sum up, writing offers you a landscape to let your thoughts crash with each each other at full speed until they form a elegant symphony together. </p>



<p>This symphony creates a lasting impression on the audience and opens a gateway to serendipitous interactions.  </p>

        <article>
          <section><p>Earlier this year I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 to have as an AArch64
development machine. The fastest way to get familiar with an
instruction set is to write a disassembler for it and I’ve made one
for 64-bit <span>ARM</span> in R6RS Scheme as part of
the <a href="https://github.com/weinholt/machine-code">machine-code</a> project.
The instruction set is called <span>ARM</span> A64, instructions are always 32 bits
wide and they have a neat structure which is pretty fast to decode in&nbsp;software.</p>

<p>The architecture has 31 integer registers (x0-x30). There is also a
stack pointer register and a zero register that always contains
zeroes. Both these registers are encoded as register number 31, and
it’s up to each instruction if an operand can use the stack pointer or
the zero register. The x30 register is used to store the return
address. These registers are all 64-bit registers and the lower 32
bits can be accessed using the names w0-w31. Operations that write to
the lower 32 bits also clear the upper 32 bits, just like on&nbsp;<span>AMD64</span>.</p>
<p>There are also 32 registers usable as either floating point registers
or 128-bit vector registers. As vectors they support different
arrangements that are either 64 or 128 bits in total, containing
8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit quantities. There are many
instructions that operate on multiple quantities at the same time,
which is an interesting way to speed up code. Multiple loop iterations
can be run&nbsp;simultaneously.</p>
<p>The instructions are documented in the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0487/a/arm-architecture-reference-manual-armv8-for-armv8-a-architecture-profile"><span>ARM</span> ARM for ARMv8-A</a>. I’ve
counted, not including instruction aliases, 442 instruction mnemonics
(things like <span>ADD</span>, EOR, B.EQ, etc). They are organized in what is
basically a four-level table: main encoding, instruction group, decode
group and instruction. Chapter C4 of the manual follows the same
structure. This structure is nice for fast decoding, but it’s not
strictly necessary since all encodings at the instruction level still
need to have a unique&nbsp;meaning.</p>
<p>For each instruction mnemonic there can be multiple variants that
enable the instruction to handle different types of operands. An
example of this is the <span>FMUL</span> instruction that multiples two floating
point values. In a C program it would look like <code>a = b * c</code>. In A64
assembler it might look like one of these, depending on what the
surrounding code&nbsp;does:</p>
<pre><code><span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>s2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>d2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>4</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>d   
<span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]       
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>] 
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a few variants for a single mnemonic. Not all mnemonics
have this many variants, but depending on how one counts I estimate
that there are in total around 1000-2000 variants. The instruction set
designers had to fit all these variants into 32 bits, while at the
same time making space for instructions that encode relatively large
immediate operands, and not forgetting about leaving space for future
extensions. As if that wasn’t difficult enough, the instructions
should also be easy to decode with&nbsp;hardware.</p>

<p>I’ve extracted the tables from my disassembler, rendered them with
the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bit-field">bit-field package</a>, and
made them slightly interactive. If you’re reading this in a browser
you can see the encodings below. The thing to notice is that each
layer adds extra fixed bits: fields that must be a fixed 0 or 1 value.
(The last level, the instruction level, is not shown in this table).
Two encodings under the same parent always have some differences in
these fields, so that they can be separated by an instruction decoder.
Click an encoding to expand the next level of&nbsp;encodings.</p>




<p>There are many conventions in the field names. Instructions that take
register operands encode them in fields named <em>Rd</em>, <em>Rn</em> and <em>Rm</em>.
Immediate values (integers, <span>PC</span>-relative offsets, etc) are named <em>imm</em>.
Fields that change the type of operation tend to be called <em>op</em>N or
<em>opcode</em>. In general a few of the fields encode the operation (or the
size of the operation) and the rest encode the&nbsp;operands.</p>

<p>The image below shows the encoding space of the instruction set. The
<em>x</em> axis goes from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>-1 and encodes the lower 16 bits
of the instruction space, and the <em>y</em> axis contains the upper 16 bits.
The different colors denote different decode groups, i.e. all the
encodings at the third level of the table above. (There is probably a
better&nbsp;representation).</p>
<p><img src="https://weinholt.se/articles/arm-a64-instruction-set/a64-2048-crushed.png" title="Encoding space used by ARM A64" alt="An image showing the 32-bit
  encoding space. Mostly there are horizontal thick lines of different
  colors. This shows that the higher 16 bits tend to keep similar
  instructions together, although there is some mirroring around the
  middle of the image."></p>
<p>All the dark spots are places where ARMv8 does not have any allocated
instructions, or the encoding is reserved. For many instructions there
are some fields that have reserved encodings and these are also&nbsp;dark.</p>
<p>Even if instructions are kept to the fixed 32 bit encoding there is
still plenty of room for the instruction set to&nbsp;grow.</p>

<p><span>ARM</span> A64 is a quite clean instruction set with only a few quirks here
and there in its encoding. Compared to AMD64 it has twice the amount
of registers, a clean separation of load/store instructions, clean
RISCy operands (mostly one destination register and two source
registers) and of course the register names and most mnemonics are
totally different. Both have 128-bit vector registers and 64-bit
integer registers and a 64-bit address space. They look quite similar,
except everything’s&nbsp;different.</p>

<p>The why of why people use vim has been <a href="https://dev.to/iggredible/why-i-use-vim-2f40">covered fairly extensively</a>, so I thought I would spend a little time explaining why I <em>teach</em> vim to my high school students, even in 2020.</p>



<p>It all began when I was assigned a mixed class of ninth through twelfth grade students in computer science just after the financial collapse on 2008. Well, the financial collapse first brought me to teach Intro to Programming using VB 6.0 and Windows thin clients, which was an experience unto itself (thanks in part to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker">Conficker virus</a>). That experience is worth a separate blog post and is a good part of why one of my specialties is teaching computer security.</p>



<p>So here I am with all levels of student, including AP CS A (read: AP CS Java), and obsolete Windows PCs (at least the thin clients were gone). I couldn’t install any software, wanted to teach C, had to teach Java, and had very few options (these were the days before online web based IDEs).</p>



<p>I had experience with the UNIX command line, primarily Sun Workstations, thanks to my wonderful education at <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">UCSC</a>, so that wasn’t an issue. I had played with Linux in the 1990s to a bit of success, but hadn’t touched it for almost a decade. So I found an old Pentium 2 carcass in the the garbage outside my condo complex, installed a hard drive, and tried this new (to me) flavor of Linux called, strangely, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>



<p>I quickly realized this machine could have all the students coding at one, discovered the wonder that is <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">putty.exe</a> (it doesn’t require any installation to run!) to connect the obsolete PCs to the server and soon my students were off and coding.</p>



<p>Why did I teach them vim? I wish I could say I agonized over all the options at the time and decided vim was the best pedagogical solution, but the reality of the situation was that vi was what I used in college because my father taught me vi. You see, I am lucky to have a father who worked in the industry and is even somewhat of a <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qed.html">footnote in text editor history</a>. So I taught vi (later vim) because it is what I knew. A running theme in many computer science teacher’s trials by fire… teaching something because it is what they know. I will go as far as to argue that it is more important that the teacher knows the editor, and especially the programming language, rather than assigning any importance to one correct editor or one correct language that all teachers should teach.</p>



<p>Years later, though, I still teach vim and the command line. So here is how I justify my decision, even if only to myself.</p>



<p>It just works. Every time I go to a new school, it takes time to get the software installed necessary to run IDEs. I remember walking into one school in which the AP CS A class was flailing away with Eclipse on Mac OS X because the students needed, and didn’t have, administrator access. I have an amazing tech department at my current job, but even here it took us weeks to figure out how to deploy Visual Studio Code on the student’s MacBook Airs and then we had to figure out how to deploy Python3 and Java. So there’s no confusion, I teach vim along with many IDEs and I fully believe it is my responsibility to teach multiple platforms and multiple IDEs, but the CLI and vim are always my safety net.</p>



<p>My students can program in any number of of languages on a now cloud based CLI Linux machine (thank you <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> – both of whom offer a $5/month plan – just. happy customer!). By using the CLI, I can support literally any type of computer connecting (including iPads, although the lack of a virtual esc key drives me batty as a vim user, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">ChromeBooks</a>). Students can connect from anywhere in the world and things just work. All of this became infinitely important in the remote and hybrid learning experience of the pandemic. And this is all possible because the students use vim.</p>



<p>I keep track of as many of my students that major in CS and a running theme is they all profusely thank me for teaching them vim and the CLI. Too many colleges start CS1 with an IDE and then throw the CS2 students into the deep end with the CLI. Not everyone is as lucky as I was in regards to having a father well versed in the CLI.</p>



<p>And yes, there are online IDEs these days, but I’ve found those to be full of their own pitfalls, privacy issues, and costs and find doing any advanced work using them to be very difficult if not impossible.</p>



<p>Also, to be clear, both nano and Emacs work quite well in the context of CLI Linux and I don’t make any claim that teachers should use vim over those equally acceptable command line text editors except for one small argument. Most people agree, computer security pretty much requires knowledge of the command line and a text editor. I always tell my students that the one editor they are likely to find already installed on a machine is vim and it is a bad day when you have to install another editor. Maybe just an issue for students interested in ethical penetration testing…</p>

<p>In 2007, just after his cancer diagnosis, Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0">a well received lecture on Time Management</a>. These are my notes (<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf">slides here</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/time-management-by-randy-pausch">transcript here</a>).</p>

    <li>We are in a "Time Famine" - nobody says they have "too much time". Yet The typical office worker wastes almost 2 hrs a day at work, and 28 hours a week on TV. This isn't just a one-off problem - you can't solve it one week and then go back to normal - it's systemic and requries change in fundamental processes to address this once and for all.</li>
    <li>The goal is to have fun, be happier, lead a more meaningful life. If you're not going to have fun, why do it?</li>
    <li>Being successful doesn't make you manage your time well. Managing your time well does make you successful.</li>

      <p>He is also extremely respectful - being humble to specific members of the audience ("Gabe is REALLY in good shape", "I am NOT smarter than Jim Calhoun", "Am I giving a talk with Alf Weaver in the audience?"), as well as the venue/general audience itself ("there aren't many better PhD programs in history than this one").</p>

November 14, 2020 | https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-i-read | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-i-read">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I try to read a lot, though I'm not nearly as voracious a reader as people who have a reputation for it. I have no idea how Marc Andreessen or Patrick Collison read as much as they do, especially given the enormous demands on their time. The most plausible explanation is that they're aliens with ungodly information processing abilities. I'm human, so I shoot for 40 pages every day, and fail maybe a third of the time. That works out to about 10,000 pages or ~20 books every year. </p><p>Reading twenty books a year gets you a lot. Consider: one book gives you more knowledge about a subject than almost every other person on the planet, because people don't read. Two books on the same subject give you more knowledge than almost any reader, because people don't read two books about the same thing. How many people who read The Power Broker went on to read a second book about Robert Moses? I'd wager not many.</p><p>Beyond two books on a subject, there is a long utility dip. People who bothered to read more than two books about Robert Moses, are either obsessed with him or study him for a living, which means they've read much, much more about him. So two books on a subject, at least with respect to competitive edge, is an inflection point. After you read two, you get diminishing returns.</p><p>There is a way to get around this limitation. A single book is a pinhole view of the world set up by the author. You have no input into its contents, and therefore cannot change the orientation of this view. But you do choose the books you select. That means you can stitch together multiple pinhole views into a unique lens to examine the world— one that no one else will have unless they use the same list of books to stitch together the same lens. </p><p>For example, you can look at the world through history of technology that became ubiquitous. Here is one possible list of books to stitch together this lens: <a href="https://amzn.to/36fB6Vb">The Victorian Internet</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2GHE8Jh">Empires of Light</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ua2P49">The Wright Brothers</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/38pdoIY">The Network</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3n3SeEf">Hackers</a>. Very few people in the world read all five of these books. Even within Silicon Valley, where everyone's living depends on creating new ubiquitous technology, your understanding of how technology becomes ubiquitous will be in the 95th percentile (and likely higher) if you read these five. You will now be armed with a unique instrument that few others possess, and assuming twenty books per year, it only took you three months to acquire.</p><p>Another example is to look at American history and the dynamics of failure by studying biographies of U.S. presidents who sought reelection and lost. There were ten: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren, Benjamin Harrison, William H. Taft, Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and now Donald J. Trump. It may be difficult to stomach ten presidential biographies in a row, but it's doable to read five. That's enough to pick up a new lens. Another three months; another sophisticated instrument to examine the world at your disposal.</p><p>I settled on clusters of five and almost never read a single book in isolation. Less than five feel lacking; more than five gets repetitive. Every cluster has a goal of the form "study <code>X</code> through <code>Y</code>". Study American history through technological expansion, or study failure through one term presidents are just a few examples. I try to be creative and make <code>Y</code> unusual. For instance, everyone likes to read about presidents who are believed to be successful. A simple trick is to inverse it and read about unsuccessful ones instead. Or skip the presidents altogether, and read about vice presidents. It doesn't matter what <code>Y</code> is because you're trying to study <code>X</code>, and it's more fun to make <code>Y</code> unusual.</p><p>I don't bother diversifying books within a cluster by time period, cultural or linguistic background of the author, or anything like that. I simply try and find the best books on the subject. Sometimes they turn out to be diverse along some axes; other times they're homogenous. I never read forewords or prefaces and always finish every book in a cluster. I prefer paper to digital, and used books to new ones. I never take notes or, god forbid, create flashcards. My goal is to suck the juice out of a book, not to hold on to pieces of the carcass. If I ever need to remember a specific detail, it's always waiting for me on the shelf.</p><p>This system gives me four new instruments per year, each capable of inspecting the world in a different way. Rather than pick the instruments at random I try to be strategic and collect them into a mental lab. I visualize the lab as a room with multiple stations. Each station has a collection of related instruments on it. When I'm faced with a problem I can go to the right station and examine the problem through the instruments available on that station. All this is physically materialized on my bookshelf. Some day when I become less mobile, I plan to dedicate a literal room to it.</p><p>I don't maintain lists of books I want to read, and don't plan a sequence of instruments to acquire in advance. Once I'm done reading a cluster of books, I ask myself: <em>what instrument can I add to double the utility of my lab</em>? Another way to phrase this question is "what is the most important subject that I know the least about?" It's easy to think of many possible answers to this question; I then pick the answer that seems the most interesting, construct a new cluster of five books, and recurse.</p><p>Four instruments per year may not seem like much, but consider: in five years you will have about twenty mental instruments, all of which interrelate and reinforce each other. In ten years you will have an impressive lab of forty instruments. And it will be unique— no other mental lab on the planet will be able to inspect the world in the way that yours can.</p><p>Because the instruments are constructed from books, they are endlessly upgradeable. Sometimes you might choose to upgrade an existing instrument to increase its power and get higher resolution, rather than acquire a new one. You can do that one book at a time. To use the examples above, you can read another book about ubiquitous technology, or another book about a one term president.</p><p>If you organize your reading this way, your bookshelf won't be arranged by genre like a typical bookstore. Rather than having sections for e.g. biographies, essays, novels, military history, all sorted by author, you will instead have sections for addressing different problems, likely sorted by clusters of books in order that you encountered them. The arrangement won't make sense to anyone except you. But you'll be able to find what you need instantaneously, and your capacity to examine the world from different perspectives will dramatically increase.</p><p>Waiting five, ten, fifteen years to build a mental lab may seem like an impossibly long time. But you don’t have to wait. It’s a pleasure to read about the Wright brothers, or proliferation of the telegraph, or early computer culture! And in a measly three months you’ll have acquired a fresh way of looking at the world. Already you will be a different person. Then you keep going, and keep looking for new instruments to double the utility of existing ones. And in one year? You will look back at today’s version of yourself and find it unrecognizable.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Read ~40 pages/day, assume 30% failure rate. That's 10k pages and ~20 books annually. Pick a problem, and read clusters of five books to study that problem from a unique perspective. Visualize each cluster as an instrument to inspect the world. Collect instruments into a mental lab, with various stations for related instruments. You can upgrade the instruments one book at a time. Have your bookshelf reflect this mental image. Win the decade, not the day. Start now and never stop.</p></div></div>]]>

		<div>

			
<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>


<pre title="">const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();
</pre>


<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(commitment) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(114));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const storedCommitment = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50, 114));
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);
    if (!(await sodium.sodium_memcmp(storedCommitment, commitment))) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect commitment value");
    }
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}

<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance could <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/12/oneill-rpt-amr/">cost the world $100 trillion by 2050</a>, and approximately kills 700,000 per year. Some in the scientific community say it could be as bad as cancer. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768623/">principal public health problems</a> of the 21st century. The World Health Organisation published <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed">a list of bacteria of which new antibiotics are urgently needed</a>, and superbug “Staph” was Priority high. It’s a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25498-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-now-a-global-epidemic/">global epidemic</a>.</p>



<p>We should be rational optimists, as Matt Ridley explains with evidence in his book. Through science and technology the world gets better via our collective brain.</p>



<p><a href="https://botanixpharma.com/">Botanix Pharmaceuticals</a> (Botanix) has made a scientific breakthrough. In September 2020, Botanix proved its product&nbsp; BTX 1801 kills superbug Staph (aka MRSA or golden Staph) without allowing resistance to develop. <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20200908/pdf/44mf662gw8dbkd.pdf">It was done in human skin</a>. This product is designed for Surgical Site Infections (SSI) which costs hospitals US$10 billion per year. The Phase 2a study is due in Q4 2020. They did this a year after they <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20190801/pdf/4473szphv8b084.pdf">raised US$40 million at a valuation of US$198 million</a>.</p>



<p>There was already evidence Cannabidiol (CBD) was antibacterial, which is used in the product. This new data supports bigger studies for a potential new antibiotic. There is a big need for new antibiotics due to antibiotic resistance. The problem is that it is very hard to make these scientific breakthroughs. Botanix has made a breakthrough for the world, and the data will be used by other scientists to save lives. Botanix also has a cash runway to take its clinical pipeline to December 2021 (excluding FDA approved Phase 3 Acne).</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">approximately 27 million</a> surgical procedures in the U.S per year. Approximately 5% get infected, which leads to 1.35 million SSI’s per year in the U.S. Occurrence of SSI is estimated to increase hospital stay by 7 to 10 days and add over <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">$3,000 in costs of care</a>. Globally, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5435b2b9e4b0e1fd29fa9d26/t/5aa2b3374192023932fb6690/1520612157567/Surgical%26AnaesthesiaDataReport.pdf">there are approximately 313 million</a> surgical procedures per year. If 5% of surgical procedures lead to infections, that’s 15.6 million SSI’s globally.</p>



<p>In the U.S there are 1.35 million SSI’s per year, multiply that by $3,000 costs, and it equals $4 billion. SSI’s cost U.S hospitals $4 billion per year. If BTX 1801 is priced at $100, that equals $135 million yearly revenue in the U.S – a huge drop in hospital costs. Presume the product will last 10 years, and that equals $1.3 billion in revenue. Globally, potential annual revenue could be $1.5 billion (SSI’s multiplied by the $100 price).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this is 1 of 3 products in the Botanix clinical pipeline. Pending studies are FDA approved <a href="http://marksita.com/botanix-pharmaceuticals">Phase 3 Acne</a> and Phase 2 Rosacea.</p>



<p>A recent study found it costs on average <a href="https://amr.solutions/2020/03/06/what-does-an-antibiotic-cost-to-develop-what-is-it-worth-how-to-afford-it/">$1.3 billion to get a new drug approved</a>. By using synthetic Cannabidiol, Botanix is able to make significantly better drugs. Botanix has a competitive advantage, and the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">FDA Fast Track Status</a> application (due to the <a href="https://smallcaps.com.au/botanix-pharmaceuticals-receives-fda-grant-antibacterial-product-btx-1801/">FDA Qualified Infectious Disease Product</a> status) will make it stronger.</p>



<p>Antibiotics is the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/antibiotics-dilemma-running-out-of-drugs-to-treat-superbugs/7281438">$40 billion drug market</a> that no company wants a part of. <strong>Until now.</strong></p>

Essentially this was the CRISPR Nobel Prize. If enough of CRISPR has already come so that it is worthy of a Nobel Prize I can’t imagine there is much place to go from here.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4bf038d4-7fff-ec28-e41c-6ded5276f0c8"><p dir="ltr"><span>Modifying the genome of organisms has always been of great interest to scientists. Adding or removing genes allows us to understand how things work and allows us to create microorganisms, plants or animals(humans are animals right?) that have traits never seen before. Knowingly modifying the genome of organisms has been done since people understood breeding. Inserting specific DNA elements began in the 1970s but it wasn’t very targeted and was mostly just inserting genes into random places in genomes. It wasn’t until the 1990s that people started to be able to do targeted genome modifications.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Targeted genome modifications allow highly specific and accurate changes to an organism’s DNA. The co-opting of the cellular mechanism of homologous recombination is the backbone of all modern genome editing technologies including Zinc Finger Nucleases(ZFNs), Transcription activator-like effector nuclease(TALENs) and Clustered regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats(CRISPR). Both ZFNs and TALENs are mostly synthetic, i.e. they contain a portion that can be engineered to target DNA and a synthetically attached nuclease that will cleave DNA to initiate recombination and gene editing. CRISPR is almost completely natural which makes one wonder how there are so many patents on it’s use, yikes. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>CRISPR can modify most any living cell but so can ZFNs, TALENs and other technologies. So why then was CRISPR </span><span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2014/12/04/170211/who-owns-the-biggest-biotech-discovery-of-the-century/">heralded as the discovery of the century</a></span><span> by the MIT Tech Review? Simply, CRISPR is just easier to use because it uses nucleic acid targeting. That makes it cost less and take less time to produce genetic modifications.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So what has CRISPR made possible? Not much really. Most everything done with CRISPR can be done with one of these other technologies albeit these others are slower and more expensive. CRISPR allows the scaling of genetic engineering so that time and money are much less of a factor. It is the cloud computing of biology at least in my mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Despite claims by scientists and pharma companies there is little chance CRISPR will ever be widely used in the clinic to directly treat disease. That is because it suffers from all the same faults as its predecessors and maybe even more so. Gene editing has low efficiency in adult animals(yes humans are animals) no matter the technique used. For instance, if you have a disease that affects the brain you can probably only modify &lt;1% of cells even using the best delivery techniques available.&nbsp;Really, the only way to get rid of genetically inherited diseases using gene editing is by modifying embryos.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Misleading as it has been CRISPR can’t actually make specific changes to a gene easily in an adult animal. That is because it requires what is called a donor template, basically just a DNA template that cells can use to create the genome modifications. There is no efficient way to use donor templates in an adult animal so all genome edits would need to be gene knock-outs only i.e. you can only use CRISPR to destroy bad genes not modify them to make them good genes. As you can imagine this is very limited in scope when it comes to diseases that can and should be reasonably targeted using genome editing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>To date all human clinical trials involve gene editing technology whether CRISPR or otherwise have failed to show any change in the disease condition. I don’t see this as likely to change. While there might be a disease that can be helped despite the low efficiency of CRISPR chances are that normal gene therapy, that doesn’t edit the genome, will be easier and more successful. There are very few diseases that would require genome editing as opposed to just adding an extra copy of the gene to cells like gene therapy does. It’s not all just conjecture either, just recently in August 2020 the pharma giant Abbvie ended a partnership it had with Editas, one of the major CRISPR players. Apparently, I’m not the only one who sees CRISPR's future in the clinic as limited.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So what applications are left for CRISPR besides contributing to research? Some people are betting on diagnostics, using CRISPR’s ability to target specific sequences of DNA. While this seems reasonable it is unlikely that tried and true methods for DNA detection that use PCR will ever be significantly deplatformed. After that we are scraping the bottom of the bowl of guac.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>I have been around CRISPR since near the beginning. The only thing that has remained constant is the hype. Even that has been fading. While it is hard to measure hype Google Trends indicates that for 2020 the topic and search term CRISPR is on track to be the lowest searched since 2016. We now know that CRISPR gene drives don’t really work. No success for CRISPR in the clinic. CRISPR has already been used to edit human embryos. Really, the only thing keeping CRISPR hype alive is probably the MIT Tech Review. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>In 2006, RNAi gene silencing was given the Nobel Prize. MIT called it the </span><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2003/rnai-0108"><span>breakthrough of the decade</span></a><span>. I remember everyone being so excited about it! It was the hot topic at conferences and even my graduate school interviews. While RNAi was and always has been a great benefit to researchers its actual application has been extremely limited. It’s taken 13 years from the RNAi Nobel Prize to bring something to the clinic and even then the two drugs have been a bit underwhelming. According to Google Scholar, papers even mentioning RNAi have been on the decline for the past 6 years. The drug approved in the past few years haven't even slowed the decline.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>I am sure people will continue to use CRISPR for years to come but I hate to break it to you CRISPR is dead.</span></p><br></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="divbodyholder">  <div id="divbody"> <div> <h3> Why Twitter can't agree on a simple math equation </h3> <p> November 14, 2020 — Chris Foster </p> <p>I cam across this tweet this morning, followed by the replies of approximately 9.7 thousand people arguing over what the correct answer actually is.</p> <!-- Content Breaker --> <blockquote width="400"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">how smart are my oomfs <a href="https://t.co/YVxtzhNx4c">pic.twitter.com/YVxtzhNx4c</a></p>— dev ᴺᴹ ᴬᴳ (@iambuterastann) <a href="https://twitter.com/iambuterastann/status/1327101241390886915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  <p>The complete and total conviction in the replies is notable. I’ve seen the same thing on Facebook and I often get caught up with the verocity that people argue with each other. The trick is usually the same, but in this specific case users come mostly to two answers: \(1\) and \(9\). Which is right? The answer is that they <strong>both are</strong>! Read on for why.</p>  <p>As mentioned, there are roughly two categories of answers: \(1\) and \(9\). There’s also some weird ones, like \(0\) being another common one, but these are primarily arithmetic mistakes. First, let’s focus on how someone would arrive at \(9\).</p> <p>Remember PEMDAS? You may have also learned it as BEDMAS. This is a rule taught that helps you remember the order of operations for algebraic notation. We follow this order: <strong>P</strong>arentheses, <strong>e</strong>xponents, <strong>m</strong>ultiplication / <strong>d</strong>ivision, and then <strong>a</strong>ddition / <strong>s</strong>ubtraction. You do each of these steps from left to right. Note that multiplication / division as well as addition / subtraction happen at the same time, rather than multiplication <em>followed by</em> division for example (ironically that leads to a valid answer for invalid reasons and further fuels argument).</p> <p>If you strictly follow PEMDAS you get this result:</p><p> \[6 \div 2(1 + 2) \\ 6 \div 2(3) \\ 6 \div 2 \times 3 \\ 9\] </p><p>Did you see what happened in that second step? Let’s re-look:</p><p> \[6 \div 2(3) \\ 6 \div 2 \times 3\] </p><p>Keep that in mind as we look at what the second category of users, those who concluded the answer is \(1\), are doing:</p><p> \[6 \div 2(1 + 2)\\ 6 \div 2(3)\\ 6 \div 6\\ 1\] </p><p>Did you see the difference? Users who conclude \(1\) multiplied \(2\) and \(3\) together <strong>before</strong> evaluating the multiplication and division left-to-right. You might think “that’s not following PEMDAS!” and you would be right. So why are they doing this?</p> <p>The notation \(2(3)\) can be called an <em><a href="https://www.themathdoctors.org/order-of-operations-implicit-multiplication/">implicit multiplication by juxtaposition</a></em>. It’s <em>implicit</em> because there is no actual multiplication symbol, and it’s understood to be multiplication with the brackets because it’s <em>juxtaposed</em> (“close to”) with them.</p> <p>In some notations it is a common convention to treat these implied multiplications as <em>higher priority</em> than other multiplications. For example you might see authors write things like \(\frac{x}{2(3x + y)}\) as \(x \div 2(3x + y)\), which is different than \(x \div 2 \times (3x + y)\).</p>  <p>So who is correct? A math expression must have only one real answer right? The point of math is it is supposed to be true and inarguable, right?</p> <p>That’s all fair, but “math” is different than “math notation”. Mathematics models real relationships in our physical world, but the things we write down are just an agreed upon language for communicating it.</p> <p>For example, if there is a four legged creature with a cute nose right in front of me:</p> <p><img src="https://fosterelli.co/image/why-twitter-cant-agree-on-a-simple-math-equation/dog.jpg" alt="A cute dog doing some math"></p> <p>and I tell you that I see <em>a dog</em>, you know what I mean. But if I only spoke Spanish and I called it <em>un perro</em>, you may not know what I meant. That doesn’t change the inarguable fact that there is a furry four legged creature in front of me, but you might only understand what I’m trying to communicate if we’re speaking the same notation.</p> <p>There’s lots of examples of this in math. Take something as simple as \(\times\). It should always mean multiplication right? Well, in vector algebra, everyone agreed that \(\times\) actually means something called the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Definition">cross product</a></em> of two vectors, denoted by the formula \(a \times b = \left\| a \right\| \left\| b \right\| \sin(\theta) n\) or to demonstrate visually:</p> <p><img src="https://fosterelli.co/image/why-twitter-cant-agree-on-a-simple-math-equation/vector.png" alt="A visual example of the cross product"></p> <p>There is some overlapping intuition, but this obviously looks and feels nothing like arithmetic multiplication, which is a series of repeated additions. However that’s what we decided to use \(\times\) for when talking about vectors. There are many examples of overlapping notation in math. As long as we agree and can communicate mathematical ideas, the notation isn’t really important.</p> <p>So what users really disagree about is <em>how to read this equation</em>. Does the author who wrote this equation mean \(6 \div 2 \times (1 + 2)\) or do they mean \(6 \div (2 \times (1 + 2))\)? If this was in a textbook, or part of a larger series of equations, it would be clear from the context. With only this single equation to go on, it’s actually unclear what the author intended. Both interpretations are valid.</p>  <p>Of course the vagueness is deliberate in this case. It gets everyone on social media riled up as they think <em>obviously</em> their understanding is correct and <em>obviously</em> the other person is wrong. <em>Didn’t they take 5th grade math?!</em> But really – both groups are making reasonable interpretations and the equation itself is poorly written. If you were to give someone an equation with no other context at all, you should <em>always</em> use appropriate brackets to make it clear what you are communicating.</p> <p>For more fun, you can see that even calculators themselves will differ on how to interpret this question. Some calculators process input left-to-right, some follow PEMDAS, and others will follow PEMDAS while giving implicit multiplication by juxtaposition a higher priority.</p> <blockquote data-conversation="none" width="400"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Different calculators give different answers - it depends on the choices made by the people making them. In the last pic it automatically added parentheses when giving the answer, it’s just down to convention chosen: <a href="https://t.co/DB9J9j2zTx">pic.twitter.com/DB9J9j2zTx</a></p>— Dave (@DavePunFun) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavePunFun/status/1327327770750271488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  <p>The real solution is to make this a more official rule that standard education teaches. Right now this is something that students in later education mostly learn by convention – which leads to a lot of confusion when people clearly interpret it differently but have a hard time explaining <em>why</em>. Textbooks can also be awful as they might explain PEMDAS and then give the implicit multiplication priority with no explicit mention of how that works.</p> <p>Anyway, I see something similar on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter every few months and I thought it was worth writing up a beginner-friendly explanation that I can reference later. Hopefully it was helpful to you too!</p>  </div>  </div> </div></div>]]>

                <p>Most programming languages barely differ from each other apart from superficial syntax differences, but not Idris. Idris, having a type system supporting dependent types and other innovative ideas, opens up a host of possibilities few other language provides.</p>

<p>When we want to ensure that a piece of code works as intended the usual tool we use is testing. Testing provides plenty of benefits, but wouldn’t you prefer to encode your tests right in the type signature and let the compiler decide if your code is correct given those constraints? With Idris you can do exactly that.</p>

<p>Let’s investigate how by comparing a very simple list operation, append, also called (++) in Haskell and Idris. Append in Haskell has the following type signature:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Prelude</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Sharing most of the syntax and lot of the type system with Haskell, the append for lists looks very similar in Idris:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Idris</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span>
<span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>List</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span>
<span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>Strings</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>Vect</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When we have a look at the Prelude.List.(++), we can see that it matches the Haskell version - it tells us that it takes two lists and returns a third one - it doesn’t say a single word about the lengths of those lists. But if we look at append for the Prelude.Vect type (vectors are a kind of lists with a size), we see the signature describing the size of the vector:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>Vect</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In dependent type terminology a vector is a list indexed over its length, or in laymen’s terms the type of a vector is a list with a size. This is remotely similar to the concept of fixed sized arrays, (for example, in Go) a [4]int is not the same type as a [5]int. However in Idris, we can not only describe that those lists have different type, but as we can see above we can also express how a given property - in this case the length of a list - changes as a result of a function. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">Wikipedia succintly states</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A promising type-based verification approach is dependently typed programming, in which the types of functions include (at least part of) those functions’ specifications, and type-checking the code establishes its correctness against those specifications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To understand the importance of this it is not enough to inspect the the above functions’ type signature. What meets the eye there could be considered documentation. But the real epiphany comes when we start to implement a function after specifying its signature. Let’s examine the source code of <a href="https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/blob/43127b17a765dbab2e7bcb6be2f6f2efc7a42386/libs/base/Data/VectType.idr#L181">append</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>|||</span> <span>Append</span> <span>two</span> <span>vectors</span>
<span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>
<span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span>      <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>ys</span>
<span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span> <span>++</span> <span>ys</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But what happens if we intentionally brake the implementation, for example by appending the first argument to itself and ignoring the second argument entirely? The resulting Vector will have a length of <b>m + m</b>, which is clearly different than the <b>m + n</b> stated in the signature.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>import</span> <span>Data.Vect</span>

<span>vapp</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>

<span>vapp</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>vapp</span> <span>xs</span> <span>xs</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/blob/43127b17a765dbab2e7bcb6be2f6f2efc7a42386/test/tutorial006/tutorial006a.idr">link</a>)</p>

<p>The compiler tells exactly what we suspected:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Type</span> <span>checking</span> <span>./</span><span>vapp</span><span>.</span><span>idr</span>
<span>vapp</span><span>.</span><span>idr</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span>23</span><span>:</span><span>When</span> <span>elaborating</span> <span>right</span> <span>hand</span> <span>side</span> <span>of</span> <span>vapp</span><span>:</span>

        <span>Can't</span> <span>unify</span>
                <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>
        <span>with</span>
                <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>plus</span> <span>n</span> <span>m</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>
        
        <span>Specifically</span><span>:</span>
                <span>Can't</span> <span>unify</span>
                        <span>plus</span> <span>n</span> <span>n</span>
                <span>with</span>
                        <span>plus</span> <span>n</span> <span>m</span>
<span>Metavariables</span><span>:</span> <span>Main</span><span>.</span><span>vapp</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above example shows an interesting quality of Idris’ type system: the correctness of the code is checked against any specification in the functions’ type. If the implementation does not meet the specification a compile error is triggered. Naturally, any property not described by those specifications will not interest the compiler. Let’s say we implement our ‘vapp’ function the following way:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>vapp1</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>
<span>vapp1</span> <span>Nil</span>               <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>ys</span>
<span>vapp1</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>x'</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span>   <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>vapp</span> <span>xs</span> <span>ys</span>
<span>vapp1</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span>         <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>vapp</span> <span>xs</span> <span>ys</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This compiling program almost works perfectly but it does have a quirk; the first element from the first argument is present twice, once on the 1st position correctly, and on the second position incorrectly, deleting the second element:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>*</span><span>vapp</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>vapp1</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>6</span><span>]</span>
<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>6</span> <span>Integer</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So we have proved that whatever is stated in the type signature is guaranteed to be correct - but nothing else may be. In our append example we state that ‘given vector a and vector b, calling append with those vectors as arguments will yield a vector with a length of length a + length b’. It does not state that the resulting vector will contain any element from the argument vectors, or if the order is preserved or anything else! But this is pretty obvious since how could the compiler decide wether a code is correct or not if we do not tell it the criteria to judge a piece of code by. Mind reading based programming is not invented yet, unfortunately.</p>

<p>To say the least, dependent types have the potential to become a new useful tool in a programmer’s toolbox - and there is a certain idealistic beauty in building on top of formally verified, guaranteed to be correct code.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Having been a reviewer for numerous machine learning conferences now,
there are some repeated issues I want to point out, concerning the way
authors describe mathematical concepts in their papers. I hope that my
suggestions will serve in particular those that are new to machine
learning and for whom the task of reading a paper with a ‘bad’
mathematical style might seem a daunting prospect. Without further ado,
here are some suggestions for improving your research article.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Your primary objective when writing mathematics should be to build
intuition for readers. This does <em>not</em> mean that you should sacrifice
any rigour or precision—I am just advocating for considering that
a reader of your paper is not an expert in the subject matter yet. If
you want readers to take away some wisdom from the paper, you have to
address their intuition first. No one except an expert in your field
will be swayed by long-winded proofs.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I am <em>not</em> advocating for sloppy thinking, sloppy writing, or
‘hand-waving’ in your proofs.  I am just saying that the way you lay out
your overall argument should be based on intuition, such that even
reviewers that are not experts in your domain can follow along. If you
only write a paper geared towards a very small audience, you are
reducing its impact and make your life harder because it will almost be
impossible to find good reviewers for it in the conference cycle.</p>

<p>Whenever you introduce notation, try to remain <em>consistent</em>. For
example, if you want to name three objects, prefer calling them $a$, $b$, and
$c$, instead of $\alpha$, $\mathbf{B}$, and $\mathfrak{c}^\prime$.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, follow established terminology—such as calling loss
terms $\mathcal{L}$—but do not assume that the reader is aware of
these conventions. <em>Always</em> take the time to at least briefly introduce
your notation.</p>
<p>This point is in fact closely related to the second issue, namely…</p>

<p>Some people aim to be extremely precise and <em>always</em> employ index-based
notations. For example, instead of referring to objects $a$ and $b$, it
is always $a_1$ and $a_2$ or something. There is nothing wrong with this
in principle, but I would suggest to always strive for as little index
notations as possible and, if only two objects of the same type are needed,
why not use a $\prime$ symbol (<code>\prime</code> in LaTeX) instead of indices?
This can often increase readability and makes you less error-prone
because you do not have to keep track of the indices any more. For
example, in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03854">survey on graph kernels</a>,
we try to always speak of $G$ and $G^\prime$ when we need to refer to
two graphs. This leaves the indices free for when you actually <em>have</em> to
index something, for example because you are aggregating over objects
arising from a certain set.</p>
<p>In addition, try to adhere to ‘less can be more’ in other places as
well, by removing unnecessary variables, unnecessary concepts, and
unnecessary definitions. It does you credit if you want to explain
<em>everything</em> about a certain field in your paper, but if you introduce
a concept X as a special case of a concept Y, there is no need to go to
great lengths to describe any super-concept Z, unless you actually
<em>need</em> to refer to its properties. This does not mean that you should
leave out salient information—I am suggesting to <em>focus</em> on pertinent
information only. For example, there is no need to expand on properties
of metric spaces, topologies, and so on, if all you need is Lipschitz
continuity. Aim to get to the point quickly and without too many
redirections&nbsp;(unless you are writing a book, but I am assuming that
the reader of this post is interested in writing research papers).</p>
<p>Try also not to fall prey to the tendency to make your formulas more
complex than they have to be. For example, peppering your formulas with
logical quantifiers such as $\forall$ or $\exists$ is more appropriate
when you are publishing in logic. Many people, however, treat these
symbols as shortcuts. Please <em>do</em> resist that temptation. As Knuth
remarks in <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf">Mathematical Writing</a>,
the overuse of such symbols just decreases readability.</p>
<p>As a corollary to the preceding rule, do <em>not</em> include ‘cosmetic
mathematics’ in your paper.  Every equation, lemma, proposition, or
theorem should be there because it needs to be there. I know that there
is a tendency for reviewers to look favourably on a paper whose
mathematics seem ‘sufficiently complex’, but this is not the right way.
If you want to publish good papers, your first duty is to ensure that
readers of that paper can glean some insights from it. Showing off will
not help in the long run.</p>

<p>Similar to my previous post <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/on_writing/">on writing in general</a>,
the main thing to remember is to know your audience. In machine
learning, this audience can come from highly different backgrounds. Make
them appreciate the ideas in your paper by guiding them gently into the
mathematics. Reserve the ‘heavy stuff’ for an expert audience that can
give you some actual feedback for it instead of just skimming over it.</p>
<p>Write well, until next time!</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I am assuming throughout this article that your research article
is written for a machine learning conference. You might have to adjust
your writing considerably if you are a mathematician publishing for
other mathematicians—but in machine learning, many people are not
exclusively trained in mathematics, making writing research papers
a little bit more challenging if you want to do it well. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Whether proofs should be included in machine learning papers at
all is still a matter of debate. I think that a rigorous, principled
exposition in a paper is to be welcomed. Yet, the more our community
expands, the more we have to think about how to successfully get the
point across in our papers! At some point, there will not be
a sufficient number of expert reviewers for highly specific papers,
I fear. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              
              <article><p>I despise remote <em>desktop</em> access. The way it breaks keybindings is something that messes with my muscle memory pretty badly. That’s why I ended up working on Bazel’s macOS port at Google: I wanted to expand the ability to develop on Macs natively instead of relying on remote Linux workstations. But I now have to use remote Windows VMs for Azure development because that’s the way it is, so I’ll have to cope. Or will I?</p>
<p>As surprising as it may sound, recent versions of Windows ship with OpenSSH and, combined with PowerShell, it should be possible to operate a remote machine without the need for a graphical interface. (Except for editing files. I don’t understand how there is no built-in text-based editor. Bring back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor"><code>EDIT.COM</code></a>!)</p>
<p>Furthermore, it seems like I’m free to choose any development environment I want (unlike at Google, where there were only a few blessed ways to operate) and some of my new teammates use VSCode. And this is a good thing because VSCode has excellent remote development abilities—<em>including</em> debugging—by means of a trivial SSH connection. Thus I want to see how far I can get by with using VSCode and a terminal, both connected to the remote VM via SSH.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, setting up SSH with key-based authentication wasn’t trivial. I spent about an hour figuring things out, in part because the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_overview">official documentation</a> is broken, and in part because all the “fixes” I found online in arbitrary forums were as misleading as you can imagine.</p>
<p>You can consider these to be my lab notes to get my Windows 10 laptop (build 19041) to connect to my VM on a Windows Server 2019 machine using SSH with key-based authentication. I’m sure I’ll need these in the future again.</p>

<p>Setting up the server was easy. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse">instructions</a> worked without a problem and I could redirect you to them, but I’m reproducing them here for completeness:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install the SSH server optional feature by querying the exact package name and then installing it. Make sure to use the correct version printed in your case:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-WindowsCapability</span> <span>-Online</span> <span>|</span> <span>?</span> <span>Name</span> <span>-like</span> <span>'OpenSSH.Server*'</span>
<span>Add-WindowsCapability</span> <span>-Online</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>'OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0'</span>
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Start the <code>sshd</code> service and make sure it’s always available by configuring it as automatic:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Start-Service</span> <span>sshd</span>
<span>Set-Service</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>sshd</span> <span>-StartupType</span> <span>'Automatic'</span>
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Confirm that the firewall rule to allow inbound SSH access on port 22 is configured. If not, configure it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-NetFirewallRule</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>*</span><span>ssh</span><span>*</span>
<span>New-NetFirewallRule</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>sshd</span> <span>-DisplayName</span> <span>'OpenSSH Server (sshd)'</span> <span>-Enabled</span> <span>True</span> <span>-Direction</span> <span>Inbound</span> <span>-Protocol</span> <span>TCP</span> <span>-Action</span> <span>Allow</span> <span>-LocalPort</span> <span>22</span>
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p><em>(Optional, but really, why put yourself through <code>cmd.exe</code>.)</em> Set PowerShell as the default shell:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>New-ItemProperty</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>"HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH"</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>DefaultShell</span> <span>-Value</span> <span>"C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"</span> <span>-PropertyType</span> <span>String</span> <span>-Force</span>
</code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<p>So far so good. These straightforward instructions should allow inbound SSH connections to the Windows Server to work. You can probably do most of the above from the UI too if that’s your game, but I’m trying to figure out CLI-based administration as I go.</p>

<p>Install the SSH client optional feature by querying the exact package name and then installing it. Make sure to use the correct version printed in your case:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-WindowsCapability</span> <span>-Online</span> <span>|</span> <span>?</span> <span>Name</span> <span>-like</span> <span>'OpenSSH.Client*'</span>
<span>Add-WindowsCapability</span> <span>-Online</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>'OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can do this from the UI as well via the <em>Optional features</em> control panel and selecting <em>OpenSSH Client</em>.</p>
<p>But that’s it. There is no step two.</p>

<p>This is where things get tricky because <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement">the official documentation</a> is wrong. You see, the official documents talk about installing the <code>OpenSSHUtils</code> package… but that package seems to be gone. And before you think that this is my fault for not knowing how Windows works yet (which, hey, it was my assumption too)… there are <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windowsserverdocs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+OpenSSHUtils">plenty of months-old issues</a> in the bug tracker describing this problem and I can’t understand how it hasn’t been fixed yet.</p>
<p>So, how do we get the SSH agent installed? We don’t: it’s already there (as part of the <em>OpenSSH Client</em> package, I suppose).</p>
<p>The problem is that, even after knowing that the agent is installed, enabling it as the instructions say doesn’t work:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">PS C:\&gt; Start-Service ssh-agent
Start-Service : Service 'OpenSSH Authentication Agent (ssh-agent)' cannot be started due to the following error:
Cannot start service ssh-agent on computer '.'.
At line:1 char:1
+ Start-Service ssh-agent
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : OpenError: (System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController:ServiceController) [Start-Service], ServiceCommandException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CouldNotStartService,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.StartServiceCommand
</code></pre></div><p>This is a very helpful (not) error message: OK, the service cannot be started. But… why? No information. Seeing this error and the request to install the <code>OpenSSHUtils</code> package made me assume that the service was missing. But it wasn’t as I already mentioned above. Then, how come the start request failed? Well, the service’s status defaults to <strong>Disabled</strong> and thus requests to start it fail. To fix:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Set-Service</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>ssh-agent</span> <span>-StartupType</span> <span>'Automatic'</span>
<span>Start-Service</span> <span>ssh-agent</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Alright. One fewer problem. With this, <code>ssh-add</code> started working as expected.</p>

<p>But there was one more problem. No matter what I did, the server would not accept my key: it would always fall back to password-based authentication even after the client correctly offered the key during connection establishment. A lot of the online “tips” talk about setting the right ACLs on the <code>%UserProfile%\.ssh\authorized_keys</code> file to ensure they are restrictive enough, and I sank a ton of time down this path without success.</p>
<p>My next guess was that key authentication was disabled for some super-strange reason, but I had to confirm this. I spent quite a while trying to find where the <code>sshd_config</code> file lived: I couldn’t guess its location from the documentation, and recursively searching through the contents of <code>C:\</code> didn’t yield any results. Strange. “Maybe <code>sshd</code> has been patched to assume certain defaults so that there isn’t a need for an <code>sshd_config</code> file”, I thought.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until later that I found a random blog post with a clue: if your (remote) account happens to have administrator privileges (and mine does)… then the public key has to be placed in the special location <code>%ProgramData%\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys</code>, <strong>not</strong> under your personal <code>%UserProfile%\.ssh\authorized_keys</code> file. Wonderful, because the documentation had no mention of this.</p>
<p>OK! Let’s try that then. I went to create this file, but was greeted by:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">PS C:\&gt; mkdir ProgramData
mkdir : An item with the specified name C:\ProgramData already exists.
At line:1 char:1
+ mkdir ProgramData
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ResourceExists: (C:\ProgramData:String) [New-Item], IOException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DirectoryExist,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.NewItemCommand
</code></pre></div><p>Wait, what? The call to create the directory failed because the directory <em>did</em> exist? I certainly had not seen it earlier when looking directly at <code>C:\</code>. Alright, so… what’s inside?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">PS C:\&gt; cd ProgramData
PS C:\ProgramData&gt; ls


    Directory: C:\ProgramData


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
... 🥁🥁🥁 ...
d-----        2020-05-10     22:43                ssh
...
</code></pre></div><p>Ta-da! The promised <code>ssh</code> directory. And guess what was within it? The <code>sshd_config</code> file I had been looking for earlier (which, by the way, confirmed the need to put administrator credentials into the <code>administrators_authorized_keys</code> special file).</p>
<p>This is when things clicked and explains why I hadn’t reached this point much earlier. Hidden files. I had forgotten about those. The <code>C:\ProgramData\</code> directory is hidden by default, and that’s why none of my earlier file searches had encountered the <code>sshd_config</code> file.</p>
<p>But wait! The <code>administrators_authorized_keys</code> file doesn’t exist by default, and if you create it without giving it a second thought, things won’t work: <code>sshd</code> for Windows expects obnoxiously specific permissions and, if they are wrong, silently ignores the file. The permissions <strong>must</strong> grant <em>Full Access</em> to the <em>System</em> and the <em>Administrators</em> scopes alone. This is how the ACLs should look like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">PS C:\ProgramData\ssh&gt; icacls .\administrators_authorized_keys
.\administrators_authorized_keys NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(F)
                                 BUILTIN\Administrators:(F)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
</code></pre></div><p>And, with that, I was able to finally log in without having to type my password every single time 🙌.</p>

				<p>Such metrics widely used in analytic and monitoring tools like Graphana or Newrelic. Usually in context of response time. Lets look in each of them:</p><p>Average - arithmetic mean: sum up all values and divide this total number by number of elements.</p><p>Median (or p50) - sort all given values by value and pick halfway point. Lets say if we have p50 as 219ms it means that 50% of monitored requests for the given period were completed in 219ms or less.</p><p>P90 (or 90th percentile) - same as p50 but in this case it is 90% of requests. &nbsp;</p>

	<p>Fourier transforms are a tool used in a whole bunch of different things. This is an explanation of what a Fourier transform does, and some different ways it can be useful. And how you can make pretty things with it, like this thing:</p>
<canvas id="self-draw" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>I'm going to explain how that animation works, and along the way explain Fourier transforms!</p>
<p>By the end you should have a good idea about</p>
<ul>
<li>What a Fourier transform does</li>
<li>Some practical uses of Fourier transforms</li>
<li>Some pointless but cool uses of Fourier transforms</li>
</ul>
<p>We're going to leave the mathematics and equations out of it for now. There's a bunch of interesting maths behind it, but it's better to start with what it actually does, and why you'd want to use it first. If you want to know more about the how, there's some further reading suggestions below!</p>
<h2 id="sowhatisthisthing">So what is this thing?</h2>
<p>Put simply, the Fourier transform is a way of splitting something up into a bunch of sine waves. As usual, the name comes from some person who lived a long time ago called Fourier.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some simple examples and work our way up. First up we're going to look at waves - patterns that repeat over time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example wave:</p>
<canvas id="combo-sine-wave" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>This wavy pattern here can be split up into sine waves. That is, when we add up the two sine waves we get back the original wave.</p>
<canvas id="combo-sine-wave-split" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>The Fourier transform is a way for us to take the combined wave, and get each of the sine waves back out. In this example, you can almost do it in your head, just by looking at the original wave.</p>
<p>Why? Turns out a lot of things in the real world interact based on these sine waves. We usually call them the wave's frequencies.</p>
<p>The most obvious example is sound – when we hear a sound, we don’t hear that squiggly line, but we hear the different frequencies of the sine waves that make up the sound.</p>



<p>Being able to split them up on a computer can give us an understanding of what a person actually hears. We can understand how high or low a sound is, or figure out what note it is.</p>
<p>We can also use this process on waves that don't look like they're made of sine waves.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at this guy. It’s called a square wave.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>It might not look like it, but it also can be split up into sine waves.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave-split" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>We need a lot of them this time – technically an infinite amount to perfectly represent it. As we add up more and more sine waves the pattern gets closer and closer to the square wave we started with.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave-build-up" width="500" height="500"></canvas>


<p><em>Drag the slider above to play with how many sine waves there are.</em></p>
<p>Visually, you'll notice that actually the first few sine waves are the ones that make the biggest difference. With the slider halfway, we have the general shape of the wave, but it's all wiggly. We just need the rest of the small ones to make the wigglyness flatten out.</p>
<p>When you listen to the wave, you'll hear the sound get lower, because we're removing the higher frequencies.</p>
<p>This process works like that for any repeating line. Give it a go, try drawing your own!</p>


<p><em>Move the slider to see how as we add more sine waves, it gets closer and closer to your drawing</em></p>
<p>Again, aside from the extra wigglyness, the wave looks pretty similar with just half of the sine waves.</p>
<p>We can actually use the fact that the wave is pretty similar to our advantage. By using a Fourier transform, we can get the important parts of a sound, and only store those to end up with something that's pretty close to the original sound.</p>
<p>Normally on a computer we store a wave as a series of points.</p>
<canvas id="wave-samples" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>What we can do instead is represent it as a bunch of sine waves. Then we can compress the sound by ignoring the smaller frequencies. Our end result won't be the same, but it'll sound pretty similar to a person.</p>
<canvas id="wave-frequencies" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>This is essentially what MP3s do, except they're more clever about which frequencies they keep and which ones they throw away.</p>
<p>So in this case, we can use Fourier transforms to get an understanding of the fundamental properties of a wave, and then we can use that for things like compression.</p>
<p>Ok, now let's dig more into the Fourier transform. This next part looks cool, but also gives you a bit more understanding of what the Fourier transform does. But mostly looks cool.</p>
<h2 id="epicycles">Epicycles</h2>
<p>Now at the start, I said it splits things into sine waves. The thing is, the sine waves it creates are not just regular sine waves, but they’re 3D. You could call them "complex sinusoids". Or just "spirals".</p>
<canvas id="complex-sinusoid" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>If we take a look from the side, they look like sine waves. From front on, though, these look like circles.</p>
<canvas id="complex-sinusoid-turn" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>So far everything we’ve been doing has only required the regular 2D sine waves. When we do a Fourier transform on 2D waves, the complex parts cancel out so we just end up with sine waves.</p>
<p>But we can use the 3D sine waves to make something fun looking like this:</p>
<canvas id="peace-epicycles" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>What’s going on here?</p>
<p>Well, we can think of the drawing as a 3D shape because of the way it moves around in time. If you imagine the hand being drawn by a person, the three dimensions represent where the tip of their pencil is at that moment. The x and y dimensions tell us the position, and then the time dimension is the time at that moment.</p>
<canvas id="peace-3d" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>Now that we have a 3D pattern, we can't use the regular 2D sine waves to represent it. No matter how many of the 2D sine waves we add up, we'll never get something 3D. So we need something else.</p>
<p>What we can use is the 3D spiral sine waves from before. If we add up lots of those, we can get something that looks like our 3D pattern.</p>
<p>Remember, these waves look like circles when we look at them from front on. The name for the pattern of a circle moving around another circle is an epicycle.</p>
<canvas id="peace-build-up" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

<p><em>Use the slider above to control how many circles there are.</em></p>
<p>Like before, we get a pretty good approximation of our pattern with just a few circles. Because this is a fairly simple shape, all the last ones do is make the edges a little sharper.</p>
<p>All this applies to any drawing, really! Now it’s your chance to play around with it.</p>


<p><em>Use the slider to control how many circles are used for your drawing</em></p>
<p>Again, you'll see for most shapes, we can approximate them fairly well with just a small number of circles, instead of saving all the points.</p>
<p>Can we use this for real data? Well, we could! In reality we have another data format called SVG, which probably does a better job for the types of shapes we tend to create. So for the moment, this is really just for making cool little gifs.</p>
<canvas id="fourier-title" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>There is another type of visual data that does use Fourier transforms, however.</p>
<h2 id="jpegs">JPEGs</h2>
<p>Did you know Fourier transforms can also be used on images? In fact, we use it all the time, because that's how JPEGs work! We're applying the same principles to images – splitting up something into a bunch of sine waves, and then only storing the important ones.</p>
<p>Now we're dealing with images, we need a different type of sine wave. We need to have something that no matter what image we have, we can add up a bunch of these sine waves to get back to our original image.</p>
<p>To do that, each of our sine waves will be images too. Instead of a wave that's a line, we now have images with black and white sections. To represent the size of a wave, each image will have more or less contrast.</p>
<p>We can also use these to represent color in the same way, but let's start with black-and-white images for now. To represent colorless images, we need some horizontal wave images,</p>
<p><img id="img-y-component" src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/components-4-0.png"></p>
<p>Along with some vertical wave images.</p>
<p><img id="img-x-component" src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/components-0-4.png"></p>
<p>By themselves, just horizontal and vertical images aren't enough to represent the types of images we get. We also need some extra ones that you get by multiplying the two together.</p>

<p>For an 8x8 image, here are all the images we need.</p>

<p>If we take the images, adjust their contrast to the right amount, and then add them up we can create any image.</p>
<p>Let's start with this letter 'A'. It's pretty small, but we need it to be small otherwise we'll end up with too many other images.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/a.png"></p>
<p>As we add more and more of these images, we end up with something that becomes closer and closer to the actual image. But I think you'll see the pattern here, as we get a reasonable approximation with just a few of them.</p>

<p>For actual JPEG images there are just a few extra details.</p>
<p>The image gets broken up into 8x8 chunks, and each chunk gets split up separately. We use a set of frequencies to determine how light or dark each pixel is, and then another two sets for the color, one for red-green, and another for blue-yellow. The number of frequencies that we use for each chunk determines the quality of the JPEG.</p>
<p>Here's a real JPEG image, zoomed in so we can see the details. When we play with the quality levels we can see this process happen.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So let's recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fourier transforms are things that let us take something and split it up into its frequencies.</li>
<li>The frequencies tell us about some fundamental properties of the data we have</li>
<li>And can compress data by only storing the important frequencies</li>
<li>And we can also use them to make cool looking animations with a bunch of circles</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just scratching the surface into some applications. The Fourier transform is an extremely powerful tool, because splitting things up into frequencies is so fundamental. They're used in a lot of fields, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Apple’s launch of macOS Big Sur was almost immediately followed by server issues which prevented users from running third-party apps on their computers. While a workaround was soon found by people on Twitter, others raised some privacy concerns related to that issue.</p>
<center><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey Apple users:</p><p>If you're now experiencing hangs launching apps on the Mac, I figured out the problem using Little Snitch.</p><p>It's trustd connecting to <a href="https://t.co/FzIGwbGRan">https://t.co/FzIGwbGRan</a></p><p>Denying that connection fixes it, because OCSP is a soft failure.</p><p>(Disconnect internet also fixes.) <a href="https://t.co/w9YciFltrb">pic.twitter.com/w9YciFltrb</a></p></div>— Jeff Johnson (@lapcatsoftware) <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1326990296412991489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2020</a></blockquote></center> 
<h2 id="what-is-ocsp">What is OCSP?</h2>
<p>OCSP stands for Online Certificate Status Protocol<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. As the name implies, it is used to verify the validity of a certificate without having to download and scan large certificate revocation lists. macOS uses OCSP to make sure that the developer certificate <strong>hasn’t been revoked</strong> before an app is launched.</p>
<p>As Jeff Johnson explains in his tweet above, if macOS cannot reach Apple’s OCSP responder it skips the check and launches the app anyway - it is basically a fail-open behaviour. The problem is that Apple’s responder didn’t go down; it was reachable but became extremely slow, and this prevented the soft failure from triggering and giving up the check.</p>
<p>It is clear that this mechanism requires macOS to <strong>contact Apple</strong> before an app is launched. The sudden public awareness of this fact, brought about by Apple’s issues, raised some privacy concerns and a post from security researcher <strong>Jeffrey Paul</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> became very popular on Twitter. He claims that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the current version of the macOS, the OS sends to Apple a hash (unique identifier) of each and every program you run, when you run it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would be creepy indeed.</p>
<p>To make things worse, it is common for OCSP to use HTTP - I’m talking about <em>good old <strong>plaintext HTTP</strong> on port 80, none of that HTTPS rubbish</em>. There is usually a good reason for this, that becomes especially clear when the OCSP service is used for web browsers: preventing loops. If you used HTTPS for checking a certificate with OCSP then you would need to also check the certificate for the HTTPS connection using OCSP. That would imply opening another HTTPS connection and so on.</p>
<p>Of course while OCSP does not mandate encryption, it does require that responses are signed by the server. This still doesn’t solve the initial concern that anyone with a traffic analyzer on your network could eavesdrop every app you open and when you open it.</p>
<h2 id="diving-deeper">Diving deeper</h2>
<p>Knowing some OCSP basics, more questions arise. OCSP is about checking certificates; why should this have anything to do with sending out <em><strong>hashes</strong></em> of apps you run? Does macOS really compute the hash of each executable at each launch? What about very large ones? That would take a significant amount of time; is it possible that nobody noticed? Maybe the hash is computed only once (e.g. the first time you run the app) and it is stored somewhere. But I’m not convinced and I think these claims needs more research.</p>
<p>Capturing a OCSP request is as easy as setting up an HTTP proxy or starting Wireshark. No HTTPS means no encryption, no certificate pinning, no problems whatsoever. I captured the following request while opening Firefox.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>GET</span> <span>/ocsp-devid01/ME4wTKADAgEAMEUwQzBBMAkGBSsOAwIaBQAEFDOB0e%2FbaLCFIU0u76%2BMSmlkPCpsBBRXF%2B2iz9x8mKEQ4Py%2Bhy0s8uMXVAIIBseUIWx6qTA%3D</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>ocsp.apple.com</span>
<span>Accept</span><span>:</span> <span>*/*</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>com.apple.trustd/2.0</span>
<span>Accept-Language</span><span>:</span> <span>it-it</span>
<span>Accept-Encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>gzip, deflate</span>
<span>Connection</span><span>:</span> <span>keep-alive</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I should also add that after closing Firefox and opening it again, no requests were made. This is reasonable, and indicates that certificate checking isn’t performed at each launch but only after it hasn’t been performed for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>The request is a very simple GET that contains the payload as a base64-encoded string. The actual binary data can be easily dumped to a file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> <span>'ME4wTKADAgEAMEUwQzBBMAkGBSsOAwIaBQAEFDOB0e/baLCFIU0u76+MSmlkPCpsBBRXF+2iz9x8mKEQ4Py+hy0s8uMXVAIIBseUIWx6qTA='</span> <span>|</span> base64 --decode &gt; output.bin
</code></pre></div><p>We obtain an 80-byte-long payload that looks nothing like a hash. Sure enough, it isn’t. We can use OpenSSL to extract readable information from the binary file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">openssl ocsp -text -reqin output.bin
</code></pre></div><pre><code>OCSP Request Data:
    Version: 1 (0x0)
    Requestor List:
        Certificate ID:
          Hash Algorithm: sha1
          Issuer Name Hash: 3381D1EFDB68B085214D2EEFAF8C4A69643C2A6C

          Serial Number: 06C794216C7AA930
</code></pre><p>It is clear that the <code>trustd</code> service on macOS doesn’t send out a hash of the apps you launch. Instead, it just sends information about some certificate - as we would certainly expect after understanding what OCSP is in the first place.</p>
<p>Well, this does not solve the problem, does it? If each app has a unique certificate, then it would still be possible to create a table that associates each serial number to the corresponding app, and thus this would still be a privacy concern. Let’s check if this is the case.</p>
<h2 id="developer-certificates">Developer certificates…</h2>
<p>First of all I would like to determine from which certificate this information comes from. I used Apple’s <code>codesign</code> utility to extract certificates from the Firefox app in order to look for matching data.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">codesign -d --extract-certificates /Applications/Firefox.app
</code></pre></div><p>This command results in several files being created with names <code>codesign0</code>, <code>codesign1</code>, etc. The first one is the leaf certificate, while others belong to the certificate chain up until the root. <code>codesign0</code> should be what we are looking for, and once again we can use OpenSSL to extract some info about it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">openssl x509 -inform der -in codesign0 -text
</code></pre></div><pre><code>Certificate:

<h2 id="and-their-generality">…and their generality</h2>
<p>“So what?” you might ask. Well, developer certificates aren’t unique for each app. Once again, don’t take my word for it. We can quickly verify this by checking the certificate of a different app from Mozilla, say Thunderbird.</p>

</code></pre><p>That’s exactly the same certificate used for Firefox (of course it is!). So Jeffrey Paul’s analysis isn’t quite accurate - at least for what concerns these parts (emphasis mine).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The OS sends to Apple a hash (unique identifier) of each and every program you run, when you run it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[An IP address]&nbsp;allows for a table that has the following headings:
Date, Time, Computer, ISP, City, State, <strong>Application Hash</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[This means that Apple knows] what apps you open there, and how often. They know when you open Premiere over at a friend’s house on their Wi-Fi, and they know when you open Tor Browser in a hotel on a trip to another city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>macOS does actually send out some opaque information about <strong>the developer</strong> certificate of those apps, and that’s quite an important difference on a privacy perspective.</p>
<h2 id="a-word-about-notarization">A word about notarization</h2>
<p>I would like to clarify something that is probably at the root of this misunderstanding. In fact, there exists a situation where macOS can actually send Apple the hash of an executable, and that is when <strong>Gatekeeper</strong> checks if a notarization ticket exists on Apple’s servers upon first launch, in case the ticket isn’t stapled to the app<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with OCSP. It happens under specific circumstances and the check is performed via a secure (HTTPS) endpoint located at <code>api.apple-cloudkit.com</code>. During this process, a pop-up with a progress bar is shown to the user.</p>
<h2 id="about-blocking-ocsp">About blocking OCSP</h2>
<p>As you probably have already learned during Apple’s OCSP responder outage, you can block OCSP requests in several ways, the most popular ones being Little Snitch<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and editing your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. Personally, I wouldn’t suggest doing that as it prevents an <strong>important security feature</strong> from working.</p>
<p>Now that you know the actual facts, if you think your privacy is put at risk by this feature more than having potential undetected malware running on your system, go ahead. Otherwise, don’t bother.</p>
<p>If you use macOS Big Sur, blocking OCSP might not be as trivial. Before crying conspiracy, however, keep in mind that common users are generally not able to fully understand and evaluate the impact of disabling such a complex and delicate security feature on their computer.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>No, macOS <strong>does not</strong> send Apple a hash of your apps each time you run them.</li>
<li>You should be aware that macOS <strong>might transmit</strong> some opaque information about the developer certificate of the apps you run. This information is sent out in clear text on your network.</li>
<li><strong>You shouldn’t</strong> probably block <code>ocsp.apple.com</code> with Little Snitch or in your hosts file.</li>

So when people are visiting or linking to domains owned by a specific person or company, they expect to link to a specific author's work. If that authorship changes, the link is no longer relevant.</p><p>I have this issue with my old domain. I want to get rid of it, but nothing's stopping someone from buying it and serving ads or malicious content. Even after two years, people still use it; linked from other websites and their bookmarks. Even with a redirect page asking them to switch over, those links will never change. There's nothing I can do about it. In a few years, I'll just have to accept it might lead people to malicious websites, unrelated pages, or a dead end. All of which can be annoying when you're browsing the web.</p><h2>So, what's the solution?</h2><p>A somewhat naive approach is to include a signature alongside every page and have links include a public key reference. The browser can then verify the linked page is still authored by whoever the link expects.

November 14, 2020 | https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/type-hints-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/type-hints-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>In the low-level programming languages like Java, C, C++, and C#, <span>variables are strictly typed</span> - which means you have to indicate the variable type when creating a variable.</p>

<p>For example, creating variables in <strong>Java</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>String name = "John";       

int age;                    # only an integer can be assigned to age

age = 23;                   # assigning a value to age</code></pre>



<p>Unlike Java, <span>Python gives us the flexibility to declare and assign variables without specifying their types</span> :</p>

<pre><code>name = "John"

age = 23</code></pre>

<p>In this type of coding, Python <span>automatically figures out the type of data that has been assigned to a variable</span>. You can verify that by using the <code>type()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>print(type(name))              # &lt;class 'str'&gt;
print(type(age))               # &lt;class 'int'&gt;</code></pre>



<h2>Type Hints in Python</h2>

<p>Though <span>Python is not a strictly typed language</span>, you can still <span>give a hint of a variable's data type</span>.</p>

<p>To specify a variable type when declaring it,</p>

<p><code>variable_name: variable_type = value</code></p>

<pre><code>weather: str = "cloudy"

degrees: int                    # you can declare a variable before assigning
degrees = 32</code></pre>



<p>Also note that even <span>after a variable type is indicated in Python, you can still assign a different data type to the variable</span>:</p>

<pre><code>degrees: int = 32
print(degrees)                      # 32

degrees = "thirty-two"
print(degrees)                      # thirty-two</code></pre>



<p>Specifying a variable type in Python does not mean the variable can only accept values of that type. They are just hints that inform a user of the type which a variable is.</p>



<h2>Adding types to functions</h2>

<p>Type hints are very useful in Functions,&nbsp; mostly when declaring function parameters.</p>

<p>For example, here is a <span>simple function that takes in two arguments and returns the sum</span>.</p>

<pre><code>def sum(a, b):
    return a + b</code></pre>

<p>By looking at this code, <span>one cannot be sure if the caller is going to supply integers</span> as the argument or <span>strings</span> or any other data type.</p>

<p>A call to this function works when supplied with <span>int</span> values and with other values such as <span>strings, lists, and tuples</span>:</p>

<pre><code>sum(3, 5)                               # 8

sum([1, 0, 5], ['java', 'c++'])         # [1, 0, 5, 'java', 'c++']

sum('2', '3')                           # 23</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see that the<code> sum()</code> function works well when it is invoked with either <span>int</span> values, <span>string</span> values, or <span>even</span> lists.</p>

<p>But the goal of the <code>sum()</code> function is to<span> add two integers</span>, and not two <span>lists </span>or <span>strings</span>. We can now provide type hints for the parameters in the Function definition indicating the type that we want to allow.</p>

<p>To indicate that we only want to allow <span>int types</span> we can change our function definition to look like:</p>

<pre><code>def sum(a: int, b: int):
    return a + b</code></pre>

<p>This informs the function caller that <span>the arguments required for the sum() function </span>should be<span> integers </span>not otherwise.</p>

<p>Similarly, <span>to indicate only <code>str </code>types are allowed</span>, we'd change our function to specify it as:</p>

<pre><code>def sum(a: str, b: str):
    return a + b</code></pre>



<h2>Specifying A function's return type.</h2>

<p>One could also indicate the return value of a function call :</p>

<pre><code>def sum(number1, number2) -&gt; int :
    return number1 + number1</code></pre>

<p>This informs the caller that the return type of the <code>sum()</code> function should be an integer.</p>

<h3><i>How to lose weight and hair through stress and poor nutrition</i></h3>
<address>
By
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/" target="_top">John Walker</a>
</address>
</center>

<p>

<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite>, notwithstanding its silly
subtitle, is a serious book about how to lose weight and
permanently maintain whatever weight you desire.  It
treats dieting and weight control from an <em>engineering</em>
and <em>management</em> standpoint, and provides the tools
and an understanding of why they work and how to use
them that permit the reader to gain control of their
own weight.  The book is intended primarily for busy,
successful engineers, programmers, and managers who
have struggled unsuccessfully in the past to lose
weight and avoid re-gaining it.
<a href="#Comptools">Computer-based tools</a>
and experiments in Microsoft Excel or the Palm Computing
Platform are available, as well as an online Web application,
but a computer is not necessary to use
the techniques described in the book; paper and pencil
alternatives are provided.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Fourth Edition (2005)</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/figures/hdpage4.png" width="256" height="288" alt=""></a>
The Fourth Edition of <cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was
released in November 2005.  It is essentially identical in content with the
previous editions, but has been extensively re-formatted to improve
appearance, accessibility, ease of navigation, and standards compliance.
The Fourth Edition strictly complies with the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">XHTML&nbsp;1.0</a> (Transitional and Frameset)
and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">CSS&nbsp;2.1</a>
standards and requires a browser which implements these
standards.  (As of the release of this edition, current versions
of all of the most popular browsers, including Mozilla Firefox,
Opera, and Microsoft Internet Explorer supported these standards
sufficiently to display the book without problems.)  In addition, the
browser and operating system must display Unicode character entities.
JavaScript and DOM/DHTML are used in the navigation bar, but if they're
absent or disabled, everything will still work.  If your browser and/or
system cannot handle this version, the Third Edition (Frames) or the
No-Frame editions, both of which date from 1994, will almost certainly
work.  The content is the same; only the presentation is more rudimentary.
<br clear="right">
</p>

<h2><a name="epub" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub">EPUB Edition (2011)</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/figures/hd_ipad_256.png" width="198" height="288" alt=""></a>
The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUB</a>
edition is in the open document format
compatible with the iBooks application on the Apple iPad, iPhone, and
iPod&nbsp;touch; Sony Reader; Barnes and Noble Nook; and a variety of
other electronic book devices and mobile platforms.  EPUB books may be
opened directly with a Web browser using the
<a href="http://www.epubread.com/en/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUBReader</a>
add-on for Firefox or the
<a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/15552/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">eBook
Reader</a>
widget for Opera, although users of desktop and notebook computers
with Internet connectivity will probably prefer the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Web edition</a>,
due to its more flexible navigation options.
</p>

<p>
If your Web browser has an EPUB-compatible plug-in installed, you can
open the book simply by clicking on the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub" target="Hackdiet_Aux"><cite>The
Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB Edition</a>
link.  Otherwise, use your browser's idiom to download the
abovementioned file to your computer and then transfer it to your
reading device according to the manufacturer's directions.  For the
iPad and iPhone (etc.), just drag the downloaded
<tt>hackdiet.epub</tt> file to iTunes, where you should see it in the
“Books” section.  Then connect your reading device to the
computer and the book should be transferred to it by the Sync
process.  If the book is not installed, make sure that you've enabled
syncing books to that device, and that if you've opted not to sync all
books in your library to the device, that <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> is checked to be copied.  You must also, of course, have
the Apple
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBooks" target="Hackdiet_Aux">iBooks</a>
application installed on the device; if it's missing, go to the App
Store and install it—it's free.
</p>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB edition contains no “Digital
Rights Management” constraints: you are free to install it on as
many devices as you wish, transfer it among them (if their hardware
and software so permit), and pass on copies to others.  It should be
compatible with any EPUB reader hardware and software which can open
standards-compliant unrestricted files.

If you prefer to read the book off-line, you can
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdpdf.zip">download a PDF edition</a> (1.3 Mb, ZIP compressed)
which you
can read with the Adobe Reader utility,

free of charge</a> directly from the
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">Adobe Systems</a> Web site.
The PDF edition preserves all the formatting of
the original book, and permits point-and-click navigation
among chapters and to follow cross-references in the text.

<p>
Adobe is one of the most consistently irritating companies
on Earth with which to do business.  I'd like to give you
a nice button for downloading your own copy of Adobe Reader,
but they won't let me use the image without “registering”

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">PostScript Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was originally typeset
using <a href="http://www.tug.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">TeX</a> with the
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">LaTeX</a>
macro package.  Camera-ready copy was generated
from PostScript created by the <tt>dvips</tt>
utility.  The PostScript edition is a single monolithic
file, almost 2.7 megabytes, containing the
entire book as originally typeset.  You can read it on-line
with a PostScript viewing program such as
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">GhostScript</a>
(which is free), or print it on any PostScript-compatible
printer.  <strong>Before sending this
file to a printer, consider that the book is almost
250 pages long!</strong>  This is a <em>big</em> print
job, which will consume lots of paper, toner, and,
potentially, good will of any colleagues with whom
you share the printer.  The PostScript edition may be
downloaded as either a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">ZIPped archive</a>
or a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hackdiet.ps.gz"><b>gzip</b> compressed Unix <b>tar</b>
file</a>; both are 702 Kb in length and uncompress to a 2.7
Mb PostScript file.

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdietf.html">Third Edition (1994 Web Edition with Frames)</a></h2>

<p>
If your browser supports frames but isn't up to the demands
of the Fourth Edition, the original 1994 Web edition with
frames remains available.
It allows navigation with
a panel which lets you click chapter titles and go
directly to that chapter.  If, in addition, your browser
supports JavaScript, simply moving the mouse over a
footnote icon, like this one:
<a onmouseover="javascript:footOver(0);" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/f/0.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/i/foot.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="[Footnote]"></a>
will pop up a window containing the footnote.  Moving the
mouse over other footnotes displays them in the auxiliary window.
Browsers without JavaScript (or users who have disabled
JavaScript in their browsers) may display footnotes in
the main document window by clicking the footnote icon,
then use their browser's “Back” button to return to the
main text.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html">No-Frame Web Edition</a></h2>

Users with browsers which do not support frames, or those
who prefer a more linear presentation in a single
window, may access a no-frame edition of <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> with identical content to the frame-based book.
The no-frame edition includes the pop-up footnotes present
in the frame edition, but since few browsers which lack
frames are likely to support JavaScript, you can simply click
on the footnote icon to display it, then use the
“Back” button or keystroke to return to the text containing
the footnote.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h4>What is the demo doing?</h4>
        <p>Neural networks achieve superhuman performance in many areas, but they are easily fooled.</p>
        <p>In the demo above, we can force neural networks to predict anything we want. By adding nearly-invisible noise to an image, we turn "1"s into "9"s, "Stop" signs into "120 km/hr" signs, and dogs into hot dogs.</p>
        <p>These noisy images are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning#Specific_Attacks_Types">adversarial examples</a>. They break the integrity of machine learning systems, and the illusion of their superhuman performance.</p>

        <h4>Why does this matter?</h4>
        <p>Our world is becoming increasingly automated, yet these systems have strange failure modes.</p>
        <p>If machine learning systems are not properly defended, attackers could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Impersonate others in facial recognition systems</li>
          <li>Force autonomous vehicles to misrecognize street signs &amp; obstacles</li>
          <li>Bypass content moderation and spam filters in social networks</li>
          <li>Inject adversarial bytes into malware to bypass antivirus systems</li>
          <li>Digitally alter numbers on a check in a mobile banking app</li>
          <li>(and more)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Is this limited to image classification with neural networks?</h4>
        <p>No. Adversarial examples exist for almost every machine learning task: <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/code/audio_adversarial_examples">speech recognition</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07998.pdf">text classification</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313533">fraud detection</a>, <a href="https://www.ericswallace.com/imitation">machine translation</a>, <a href="https://adversarialpolicies.github.io/">reinforcement learning</a>, ....</p>
        <p>Moreover, all machine learning models (not just neural networks) are vulnerable. In fact, simpler models such as logistic regression are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">even more easily attacked</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally – beyond adversarial examples – there are many more adversarial attack vectors, including data poisoning, model backdooring, data extraction, and model stealing.</p>

        <h4>How do I defend against adversarial examples?</h4>
        <p>There are several proposed defenses, including adversarial training and admission control.</p>
        <p>However, no defense is universal and many have proven ineffective, so work with an expert to quantify your risks and invest in defenses appropriately.</p>
        <p>(What happens if someone can make your system predict anything they want?).</p>

        <h4>Where can I learn more?</h4>

        <p>In 2020, an MCU is much more than a hunk of silicon. Indeed, it comes with a
whole ecosystem including a BSP, integrated third-party libraries, tooling,
field application support,  and more.</p>

<p>As firmware engineers, we are often handed down an MCU selection as a fait
accompli. Cost concerns, peripheral, or pinout requirements often take precedent
over the SDK.</p>

<p>Yet we are allowed to have an opinion. So here for you today is my first post in
a new “comparing MCU SDKs” series.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, I download SDKs for 10 popular Cortex-M4 microcontrollers, and
evaluate how straightforward it is to get a simple example compiling. I include
some step by step instructions to get started, a rating out of 10, and a few
comments.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>It goes without saying that this is an opinion based on my own very specific
setup (MacOS, vim). Your mileage may vary!</p>

<h2 id="what-im-looking-for-in-a-chip-sdk">What I’m looking for in a chip SDK</h2>

<p>My ideal chip SDK provides a way to build and flash projects using tools of
my choosing. This seems like a low bar, but few meet it. Here are things chip
SDKs should <strong>not</strong> do.</p>

<h3 id="dont-choose-my-laptop-os-for-me">Don’t choose my laptop OS for me!</h3>

<p>I left Windows behind when I worked at Sun Microsystems, and I have not looked
back. Today, my daily driver is a MacBook Air.  Unfortunately, some chip vendors
require that you use their Windows-based tools to set up and build your projects.
Now that most compilers are cross-platform, there is no excuse for it.</p>

<h3 id="dont-choose-my-ide-for-me">Don’t choose my IDE for me!</h3>

<p>I’ve been using <code>vim</code> since college, and you can take it from my cold, dead
hands. I love <code>vim</code>! I have it configured just so. It’s lightweight, it’s fast,
and modal editing is the way to work (prove me wrong!). So you’ll understand my
dismay at the spate of Eclipse-based IDEs chip vendors want to foist upon me. I
want nothing to do with their boated, Java environments.</p>

<p>Instead of Eclipse-based IDE, I suggest SDKs provide Makefiles. <code>make</code> is the
lowest common denominator build system, and is well supported by many tools.
Bonus points for project files for IAR and Keil, since many of you like those
tools.</p>

<h3 id="do-include-some-examples">Do include some examples</h3>

<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a working code example is worth a
million. Give me one example of each of the main use cases for your MCU. Bonus
points if you give me an example for each peripheral.</p>

<h2 id="ten-popular-chip-sdks-ranked">Ten Popular Chip SDKs, Ranked</h2>

<h3 id="nordic-semi-nrf5-sdk---1010">Nordic Semi nRF5-SDK - 10/10</h3>

<p>Nordic semiconductor’s line of Cortex-M4 MCUs includes the nRF52810, nRF52810,
and nRF52840. All feature a 2.4GHz radio, which may deter you if all you want is
an MCU.</p>

<p>The nRF5-SDK (soon to be replaced by the equally excellent nRF-Connect-SDK), is
in my view the best chip SDK out there.</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ✅</li>
</ul>

<p>The nRF5 SDK does everything right. No registration, no install, no online
configurator. It even is distributed under a BSD license!</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-blinky-example">Compiling a Blinky example</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Download the nRF5 SDK from <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Software/nRF5-SDK/Download#infotabs" target="_blank">nRF5 SDK downloads - nordicsemi.com</a>
</li>
  <li>Unzip the resulting <code>DeviceDownload.zip</code> file</li>
  <li>Unzip the SDK archive contained within. In my case that’s <code>nRF5SDK1702d674dde.zip</code>
</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the example you are interested in. Examples are contained within the <code>example</code> folder. In my case, <code>examples/peripheral/blinky/pca10040/blank</code>.</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the build system folder of your choice, in my case <code>armgcc</code>
</li>
  <li>Build the example, in my case by invoking <code>GNU_INSTALL_ROOT= make</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This will generate a <code>bin</code>, <code>elf</code>, and <code>hex</code> file (among others) under <code>_build</code>.</p>

<h3 id="texas-instruments-tivaware---910">Texas Instruments TivaWare - 9/10</h3>

<p>The Tiva C series is the latest entry in Texas Instruments’s line of Cortex-M
microcontrollers.  I do not have a lot of experience with them, but they seem
like solid microcontrollers with a broad range of peripherals (including USB).</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-1">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ✅</li>
</ul>

<p>Like Nordic, Texas Instruments gets a lot right: single-zip download, multi-IDE
support (including Makefiles), and lots of examples. I knocked off a point for
the wonky <code>exe</code> file (see below) and the more complicated license.</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-blinky-example-1">Compiling a Blinky example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Download TiWare SDK from <a href="https://www.ti.com/tool/download/SW-TM4C" target="_blank">SW-TM4C_2.2.0.295, TI.com</a>
</li>
  <li>Rename the downloaded file from <code>exe</code> to <code>zip</code>
</li>
  <li>Unzip it</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the example you are interested in. In my case <code>examples/boards/dk-tm4c129x/blinky</code>.</li>
  <li>Run <code>make</code>, or open the IDE-specific folder of your choice.</li>
</ol>

<p>You’ll be left with an <code>axf</code> (aka an ELF) and a <code>bin</code>  file in the <code>gcc</code> folder.</p>

<h3 id="nxp-mcuxpresso---910">NXP MCUXpresso - 9/10</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/best-and-worst-mcu-sdks/E2992448-AC4D-4A31-9B86-E4806F729E51.png" alt=""></p>

<p>NXP Kinetis traces its lineage to Motorola via Freescale. It is one of two
Cortex-M lines from NXP (the other being the LPC).  Like many MCU vendors, NXP
generates their SDK via a configurator and provides an Eclipse-based IDE, both
under the “MCUXpresso” brand.</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-2">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ⚠️</li>
</ul>

<p>I found the online MCUXpresso SDK builder a breeze to use. It is snappy,
straightforward, and it keeps track of all your previously configured SDKs.
Great job, NXP! The only downside of the tool is that it requires you to
register on their website.</p>

<p>I still have a preference for the monolithic SDK with all examples and targets
in one place, but you could argue that this generates a smaller, more
streamlined SDK.</p>

<p>Best of all, the SDK uses <code>cmake</code> to generate build files. <code>cmake</code> is arguably
more portable than <code>make</code>, as it is supported natively on Windows.</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-hello-world-example">Compiling a hello world example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the MCUXpresso SDK builder and create an account: <a href="https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/" target="_blank">MCUXpresso SDK Builder</a>
</li>
  <li>Once logged in, click on “Select Board” in the sidebar</li>
  <li>Enter the name of your MCU. In my case, a Kinetic K21</li>
  <li>Click on “Build MCUXpresso SDK” on the right</li>
  <li>Name your project, select a toolchain, and some third party software like FreeRTOS or mbedTLS.</li>
  <li>Click on “Download SDK” at the bottom</li>
  <li>After a bit, the SDK will be ready for download</li>
  <li>Unzip the SDK</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the example of your choice, in my case <code>boards/twrk21d50m/demo_apps/hello_world/</code>
</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to build system folder, in my case <code>armgcc</code>
</li>
  <li>Use the <code>build_debug.sh</code> build script and specify the<code>ARMGCC_DIR</code> environment variable:
e.g. <code>ARMGCC_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/arm-none-eabi-gcc/9-2019-q4-major sh build_debug.sh</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This will generate an ELF file.</p>

<h3 id="stm32-cube---810">STM32 Cube - 8/10</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/best-and-worst-mcu-sdks/6DA202F6-ED4E-4FFE-94B7-3A549D0F212F.png" alt=""></p>

<p>ST has gone through multiple iterations of the SDK for the STM32 family of ICs.
The latest is called STM32 Cube, which replaces the venerable Standard
Peripheral Library. While Cube introduces a lot of complexity, it does so for a
good reason: the STM32 family has grown to include 14 distinct series of MCUs
from the very low power L0 to the very high-performance H7.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Reader Nathan Jones <a href="https://community.memfault.com/t/the-best-and-worst-mcu-sdks-interrupt/294/12" target="_blank">pointed
out</a>
after the initial publication of this post that monolithic SDK downloads do
still exist for STM32. For example, <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-mpu-packages/stm32cubef1.html" target="_blank">here is the SDK for the
STM32F1</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-3">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ❌</li>
</ul>

<p>While Cube comes with support for many IDEs, and more examples than any other
MCU SDK, it wraps it all in a clunky desktop app. I had a terrible time using
STM32CubeMX: I had to install it on my laptop, it’s slow, it’s large, it’s
clunky. I do not like it.</p>

<p>STM32CubeMX generates a “project” directory based on your configuration. This
means that you won’t have all the example code in one folder, and instead will
need to generate different projects for different examples.</p>

<p>Necessary complexity? Perhaps. But I miss the simpler Peripheral Library which
came as a single archive.</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-hello-world-example-1">Compiling a Hello World example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download and install CubeMX: <a href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html" target="_blank">STM32CubeMX - STM32Cube initialization code generator - STMicroelectronics</a>. Note: this requires registration on ST’s website</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select “ACCESS TO MCU SELECTOR”</li>
  <li>Select the part you are using. In my case “STM32F429IE”</li>
  <li>In the Configuration view, click on the “Project Manager” tab</li>
  <li>Enter a project name, a path, and select a toolchain. In my case “Makefile”</li>
  <li>Click on “Generate Code” at the top right</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the generated project directory</li>
  <li>Compile the project with your build system. In my case with <code>make</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="atmel-start-for-samd---710">Atmel START for SAMD - 7/10</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/best-and-worst-mcu-sdks/83E37D9A-5975-4815-8937-437DA8675C0D.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Recently acquired by Microchip, Atmel has been making SAM-family MCUs for a long
time. The SAMD21 is well-liked in hobbyist circles and is featured in several
Arduino and Adafruit designs. Atmel’s peripheral library, AXF, went through a
similar transformation to ST’s: it went from a single zip archive to a
configurator.</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-4">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ❌</li>
</ul>

<p>Atmel’s configurator is web-based, and a tad more ergonomic than ST’s. However,
the resulting Makefiles are much worse and even feature a bug (I had to fix OS
detection).</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-hello-world-example-2">Compiling a hello world example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Go to start.atmel.com</li>
  <li>Click on “Create New Project”</li>
  <li>Select your MCU. In my case a SAMD51 Chip.</li>
  <li>Click on “Export Project” at the top right</li>
  <li>Give it a name, and tick the check-box for your IDE (for me: Makefile)</li>
  <li>Click on “Download Pack”</li>
  <li>Rename resulting file from <code>.azip</code> to <code>.zip</code>
</li>
  <li>Extract it</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to into IDE folder, in my case <code>gcc</code>
</li>
  <li>Fix Makefile OS detection:

<p>Silabs Cortex-M MCU comes from its acquisition of Energy Micro who was famous for
the very low power consumption of their MCUs. Silabs now makes a range of
Cortex-M based MCUs, some with 2.4GHz radios.</p>

<p>Like many of the vendors in the lower half of this list, Silabs distributes
its SDK alongside an Eclipse-based IDE. In their case, they call it “Simplicity
Studio”. While Simplicity is the best of those IDEs, it does leave those of us
who do not love Eclipse with few solutions. Here, I …</p></div></div>

                <p>When you search for premium templates for online courses and start looking at the slides, what do you find? </p>

                <p>Fancy graphs. Big numbers. Animations. Stats. World Maps.</p>

                <p>So if you want to create your own online course and teach it using slides, you may think you have to
                    use that.</p>

                  <p>  <strong>Wrong.</strong></p>

                <p>I decided to analyze the best courses and webinars out there from people that are making thousands of dollars, some of them, even millions. I wanted 
                        to understand what type of slides and visuals the top content creators were using.</p>

                <p>I was very surprised after analyzing a couple of them.</p>

                <p>No fancy graphs. No stats, no world maps, no bright and shiny visuals.</p>

                <p>So I checked more. </p>

                <p>I went through 37 top online courses and webinars and... all the slides were fairly simple.</p>

                <p><strong>Here are the 10 types of slides that professional content creators are using for their online
                        courses. And this is all you need to create yours.</strong></p>

                <p>This is where you present your course, the title of your lesson, or the main idea for your webinar.
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/cover.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>2. What are you going to learn slide</h3>

                <p>Here you introduce what's coming. People like to know what to expect from the lesson or for the
                    webinar. Normally 3 main points work best.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/whatyou.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>3. Where are we in the course</h3>

                <p>A reminder of the situation of the student, how far are we within the lesson, within the module, or
                    within the course.</p>


                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/whereare.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>4. Alternative Title</h3>

                <p>Similar to the main title, but almost all courses have an alternative way to show another title.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/alttitle.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>The Content</h3>

                <p>There are different ways on how to go about teaching the material, these are the slides used for
                    that:</p>

                <h3>5. A one-line concept</h3>

                <p>Use to explain one concept or idea. You show it on the screen and explain it further talking over it.
                    It goes along with a number generally.</p>


                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/pilar.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>6. A photo on the left (or right) with a text</h3>

                <p>It could be a photo of a phone or tablet with some freebies you are offering. A photo of a person.
                    Uses go from telling people to wait until the end of the webinar, showing a testimonial, or telling
                    a story.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/leftphoto.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>7. The Big Photo</h3>

                <p>Similar that the previous one. A very common use for this is to show a picture of something
                    funny.</p>
                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/bigphoto.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>8. Long Text</h3>

                <p>Sometimes you need more text, and this is what this slide is about, to make people read. That's not
                    recommended, but sometimes could be useful.</p>
                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/titletext.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>9. A quote</h3>


                <p>Almost 100% of the courses I analyzed have quotes.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/quote.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>10. Wrap up</h3>


                <p>A list of the previous one-line concepts into one full slide where you can give a resume of
                    everything you talked about. Very useful to wrap-up your lesson.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/resume.png" alt="cover"></p><p>If you don't want to create them yourself, <a href="https://slideslist.com/">feel free to use all of them</a>, so you can have a starting point to create your online course or
                webinar. If you want to remove the attribution <a href="https://slideslist.com/pricing"> buy a license</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The rapid advancement of technology is both a threat and an opportunity for logistics workers. Robotics, autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence could reduce the number of available jobs in certain categories. For example, <a href="http://driverlessreport.org/">one report</a> estimated that 294,000 US trucking jobs could be eliminated over the next 25 years as a result of autonomous vehicle technology. However, the growth of cloud technologies offers an opportunity for these workers to move beyond undifferentiated roles into knowledge work that is more aligned with their organization’s goals. This offers logistics workers the possibility to work in safer and more rewarding jobs that offer higher compensation.</p><p>Logistics employers are recognizing the impact of technology on their recruiting and employee retention efforts. In a <a href="https://www.supplychain247.com/paper/2019_third_party_logistics_study_the_state_of_logistics_outsourcing">2019 survey</a>, 59% of shippers and 3PLs reported that attracting talent was a top workforce issue facing their organization. The quality of an employer’s talent is a critical factor in their ability to execute on their strategic goals and succeed in competitive industries. Successfully leveraging technology investments like SaaS requires the right human resources. In the same 2019 survey, 52% of shippers said changing technology capabilities and advancements, such as digitization, automation, and predictive analytics have altered the workforce and talent strategy at their organizations. In response to these trends, employers are increasingly hiring more technology-savvy logistics workers, more business-savvy technology workers, or hybrid roles that can operate well in both competencies.</p><p>Logistics workers that understand the impact of cloud and the challenges it presents to employers can leverage these trends to transform their careers. A warehouse supervisor that focuses on simple order fulfillment tasks today could become a data analyst that rebalances inventory locations for optimal pick efficiency and reduces labor costs by analyzing seasonality and employee task performance. A customs brokerage associate that reviews trade documentation and keys data into customs software could become a process automation expert that uses cloud services like optical character recognition to automate labor-intensive tasks for her and the rest of her team. Often the first step into more differentiated roles will be value creation in their current position through the use of technology. When significant business results are delivered, leadership will want more. Eventually, new roles or career opportunities may be created to scale the initial results offered by the employee.</p><p>A career transformation from a first-line logistics worker to a logistics technologist requires planning and effort to develop the necessary skills. In work environments that use SaaS tools, these skills can often create career advancement opportunities quickly. Here are five actions logistics workers can take to support their career transformations.</p><h2 id="learn-the-logistics-domain">Learn the Logistics Domain</h2><p>A great technologist can identify business problems and build relevant solutions with technology. An individual cannot do this effectively without putting in the time and effort to learn the business domain. In logistics that means learning about transportation and warehousing. The best way to develop this domain knowledge is to get some experience doing real logistics work. Exposure to common tasks like picking orders, booking freight with carriers, auditing freight bills or communicating with customers will provide a better understanding of operational processes as well as empathy for the workers that perform these tasks.</p><p>Performing real logistics work helps the individual understand business constraints. At a superficial level, processes always appear simple and easy to improve. But by performing the task, it is possible to see the limitations and complexity that have resulted in the current state process. After executing a process in a wide range of conditions, the aspiring technologist can get an in-depth understanding of related problems and potential improvements.</p><p>Typically in any logistics organization, there are a handful of veterans that have a deep understanding of operations processes. Individuals wishing to grow their logistics careers should seek these veterans out and learn from them. An individual with a lengthy career can provide perspective about how business practices have evolved and how various types of technology affected those practices. In some cases, these veterans may not be as comfortable with newer cloud technologies, but their hesitations should be heard out and considered. Frequently SaaS products get things wrong, and highly experienced workers can provide valuable insights that can trigger enhancements or workarounds to the software to improve its efficacy. Perhaps a startup’s mobile app intended for trucker drivers may be failing to get traction. Further feedback from experienced drivers may reveal the app is not ergonomically designed for use while driving, or that the drivers have concerns with the GPS tracking feature. A worker that has spent a career driving a truck would be in an ideal position to recognize these types of obstacles.</p><p>The value of a technology solution is never fully understood until it starts facilitating business transactions with real customers. Logistics workers that interact with customers frequently are in a perfect situation to learn how technology can improve the customer’s experience. When customers need a problem to be solved, workers with strong technology capabilities reach into their toolkit of SaaS capabilities for a creative solution.</p><p>Performing daily logistics work is the most effective way to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the SaaS product. An order picking function on a mobile device may seem perfectly well-designed until an individual uses it to process a live order in the actual warehouse environment. Often constraints that were not initially considered are discovered. Those striving to become technologists in the logistics domain should seek to understand the true operational situation before attempting to automate.</p><h2 id="specialize-in-a-saas-product">Specialize in a SaaS Product</h2><p>Intimate knowledge of the organization’s SaaS products is a critical skill for an aspiring technologist. Typically, logistics workers are only trained on the specific SaaS functions that are relevant to their daily tasks. However, a holistic understanding of the SaaS and its capabilities provides a broader context about how the software is designed and how it can add value.</p><p>Logistics workers can develop their expertise by reviewing the SaaS product’s user documentation and training materials. Sometimes this information is publicly available on the provider’s web site or social media sites. Exploring the provider’s API documentation can also provide a better understanding of the software’s internal architecture and key database entities. If the SaaS provider offers a certification program, workers should use this opportunity to learn the system and demonstrate their knowledge to employers. Examples of these certifications in the logistics field are the Oracle Warehouse Management Cloud 2018 Certified Implementation Specialist and the CargoWise Certified Professional.</p><p>Actively working with the SaaS tool in live business operations will probably be the best way for logistics workers to deepen their knowledge. Whenever new business scenarios are encountered, workers should welcome these opportunities to learn new software features. When internal stakeholders or customers are looking for data, ambitious logistics workers should embrace the challenge to locate the data in the SaaS and extract it into a usable format. Solving real business problems and overcoming daily challenges will lead to a strong foundational knowledge about the SaaS which will support more advanced pursuits like developing automation or integrations.</p><h2 id="automate-and-integrate">Automate and Integrate</h2><p>A common path to creating business value will be automating business processes and integrating systems. Even a rudimentary ability to automate SaaS processes and integrate with the SaaS’s API will be highly valued in the cloud-powered workplace. Logistics workers can start by learning about any existing workflow capabilities in the SaaS tool. Often SaaS tools include built-in automation features that trigger emails, data extracts, or user tasks. One should learn which capabilities are supported natively in the software before moving on to more complex automation approaches.</p><p>Another approach to automating SaaS-based processes is using automation tools that manipulate the user interface. RPA tools like Blue Prism, UiPath, and Automation Anywhere are specifically targeted toward this. However there are simpler ways of automating processes and repetitive tasks. Browser automation tools allow users to record their interactions in a web browser and create scripts to repeat this interaction automatically. This type of tool could be used to start up the SaaS application, log in, navigate to a particular menu item, and trigger a process, at a certain time every day. There are a variety of tools that focus on automating web user interfaces including UI.Vision Kantu, Progress iMacros for Chrome, Katalon Recorder, or the Selenium browser test automation framework. Even simple text expansion tools can help automate some repetitive tasks. Perhaps it is necessary to type the same string of text in notes for every purchase order. A tool like Text Expander can insert snippets of text based on a short abbreviation, and the snippet library can be shared across team members.</p><p>Logistics technologists should also develop a deep understanding of their SaaS tool’s API. If the SaaS is already integrated with a process automation tool, that can be an effective way to start experimenting. Logistics workers can set up workflows that trigger emails when certain events happen in the SaaS, store data in third party services for analysis, or integrate the SaaS with other systems like …</p></div></div>

<p>
<time datetime="2020-11-14">Saturday, November 14, 2020</time>
</p>
<p>I’ve been running <a href="https://djharper.dev/post/2020/06/07/running-linux-on-my-macbook/">Linux</a> on my personal computer for nearly six months now and just thought I’d write about a neat feature in systemd called <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html">systemd.socket</a></p>
<h2 id="personal-finance-on-demand">Personal finance on-demand</h2>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Created a socket activated service to spin up a local webapp I use sometimes when something connects to it, and then tear it down again after 5 minutes</p>
<p>I’m a big personal finance nerd and have spent the last 3 years cultivating a ledger file that contains pretty much every facet of my financial life. This file is in a format understood by a suite of command line software called <a href="https://beancount.github.io/">Beancount</a>. It’s is made even better used in conjunction with <a href="https://beancount.github.io/fava/">Fava</a>, a webapp to explore your beancount file.</p>
<p>Fava is a HTTP a service that reads your beancount file stored on disk and presents you with a series of reports and charts to help you make sense of it. I usually only use it when editing my file or occasionally when I need to check something.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://djharper.dev/img/fava.png"><img src="https://djharper.dev/img/fava.png" title="Example screenshot taken from https://beancount.github.io/fava/"></a>
<figcaption><br>Example screenshot taken from https://beancount.github.io/fava/ </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For quite some time I had this as a <code>--user</code> level systemd service, enabled to run on startup. This worked fine, but I noticed recently that the process seems to consume 2% CPU <em>at all times</em>. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things but battery life on my laptop comes at a premium.</p>

<figcaption><br>Fava CPU usage </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This made me think, <em>what if there is a way of starting up Fava only when I need it</em> 🤔, sort of like the serverless compute world where resources are spun up on-demand. It was at this point I remembered reading about <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html">systemd.socket</a> where you can activate a service when something connects on a socket. At the time I’d filed it away under the “that sounds cool but I’ll probably never use it” place in my brain, but it’s pleasing to now have an actual use case!</p>
<p>The setup is as follows</p>
<p>Create a <code>fava.socket</code> file under <code>~/.config/systemd/user</code> - this sets up the socket.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>Unit<span>]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span>Fava Socket
<span>PartOf</span><span>=</span>fava.service

<span>[</span>Socket<span>]</span>
<span>ListenStream</span><span>=</span><span>127</span>.0.0.1:5000

<span>[</span>Install<span>]</span>
<span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span>sockets.target</code></pre></div>
<p>Create a <code>fava.service</code> file under <code>~/.config/systemd/user</code> - this defines the service</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>Unit<span>]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span>Fava
<span>After</span><span>=</span>network.target fava.socket

<span>[</span>Service<span>]</span>
<span>Type</span><span>=</span>simple
<span>ExecStart</span><span>=</span>fava -H <span>127</span>.0.0.1 /home/djh/beancount/financials.beancount
<span>RuntimeMaxSec</span><span>=</span><span>300</span> <span># kill the service after 5 minutes.</span>

<span>[</span>Install<span>]</span>
<span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span>default.target</code></pre></div>
<p>Enable and start the socket + service</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user <span>enable</span> fava.socket
systemctl --user start fava.socket</code></pre></div>
<p>Go to a web browser and visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:5000</code> and Fava should load.</p>
<p>After 5 minutes the service will be terminated, but you can start it again by refreshing the page.</p>
<p>Ideally I’d want the socket to terminate the service if nothing connects to it for 5 minutes but I’m not sure how to do that, hence the <code>RuntimeMaxSec</code> setting in the service file 😞</p>
<h2 id="better-ways">Better ways</h2>
<p>You might be wondering why not just host Fava on a Raspberry Pi, it’s a web application afterall. In my case I tend to only use it when editing my beancount file which is stored locally on my Mac. Changes are committed to a git repository when I’m happy with them. The hosted version could listen to changes to this git repository and keep its local copy up to date I suppose, but I’d have to constantly create/push commits to see my changes. This approach also requires network access.</p>
<p>Another way would to just run <code>fava</code> directly on the command line when I need it, but I like the idea of requesting it on demand via a HTTP request and letting systemd handle the rest.</p>
<p>Anyways just thought I’d share x.</p>

<![CDATA[No, “Open Source” Does Not Mean “Includes Free Support”]]>

      We need to talk.
    </p><div>

<p>Here’s a paraphrased conversation I’m having way to often, costing me way too much time, keeping me from doing things that are way more important:</p>

<pre>User: Hi, I'd like to report a bug in your application.
Me:   Great! Please open a support ticket, then.
User: But, it looks like I need to pay for that?
Me:   So?
User: I just want to tell you that your app is broken, so you can fix it.
Me:   Yes, that's a support request, please open a ticket.
User: ...
</pre>

<figure>
  <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support/bugreport.png">
    <img src="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support/bugreport.png">
  </a>
  
</figure><p>
                             
                             
From there it typically derails into a whiny tirade about me being a crappy two bit developer who doesn’t give a shit about his code (which is ridiculous, since, professional pride aside, I have every incentive to fix bugs, to prevent my inbox from getting flooded) and just wants to rip off his users.</p>

<p>In the past, I sometimes gave in (when it sounded like something might be wrong). I looked at the issue and almost always found that nothing was broken, just didn’t work as expected (which is actually to be expected for every reasonably complex piece of software). The user just didn’t bother reading the docs and tried to bypass the fee by masquerading the support request as a bug report. So, nowadays my policy simply is: no support ticket, no service. Any such request goes straight to the trash folder without even being looked at.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-such-an-asshole">Why am I such an asshole?</h2>

<p>Here’s the thing: I write open source software to solve <strong>my problem</strong>. I let you use my solutions because that comes at zero cost for me (well, almost, I still have to pay for the website, you are downloading from. You are welcome, by the way). I also provide the source code, so you can fix things yourself, should my solution turn out to be unsuitable. However, once you come to me with a “bugreport” that doesn’t also include a patch (or at least very precisely pinpoints the problem), then you are basically asking me to <strong>look at your problem</strong>. At this point, it is no longer zero cost for me and that’s the reason for why I am charging you money: you are asking me to spent time on your behalf. That is commonly called <strong>work</strong>. And surprisingly enough, work is what people expect to be paid for.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m happy to help. Selling support is what keeps the lights on here (did I mention the cost of running a webserver?). But coming to me under false pretense and/or expecting that I <strong>must</strong> provide free service on top of a software I gave away without charge is not going to win you any favours.</p>

<p>It stops being free, when it starts costing me! My time is valuable. If you want a piece of it, I want money in return. Period.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems like this post has struck a nerve and caused a few misunderstandings. <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/reactions-bugreport-free-support/">Clarification on my position here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>I’ve been in big enterprises, as a day job, for almost 6 years now. I’ve also been working on, and growing, a large scale microservice architecture (about 150 microservices) for about 18 months.</p>
<p>In one way microservices give large enterprises the ability to split large work across a variety of teams with isolated codebases. If the published APIs for these microservices don’t change, none of the producers or consumers into that service care about maintenance or features added to that service.</p>
<p>Yet the working of the product as a whole requires all the micoservices to be deployed, with compatible versions, into the deployment environments.</p>
<p>From a high level perspective it doesn’t matter if these services communicate via HTTPS, protobuf, custom TCP protocols, or message buses like Kafka or an MQ flavor. Microservice A still acts on data that’s supposed to be created by Microservice B, and if it’s not there the user’s going to wonder.</p>
<p>If a user posts a photo on a social network type product, and it doesn’t show up after a couple of seconds the user gets worried. If it doesn’t show up ever - because Microservice A posted the photo to some message queue but Microservice B wasn’t deployed to read and respond to the message - that’s actually a bug. As much as a dialog box in the users face would be.</p>
<p>That dependence: Microservice A requires microservice B, which requires microservice C, all deployed for the product <em>and customer’s user journey</em> to work together, is why it’s called a “herd” of microservices. (or a web of microservices, but herd is the more industry-common name).</p>

<p>Enterprise software engineering is waayyy different from startups. Before my time in BigCo land I spent a lot of time in “small projects and startups” land.</p>
<p>I enumerate some of this article’s assumptions here, assuming they are close to universal. My sample size is small, but I don’t think I just got (un) lucky in my experiences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Of &gt; 500 engineers. Some of which work on things totally unknown to you!</li>
<li>codebases owned by teams. (Because in BigCos having a thing owned by a single person makes people antsy, at least in the BigCos I’ve been in. And having a single group of people makes it easy to <em>page them</em>).</li>
<li>Multiple teams per end user project.</li>
<li>The enterprise is now trying to - or successfully have - transitioned to microservices.</li>
<li>Unified discovery or apparent similar route (“oh look the /search api!“. Maybe behind the curtain it’s 5 teams with 20 microservices or lambdas - whatever, the caller doesn’t know or care)</li>
<li>Microservices can be grouped by what downstream or peer services they call or rely on. (The next section will talk about this cluster or “clique” effect)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: it’s possible - but exceptional - for a microservice to <em>not</em> have an owner. Perhaps the team owning it all got laid off, or all quit before replacements could be hired. From a corporate perspective this is bad - a year or two from now when that microservice breaks, you’ll have a game of hot potato around who needs to fix it… on the double because there’s some customer facing bug. It’s also, very likely, making teams that depend on those microservices nervous, because, “ummm, who <em>is</em> maintaining the Ad Data Repository that we interface with? Ummm…”</p>
<p>Likewise, it’s possible - but should be exceptional - for a microservice to have <em>two</em> owners. In my experience this means you’re either starting to rebuild a monolith, or introducing situations where Team A doesn’t want to deploy but Team B does.</p>

<p>If we consider all the microservices required for a product - or products - to be a herd of microservices you’ll notice something. You’ll notice that these herds form microservice <em>cliques</em> - the login service only talks to the auth database and the email service, but never the file upload service, for example.</p>
<p>Additionally (because this is the enterprise) teams, not individuals, own services. A team may potentially own the majority of services in a clique, or a couple of cliques. If the enterprise is wise there may be some domain drive design modeling going on to better classify these cliques.</p>
<p>I suspect there are three, maybe four, ways to split up the enterprise to serve a product (or multiple products).</p>

<p>Note that the stars in these pictures may be microservices, but could be front end library components.</p>
<h2>Single product, layered approach</h2>

    </span></p>
<p>This organization has teams close to the user, and teams creating services uncoupled from any one product. Imagine the teams working on our social media app, and the a “data platforms” team that handles hard data storage, vendor data imports, or interfaces to the real source of records.</p>
<p>This is very likely Conway’s Law at play: the database team maintains the big database, and (because enterprise) everything currently flows through the big database. This big database is the Source Of Record.</p>
<h3>Another lens</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Teams-Strategies-Successful-Organizations/dp/149195227X/ref=nodl_">Scaling Teams</a> talks about these teams as potentially being part of a platform. Platform in the most generic of words: “the iOS team”, “the web team”, “the android team”. The “APIs” are provided by folks working on “the backend team”.</p>
<p>Yet the diagram still works for this structure of teams. Chapter 7 of <em>Scaling Teams</em> touches on several themes also in this blog entry.</p>
<h2>Many products, layered approach</h2>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<p>Here we have multiple products. Notice that some products aren’t connected to the rest of the herd. Product B is somewhat connected: think how Instagram uses Facebook for authorization, but that’s it.</p>
<h2>Cross functional teams</h2>
<p>Cross functional teams aren’t super new - I heard about them when I was in Total Quality Management classes in college.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://blog.wilcoxd.com/static/7f84f9cd965c4d23f80eff6d50ea3e1b/636d3/cross-functional-teams.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>But the idea here is that a “two pizza team” should be empowered to change everything about some sliver of functionality from the UI all the way down the stack. Because - an often quoted definition - an agile feature isn’t shipped until a user <em>sees</em> it.</p>
<p>I would also posit that these cross-functional teams don’t break Conway’s Law, but may graft a cross-functional layer on top of the existing org structure.</p>
<p>Likewise, I suspect this approach means you have an implicit layered model too. Perhaps you have services created using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends">Backend For Frontend</a> design pattern. Our example social media enterprise might have a BFF microservice that supplies data for the mobile app, and a “data layer” service… which a BFF microservice for the Alexa app uses. I attempt to illustrate that in the diagram, in fact.</p>
<p>I’m not convinced GraphQL solves this problem either - you may have queries and mutations used heavily by some other team too.</p>

<p>Regardless of how your org chart really looks, if - and since - teams are coupled to microservices you can either make your system design look like your org chart <em>or</em> facade over that org chart. Either way you can draw a box around microservice owners and (hopefully!) find edges of parts of your business domain. Or, if that doesn’t work, find the cliques and draw boxes around <em>them</em>.</p>
<h2>on data, technical debt as a metaphor, and other cross cutting concerns</h2>
<p>Take a look back at those diagrams. Notice the different database organizations of the various structures. A layered organization will likely have <em>only</em> one or two databases controlled by the product teams (for “closeness of data” or “only <em>we</em> care about this particular part of the data”) where the teams downstream are the “source of record”.</p>
<p>In a fully cross-functional example there <em>is</em> no “downstream”. Yet the organization still has data to store, maintain and guard. Teams may create a database or two, or one per microservice, to store this data. Yet I would argue that “data standards” is an enterprise wide concern. Is the data secured in transmit and rest, potentially using approved data storage tech, with proper access rights? No enterprise wants a privacy leak and lawsuit like Target or Equifax.</p>
<p>So, how does an enterprise, or a group of teams working on a single product inside the enterprise, establish data standards?</p>
<p>Likewise, how does “technical debt” - perhaps “oh yeah we should secure this database, it’s some technical debt we need to clean up” of a microservice, of a clique, affect the herd? Or the product? Or the business?</p>
<p>In fact, I’m starting to dislike the analogy of technical debt, and starting to lean into the idea of the <a href="https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1314311394406346752?s=21">functional capability</a> of a system.</p>
<p>In the US there’s often both bad roads and lots of road construction, so the model of functional capacity of a system being <strong>a road to deliver the customer journey</strong> feels natural to me.</p>
<p>If our journey is to drive features to the customer, then we want well paved roads so we can drive quickly, not dirt roads where 35MPH is all you can go. We also want certain, built in, abilities of the road: smooth ride, experts on call in case we break a tire (or a database!), and potentially some kind of guidance to ensure our car is safe to use on the road and not harming others or the environment (like spewing customer data everywhere).</p>
<p>This is the topic of a future blog post: roads and feature capacity of microservice herds. Which will be a much easier conversation to have now that we understand microservices, cliques, herds, products, teams, and how enterprises mash those concepts up in different ways.</p></section></div>]]>

    <p>
        <time datetime="">10 Nov 2020</time>
      </p>

    <p>This post is clearing up confusions around mocking in Elixir. If you were ever confused about mocks and stubs in Elixir, I made it 100% clear for you.</p>

<p><strong>Mocking</strong> is the testing technique to replace underlying code behaviour with the response we want. Typically we use it to mock modules that depend on 3rd-party services, APIs, internet connection, or system dependencies. <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mox/Mox.html">Mox</a> is my go-to library for mocking in Elixir.</p>

<p>Note that the distinction between mocks and stubs is highly inconsistent across the literature. I am using my own understanding of the terms that is aligned with the Mox documentation.</p>

<h2 id="stubs">Stubs</h2>

<p>Before we dive into mocking, let’s define stubs and how we can use them without any mocking at all.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub">Wikipedia</a> a <strong>stub</strong> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A method stub or simply stub in software development is a piece of code used to stand in for some other programming functionality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like to remember it as a counterfoil of a document in the physical world.</p>

<p>Replacing the real modules with stubs is as easy as using dependency injection or simply taking advantage of the environment configuration:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># config/config.exs</span>
<span>config</span> <span>:my_app</span><span>,</span> <span>Subscriptions</span><span>,</span> <span>stripe_service:</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>StripeService</span>

<span># config/test.exs</span>
<span>config</span> <span>:my_app</span><span>,</span> <span>Subscriptions</span><span>,</span> <span>stripe_service:</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceStub</span>

<span># lib/my_app/subscriptions.ex</span>
<span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@stripe_service</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>get_env</span><span>(</span><span>:my_app</span><span>,</span> <span>__MODULE__</span><span>)[</span><span>:stripe_service</span><span>]</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>charge_customer</span><span>(</span><span>customer_id</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>@stripe_service</span><span>.</span><span>charge_customer</span><span>(</span><span>customer_id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also use a <code>test_helper.exs</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>put_env</span><span>(</span><span>:my_app</span><span>,</span> <span>:stripe_service</span><span>,</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceStub</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>MyApp.StripeService</code> could be our wrapper around Stripity Stripe library accessing stripe.com. <code>StripeServiceStub</code> would be a module not too different from <code>MyApp.StripeService</code> returning predefined responses.</p>

<p>The idea is that all the code that needs Stripe working will be satisfied with a generic response. It’s straightforward.</p>

<p>I like to put such modules in <code>test/support/stubs/</code> directory with the full path and a name with appended <code>Stub</code>. This is just my convention.</p>

<p>If we want to stay organized, we should also define common behaviour:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># lib/my_app/subscriptions/stripe_service.ex</span>
<span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeService</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@behaviour</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceBehaviour</span>

<span># test/support/stubs/stripe_service_stub.ex</span>
<span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceStub</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@behaviour</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceBehaviour</span>

<span># lib/my_app/subscriptions/stripe_service_behaviour.ex</span>
<span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceBehaviour</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@callback</span> <span>charge_customer</span><span>(</span><span>integer</span><span>())</span> <span>::</span> <span>tuple</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This behaviour will also become crucial when using Mox.</p>

<h2 id="mocks">Mocks</h2>

<p>Most of the time, stubs won’t be enough because we want some flexibility. If we call <code>MyApp.Subscriptions.charge_customer</code>, we might want to adjust the response based on the scenario we are working with. More likely than not, we want to test all possible error responses.</p>

<p><strong>Mock</strong> objects in object-oriented programming are mimicking the behaviour of the actual objects. Similarly, mocks in Mox mimick the behaviour of modules and their functions.</p>

<p>I like to remember mocking as mimicking someone in the physical world.</p>

<p>When introducing Mox, we should think about stubs as our defaults. I like to put a typical success path into the stub. Stubs are great for this because I can use 100 stubs across the whole system and still test a module at hand at any level of abstractions.</p>

<p>So, how to transform from plain stubs to stubs with Mox? First, we should write our behaviour as above. Then we can to define a mock module for our behaviour in <code>test/stubs/mox.ex</code> as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># test/stubs/mox.ex</span>
<span>Mox</span><span>.</span><span>defmock</span><span>(</span><span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceMock</span><span>,</span>
  <span>for:</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceBehaviour</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The mock module can be named as you wish, but I like to keep things organized by appending <code>Mock</code>.</p>

<p>This mock module is a module Mox can now use to mimick the behaviour we predefined. With this change, we could import Mox in a test file and start mocking.</p>

<p>To make a fallback for our mock, we have to tell Mox to default to the stub module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># test/support/stripe_service_mock.ex</span>
<span>defmodule</span> <span>StripeServiceMock</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>ExUnit</span><span>.</span><span>CaseTemplate</span>

  <span>setup</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>Mox</span><span>.</span><span>stub_with</span><span>(</span>
      <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceMock</span><span>,</span>
      <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceStub</span>
    <span>)</span>

    <span># more stub_with/2 calls possible</span>

    <span>:ok</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Awesome, now we are ready to change our test config to the mock module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># config/test.exs</span>
<span>config</span> <span>:my_app</span><span>,</span> <span>Subscriptions</span><span>,</span> <span>stripe_service:</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceMock</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="mocking">Mocking</h2>

<p>We configured a mock module in tests for our <code>MyApp.Subscriptions</code> module. We also told Mox to default to the stub module. We are ready to write some tests, aren’t we?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>SubscriptionsTest</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>alias</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span>

  <span>use</span> <span>StripeServiceMock</span><span>,</span> <span>async:</span> <span>true</span>

  <span>describe</span> <span>"charge_customer/1"</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>setup</span> <span>:create_customer</span>

    <span>test</span> <span>"charges the right amount"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>customer:</span> <span>customer</span><span>}</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>charge</span><span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>charge_customer</span><span>(</span><span>customer</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span>

      <span># asserts</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>By using the <code>StripeServiceMock</code> module, we are automatically defaulting to the stub modules as if we would specify it in the config directly. This is especially useful for higher level code that is not even concerned with Stripe at all.</p>

<p>What about the errors?</p>

<p>If we import Mox, we can <em>mock</em> any specific function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>SubscriptionsTest</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>alias</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span>

  <span>import</span> <span>Mox</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>StripeServiceMock</span><span>,</span> <span>async:</span> <span>true</span>

  <span>describe</span> <span>"charge_customer/1"</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>setup</span> <span>:create_customer</span>

    <span>test</span> <span>"charges the right amount"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>customer:</span> <span>customer</span><span>}</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>...</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>test</span> <span>"returns an error"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>customer:</span> <span>customer</span><span>}</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceMock</span>
      <span>|&gt;</span> <span>stub</span><span>(</span><span>:charge_customer</span><span>,</span> <span>fn</span> <span>_customer_id</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>error</span> <span>=</span> <span>%{</span><span>...</span><span>}</span>
        <span>{</span><span>:error</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>}</span>
      <span>end</span><span>)</span>

      <span>{</span><span>:error</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>charge_customer</span><span>(</span><span>customer</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span>

      <span># asserts</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By piping the mock module to <code>Mox.stub/2</code> we are able to <em>mimick</em> the behaviour of <code>charge_customer/1</code> with another <em>stub</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><h2 id="because-they-probably-wont">…because they probably won’t</h2><p>I recently watched a few videos on YouTube about the latest and greatest LEGO sets. I didn’t do it because I’m super interested in LEGO (that was a while ago) but because the YouTube algorithm decided that I had to. I naturally obeyed. The results were as expected: I felt old and none of those sets triggered any kind of “I need to have this” response. Until I saw this:</p><p><img src="https://www.krewast.de/img/artikel-lego-tree-house.jpg" alt="Lego Tree House"></p><p>This beautiful tree house immediately sparked my interest. It’s cute, it’s not one of those boring license sets (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Minecraft, …), the price to number of LEGO pieces ratio is okay (still super expensive!) and it would fit nicely between my house plants which I foster - and sometimes kill - in my living room.</p><p>So, I did something I usually never do: I made an impulse buy. I put the 195&nbsp;€ tree house into the shopping cart, created a LEGO user account, entered all my data, chose “Invoice” as payment method and clicked “Buy”. I received the automatic “Thank you for your purchase” e-mail and felt happy.</p><h2 id="we-are-sorry">We are sorry</h2><p>On the next day I received another e-mail. This time from the LEGO customer service. You can find the original German version at the end of this post, here is a short translation of the important part:</p><blockquote>Dear Bastian Kres,<p>thank you for ordering your LEGO® toy directly from us.</p><p>Unfortunately, the total amount of your order exceeds the credit limit for payment on account and by direct debit. Therefore, we are not able to send this order yet.</p><p>Please call us to pay by VISA or MasterCard. […]</p></blockquote><p>Well, here’s the thing: LEGO knew that I was a first time customer and they also knew that the total amount of my order was about 195 €. If they didn’t want me to pay on account, why did they offer me the option?</p><h2 id="how-to-kill-enthusiasm">How to kill enthusiasm</h2><p>1.) I would like to mention that wouldn’t have had a problem to pay in advance. PayPal or credit card are good options which I use all the time. But by sending me this e-mail after I already selected my preferred payment method and ordered the thing, LEGO basically tells me that I cannot be trusted. And at the same time they want me to trust them…</p><p>2.) As I wrote before, this purchase was an impulse buy. The tree house is something I wanted. But after receiving this e-mail I had lot of time to think about whether or not I still do? Especially because I could buy a huge amount of real plants for 195&nbsp;€. That would be good for nature, but bad for LEGO.</p><p>3.) By postponing the delivery until after I paid, they also created a whole new experience for me. Now I don’t have the tree house in my hands, see how nice it is and pay happily. No, now I have this bitter taste in my mouth and a decision to make. Should I really be making decisions after I already ordered something?</p><h2 id="some-lessons-for-online-stores">Some lessons for online stores</h2><p>As a web developer I always find it interesting to see how even very big companies still make mistakes like this. But the good thing is: We can learn from them!</p><ul><li>Make it easy for customers to order from you, avoid any friction or inconveniences</li><li>Offer customers a broad set of payment options, omit those you deem too risky</li><li>Don’t send customers “We don’t trust you” messages after they already ordered something from you. It totally kills their enthusiasm</li></ul><p>And that’s it.</p><p>One last question remains: Did LEGO dodge a bullet because I would have sent the tree house back anyway? Maybe, but probably not. I rarely send anything back for two reasons: It’s an effort and I’m generally lazy ;)</p><p>If any of this sound snarky: I’m sorry, that was never my intention. I just found it interesting (and wanted to share) how LEGO decided to set up this process, what consequences it can have and how I probably won’t get a new toy but at least ten new house plants.</p><hr><p>Obligatory link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_EZd3lsmxudu3IQzpTzOgw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Held der Steine</a> and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIQJV2o6EPY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LEGO Tree House</a> video.</p><h2 id="the-original-german-e-mail">The original German e-mail</h2><blockquote>Guten Tag Bastian Kres,<p>vielen Dank, dass Sie Ihr LEGO® Spielzeug direkt bei uns bestellt haben.</p><p>Leider überschreitet die Gesamtsumme Ihrer Bestellung die Kreditgrenze für Zahlung auf Rechnung und per Lastschriftverfahren.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>


<pre title="">const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();
</pre>


<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(commitment) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(114));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const storedCommitment = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50, 114));
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);
    if (!(await sodium.sodium_memcmp(storedCommitment, commitment))) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect commitment value");
    }
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For the past year, I've been on a leave of absence from college working on a startup. As I prepare for my return to school, what comes next has been on my mind.</p><p>Leaving college made me realize there are more career options than ever seemed available to me as a student. I would have expected that taking time off would have had the opposite effect—bringing me up to speed on the areas that interest me and those I should steer clear of. Naturally, the list of options should have winnowed after stepping outside of the college bubble. On the contrary, I find myself with dozens of ideas of things to work on, far more than what seemed possible in college.</p><p>College made it seem like there were just a few worthwhile career tracks. When I chose to take time off, I left in the middle of my junior year during the peak of on-campus recruiting, the process by which Harvard students compete for internships at a narrow list of companies. I say "narrow" to emphasize the fact that just three industries captured the attention of my peers: <strong>finance, big tech, and consulting (FTC)</strong>. When you subtract out the students attending grad school or who don't immediately enter the workforce, nearly half choose one of these fields.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Why?</p><h3>Why FTC?</h3><p>The simplest explanation is money. Students want high-paying jobs and these are industries that pay higher on average. But it's naive to chalk all of this up to economics—there are many instances when students are offered an equally competitive job in terms of salary and still opt for FTC. I recall many different industries, such as consumer packaged goods companies, recruiting and offering salaries similar to entry-level management consulting—but they were seldom the talk of campus.</p><p>Neither is it interest. The average Harvard student would probably prefer to work on Google Maps over Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese, but this doesn't explain why students have such narrow interests <em>within</em> FTC. Why are Google and Facebook so attractive to prospective engineers while Stripe and Nvidia are never brought up? Or why do aspiring consultants obsess over McKinsey, Bain, and BCG to the exclusion of more boutique firms with similar compensation structures?<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> Holding interest constant, students' decisions are still clustered around a few companies.</p><p>When discussing management consulting, many students talked about how they liked the "optionality" that the industry offered. In short, they viewed it as a few more years of college without the pressure to choose a particular career path. I think people felt similarly about finance and big tech—they didn't narrow your career trajectory in the same way a more niche company might have. But again, this doesn't explain why within FTC, students are still so fixated on a few specific companies.</p><p>When I asked my peers why they preferred these particular firms, they often answered that they were better than the rest of the industry. But by which logic are they better? When asked about the specifics, they'd often give vague non-answers that seemed almost scripted. "I like Bain because I feel like I have a good fit with the firm". Or, "Goldman is attractive to me because it has a culture of excellence." These answers were unsatisfying because it was clear they were ad hoc rationalizations. Thankfully, one student was once blunt enough to confirm what everyone already knew: "I want Google on my resume because it is prestigious." For most, these firms were top of mind because they were prestigious, not because they resonated particularly well with the individual applicant.</p><p>For students unsure of what career to pursue, prestige is often the driving metric in job selection. For many, prestige is useful in that it guarantees one is respected and admired for the job they ultimately choose. This explains the ad hoc rationalizations from before and why students often expressed interest in FTC before they even fully understood what their work would entail. it's like a kindergartener saying "doctor" when adults ask them what they want to be when they grow up. Their answer says more about the desires of the group than themselves.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p><h3>What is Prestige?</h3><p>Prestige is a measure of how much status a group assigns to something. From this definition, a lot of interesting qualities of prestige can be discerned.</p><p>Since prestige depends upon what the <em>group</em> thinks, then it follows that it is not a fixed nor immutable quality. Groups of people differ everywhere, so what is prestigious in one place is not necessarily prestigious in another.</p><p>For example, many college students would love to work for a Silicon Valley startup—but I know of few Harvard students who prefer startups over big tech. Again, this isn't an economic decision—recruits of later-stage startups can command the same or even better compensation than FAANG in some cases—but I've never heard of a Harvard CS major wanting to work for Stripe.<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> This is surprising since Stripe is prestigious <em>within</em> the Valley itself. Prestige's dependence on the group makes it a localized phenomenon.</p><p>Prestige also changes over time. What we considered prestigious a hundred years ago is very different from what we do today because social status has changed a lot. Understanding the evolution of social status is worthy of a whole separate essay (or perhaps a book). However, I suspect that prestige is closely linked to our economy and thus downstream of culture, policy, and most of all, technology. This would explain why it's more prestigious to start a startup today than it was a hundred years ago—one can simply become a lot richer than they could before.</p><h3>The Roots of Prestige</h3><p>So if prestige depends upon what people find to be high status, then where does it originate in the first place? That is, how does a group come to deem something prestigious initially? The best <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">explanation</a> for prestige I've seen thus far comes from Paul Graham:</p><blockquote><p>"Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll <em>make</em> it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself."</p></blockquote><p>Groups assign status to the things which accurately signal the values and aspirations of that group. For elite college students, FTC originally became prestigious because they represented the height of excellence in the workforce at some point—something this group deeply values.</p><p>Each of the top companies within FTC once transformed their industries, inspiring the ambitious to follow suit. For example, James McKinsey <a href="https://longreads.com/2013/10/23/the-making-of-mckinsey-a-brief-history-of-management/">invented</a> managerial accounting and dramatically improved his clients' budgeting processes. Goldman employees <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/history/a-brief-history-of-gs.pdf">pioneered</a> the price-to-earnings ratio, now ubiquitous in modern finance. And of course, Gates, Jobs, and other big tech founders are revered in American culture. These accomplishments earned their firms a prestigious reputation once, and they've managed to keep it ever since.</p><p>Prestige is self-reinforcing for its holders in the same way that network effects make big tech hard to topple. Namely, prestigious firms leverage their name and rigorous hiring practices to target top students for recruitment. As students see the best of their class joining these firms, the companies' reputation becomes further entrenched, attracting the next generation of talent. Prestige acts as a competitive moat for these firms and replicates itself over time.</p><h3>The Prestige Trap</h3><p>At first glance, it doesn't seem worrisome to factor prestige into one's job search. If these firms benefit so greatly from their prestige, wouldn't students also be well-served by having them on their resume? Maybe, but only if students are focusing on the right thing.</p><p>Prestige, like the social status it serves as a proxy for, is useful as a form of signaling. To the uninformed observer, it indicates that one is a member of the highly successful creative class. We assume, because we associate these firms with excellence, that possessing prestigious titles demonstrates excellence too. Furthermore, it's hard to evaluate people individually, so we often outsource our decision making and rely upon prestige as a neutral arbiter, regardless of its accuracy.</p><p>If third-parties look at prestige as an indicator of excellence, then it becomes a rough heuristic for replicating success in one's social environment. The top FTC companies represent an opportunity for elite students to become a James McKinsey or Henry Goldman in their own right. Ambitious students seek out prestige thinking it is the missing ingredient to achieving their own excellence. In reality, they have it backward—prestige <em>follows</em> excellence. Exposure to prestige can't make you successful any more than spending time around rich people can make you wealthy.<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></p><p>Achieving prestige and excellence are not mutually exclusive. Although, one does depend upon the other. Pursuing prestige for its own sake will not lead to excellence, but the reverse can occur. When most ambitious students turn to prestige as a heuristic, they're really just trying to answer the question: "How do I become successful in life and achieve great things?" This explains why many of my peers returned from these prestigious jobs and internships, feeling more dissatisfied than before. They realized that what they were looking for was deeper and more nuanced than could be provided for by an additional resume item.</p><p>Unfortunately, optimizing for prestige is a poor source of evolutionary pressure. It is usually easier to feign excellence than for one to actually cultivate it. Getting a job at a big tech company is a very different thing than becoming an excellent software engineer. A student can find themselves with all of the trappings of success—the distinguished credentials, resume fillers, and prestigious titles—but without having achieved the true excellence they were seeking in the first place. In this way, prestige becomes a trap.</p><p>Why do top students fall for this trap and chase …</p></section></div>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The Polish QWERTY variant named "lefty", introduced below, moves all the Polish
letters to keys that are accessed by the left hand.  The right hand's sole
responsibility is simply holding the <code>AltGr</code> modifier key.</p>

<p>This eliminates the three awkward typing positions for the letters: <code>Ł</code>, <code>Ó</code>
and <code>Ń</code>.</p>

<h2>Streszczenie</h2>

<p>Przedstawiam poniżej wariant polskiej klawiatury QWERTY o nazwie
"lefty". Wariant ten umieszcza wszystkie polskie litery pod klawiszami
obsługiwanymi lewą ręką. Jedyną rolą prawej ręki pozostaje przytrzymywanie
klawisza <code>AltGr</code>.</p>

<p>Pozwala to na wyeliminowanie uciążliwych kombinacji dla liter <code>Ł</code>, <code>Ó</code>, oraz
<code>Ń</code>.</p>

<h2>The Polish Letters</h2>

<p>Here is a standard PC ISO QWERTY keyboard. This is the kind of (physical)
keyboard we use in Poland. Some computers come with an ANSI keyboard (flat,
wide Enter key), and other come with an ISO keyboard (tall Enter key,
pictured). To Polish typists, however, the ISO/ANSI distinction doesn't make
that much of a difference, because neither of these layouts have decidated keys
for our special letters.</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty.png" alt="qwerty keyboard"></p>

<p>We must fit the following 9 letters (in upper- and lowercase) in our keyboard
layout, on top of all the standard Latin letters:</p>

<p><strong><code>Ą</code> <code>Ć</code> <code>Ę</code> <code>Ł</code> <code>Ń</code> <code>Ó</code> <code>Ś</code> <code>Ź</code> <code>Ż</code></strong></p>

<p>How will we do this? We'll need to use special key combinations.</p>

<h2>AltGr, the Lopsided Alt</h2>

<p>They way most systems (Windows, Linux) accomplish the task of adding Polish
letters to an ISO keyboard is by using the right 'Alt' key as 'AltGr' — a
modifier key that upgrades regular letters on the keyboard to weird
glyphs. (For example, holding <code>AltGr+2</code> emits the <code>²</code> character,
<code>AltGr+Shift+-</code> gives me the emdash:—.)</p>

<p>The thing to note is that <strong>there is only one AltGr key on the keyboard!</strong> This
is the right <code>alt</code> key, because the left one is still necessary to function as
the regular <code>alt</code>. Case in point: <code>alt+tab</code> window switching does not work with
the <code>AltGr</code> key.</p>

<p>To type Polish letters, we hold down the <code>AltGr</code> key and press the
corresponding key to type a lowercase letter, and <code>AltGr+Shift+key</code> to get the
uppercase.</p>

<table>
  <thead> <tr><td>Key</td><td>Polish letter</td><td>Typing hand</td></tr> </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td>E</td><td>Ę</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>O</td><td>Ó</td><td><b>right</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>A</td><td>Ą</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>S</td><td>Ś</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>L</td><td>Ł</td><td><b>right</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Z</td><td>Ż</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>X</td><td>Ź</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>C</td><td>Ź</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>N</td><td>Ń</td><td><b>right</b></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Now, most of these keys are in nice positions at the left edge of the keyboard,
so that one can hold the <code>AltGr</code> key with the right hand, and type the letter
key with the left. There are, however, three very uncomfortable typing positions:</p>

<h3>The Awkward <code>Ł</code></h3>

<p>The letter <code>ł</code>, once pronounced as <em>dark l</em> <code>ɫ</code>, now pronounced roughly like
the English <code>w</code>, is the most common of the Polish special letters, and
comprises ~1.80% of Polish texts. That's a lot!</p>

<p>Look how awkward it is to type:</p>

<p>This is manageable if your right Alt Key is right underneath the <code>,</code> key, where
it can be held down with the right thumb. Like on this Thinkpad keyboard:
<img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/altgr_nice.png" alt="thinkpad keyboard AltGr position"></p>

<p>It's much worse if your <code>AltGr</code> key is way out to the right, like on this old
mechanical keyboard:</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/altgr_bad.png" alt="classic keyboard AltGr position"></p>

<h3>The Odious <code>Ó</code></h3>

<p>This letter is pronounced exactly like <code>u</code>, but is used in different
grammatical contexts. That's not important, but what's important is that it
comprises roughly 0.9% of all Polish texts, so you need to type it quite often.</p>

<p>Here's its default position:</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_oogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + o key highlighted in red"></p>

<h3>The Noisome <code>Ń</code></h3>

<p>The letter <code>Ń</code> is pronounced rougly like the Spanish <code>Ñ</code>. Comprising only 0.2% of
Polish texts, it's not all that frequent, but still a pain to type.</p>

<p>The right hand must contort like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_nogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish n key highlighted in red"></p>

<h2>The Well-Placed Letters</h2>

<p>The remaining letters of the Polish alphabet are placed conveniently under the
left typing hand. Interestingly, the letter <code>Ź</code> is placed under the <code>X</code> key,
because <code>Z</code> is already occupied by the letter <code>Ż</code>.</p>

<p>Here they are, all in one happy bunch:</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_good_ogonki.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish ę,ą,ś,ż,ź,ć keys highlighted in green"></p>

<h2>Some Rearragements</h2>

<p>You might have noticed in the image above, that the <code>Q</code>, <code>W</code>, and <code>D</code> keys are
not used for typing Polish letters. Let's take advantage and complete the 3x3
square, like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_move_ogonki.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish ę,ą,ś,ż,ź,ć keys highlighted in green, ó,ł,ń keys highlighted in orange,  and arrows from ó->q, ł->w, ń->d keys"></p>

<h3>Q is an Upside-down Ó</h3>

<p>This one is easy. <code>Q</code> looks like an upside-down <code>Ó</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_oogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish ó key highlighted in red">
<img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_lefty_oogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + q key highlighted in green"></p>

<h3>W is English for Ł</h3>

<p>This one is phonetically very natural. Polish speakers are used to <code>W</code> being
pronounced like <code>Ł</code> in words of English provenance, such as <em>Whiskey</em> or
<em>Weekend</em>, so let's make it official!</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_logonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish ł key highlighted in red">
<img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_lefty_logonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + w key highlighted in green"></p>

<h3>D is Ń. Just Because</h3>

<p>The odd one out is the letter <code>ń</code>. I don't have a good justification for this,
apart from wanting to fit all the Polish letters in the leftmost 3x3 grid on
the keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_nogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish ń key highlighted in red">
<img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_lefty_nogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + d key highlighted in green"></p>

<h2>The Polish Lefty Layout</h2>

<p>And so we arrive at the following layout, which removes the awkwardness
associated with having to use the right hand for modifier key combinations.</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_lefty_ogonki.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + q,w,e,a,s,d,z,x,c keys highlighted in green"></p>

<h2>A Call for Ports</h2>

<p>If you like this layout and happen to port it to Windows or Mac OS, please
let me know and I will add it to this page.</p>

<p><em>There is a massive amount of libraries and frameworks written in PHP, providing useful functionalities, some even commercially. You may have come across libraries, such as PDF generators, the Twig templating engine, random data generators, etc. Let’s take a look at how to develop the library for both PHP and .NET, so that C# developers will be able to <em>seamlessly</em></em> <em>consume the functionality, as well.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following guide explains how to target both PHP and .NET at the same time. The same PHP code that already works will become available as a .NET library, as well. Most importantly, however, a C# developer won’t even notice the library had ever been written in PHP, nor will it matter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code {"language":"bash"} -->
<pre>dotnet add package mjaschen.phpgeo --version 3.2.0-*</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code {"language":"csharp","className":"language-csharp csharp"} -->
<pre>// "Coordinate" and "Vincenity" classes are a part of PHPGeo library which is written in PHP
// It's used in the following sample C# code:

var coordinate1 = new Coordinate(19.820664, -155.468066); // Mauna Kea Summit
var coordinate2 = new Coordinate(20.709722, -156.253333); // Haleakala Summit

Console.WriteLine(coordinate1.getDistance(coordinate2, new Vincenty());</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an example, we can take a look at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apps.peachpie.io/Item?id=mjaschen.phpgeo" target="_blank">PHPGeo</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apps.peachpie.io/" target="_blank">apps.peachpie.io</a>), which we provided as a .NET NuGet package, without any modifications to the original PHP code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a few recommended things to keep in mind when developing for both PHP and .NET. Most of the existing packages are actually following those recommendations already.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sample Library</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s create a sample library – Dogchi – that provides an instance of a dog with some actions, like the Tamagotchi. The project structure will be as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->
<pre>- src
  - dog.php
- composer.json
- dogtchi.msbuildproj</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our sample <code><strong>dog.php</strong></code> code will look like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code {"language":"csharp"} -->
<pre>&lt;?php

namespace Dogtchi;
use DateTime;

/** Our dog-tamagotchi */
class Dog {
    private $name;
    private $birth;

    function __construct(string $name) {
        $this-&gt;name = $name;
        $this-&gt;birth = new DateTime();
    }

    function feedMeat(int $amount) : void {
        // decrease hunger
    }

    function pet() : void {
        // increase happiness
    }

    /** Returns the age of dog in dog years. */
    function getAge() : int {
        return 7 * $this-&gt;birth-&gt;diff(new DateTime())-&gt;format('%y');
    }

    /**
     * Combine two dogs and get a new one!
     * @param Dog $another second dog.
     * @return Dog Their child.
     */
    function breed(Dog $another) : Dog {
        $child = new Dog($this-&gt;name . "-" . $another-&gt;name);
        //$child-&gt;color = ...
        return $child;
    }
}</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Strong Typing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most important part of the project is strong typing. In order to provide a great experience for a C# developer, type hint all the parameters and return types. This has several benefits:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The code is <strong>cleaner</strong>; obviously, your code will be self-descriptive and forces you to provide a unified and safe API. Also, the runtime will take care of the wrong parameters and NULL checks automatically.</li><li>The code editor will <strong>become smarter</strong>; your development environment can understand your code better and provide better code completion and error checking.</li><li>Finally, the provided library will have the <strong>type-information</strong>. This is important in strongly typed languages, such as C#, where every variable has to be typed. Additionally, the C# editor will understand your code and the user will benefit from the guidance IntelliSense provides – without having to read any of your documentation. </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>composer.json</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code {"language":"jscript"} -->
<pre>{
    "name": "jakubmisek/dogtchi",
    "description": "Sample Dog Tamagotchi",
    "type": "project",
    "require": {
        "php": "&gt;=5.5.0"
    },
    "license": "MIT",
    "authors": [ { "name": "Jakub Misek" } ],
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Dogtchi": "src/"
        }
    }
}</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A standard project descriptor – <code>composer.json</code> – provides various metadata. The most important part is the <code>"autoload"</code> section. In .NET, this will be used to take care of the autoloading by itself, <a href="https://www.peachpie.io/2020/05/autoloading-and-composer.html">fully handled by the compiler and runtime</a>. As a result, the C# developer who is not used to explicitly include the magic “autoload.php” script, won’t have to worry about this specific PHP behavior at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>getters and setters</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Properties in PHP are somewhat magical; they can be references, or not. They can be typed, or not. For convenience reasons, it is better to provide the get/set function, like <code>function getAge(): int</code>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>doc comments</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PHPDoc comments are well understood by everyone. When building a .NET library, all of the source code is removed, but PHPDoc comments become a part of the library and will be provided in the editor’s IntelliSense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":18925,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="309" height="103" src="https://www.peachpie.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.peachpie.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-13.png 309w, https://www.peachpie.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-13-300x100.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px"><figcaption>Sample use of the dog class in C# editor.</figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Write the doc comments on all the public functions, so that the users have their documentation where it’s most useful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>project file</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After you have written the PHP library, you are ready to target .NET with it. All of the original source code remains the same, you only have to add a project file – <code><strong>dogtchi.msbuildproj</strong></code>. Its features are described at <a href="https://docs.peachpie.io/php/msbuild/">docs.peachpie.io/php/msbuild/</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code {"language":"xml"} -->
<pre>&lt;Project Sdk="Peachpie.NET.Sdk/1.0.0-preview3"&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;OutputType&gt;library&lt;/OutputType&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;netstandard2.1&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
    &lt;GenerateDocumentationFile&gt;true&lt;/GenerateDocumentationFile&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;Compile Include="**/*.php" /&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This file is somewhat similar to the <code>composer.json</code> file, but it’s supposed to be used by the <code>dotnet</code> build tool.The important part is the <code>&lt;Compile&gt;</code> element, where you specify what is included in the resulting library.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having installed your <strong>.NET Core SDK</strong>, run the following on the command line, or “build” the project from a development environment, such as Microsoft Visual Studio. The IDE will verify whether everything is set up correctly and compiles your project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->
<pre>dotnet build</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to create a NuGet package that can be consumed by C# developers, run the following command. It builds the release version of the library and packs it into the package:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->
<pre>dotnet pack -c Release -p:Version=0.1.2

Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.8.0-preview-20451-02+51a1071f8 for .NET
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

  Determining projects to restore...
  Restored dogtchi.msbuildproj (in 445 ms).
  dogtchi -&gt; bin\Release\netstandard2.1\dogtchi.dll
  Successfully created package 'bin\Release\jakubmisek.dogtchi.0.1.2.nupkg'.</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><code>jakubmisek.dogtchi.0.1.2.nupkg</code> is the newly created NuGet package containing the library without the original source code. Basically, it is a ZIP file containing a descriptor and the library compiled into a dogtchi.dll file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Consuming the library in C#</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, to demonstrate how it looks from the C# developer’s perspective, let’s use the library in a C# project. There are two ways of consuming the package – from the sources and from the package. During the development, we choose the first option. Consuming the library from the package is for our users and customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Create a sample C# console app</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s create a sample .NET console application. In an empty folder, write the following. It creates a new C# project and adds a dependency to the PHP library project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->
<pre>dotnet new console
dotnet add reference ..\dogtchi\dogtchi.msbuildproj</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the newly created code, you are already ready to use the <code>Dog</code> class:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code {"language":"csharp"} -->
<pre>var dog = new Dog("Smurf");
dog.pet();</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":18927,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="397" src="https://www.peachpie.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dogtchi-sample.gif" alt=""></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Using the library from the package</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you deploy the package <code>dogtchi.nupkg</code> to a public NuGet feed, e.g. nuget.org or myget.org, or your private NuGet feed, like the one you can have on Azure DevOps or GitHub, you can consume the library as a package. The following command adds <code>&lt;PackageReference&gt;</code> to the C# project:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->
<pre>dotnet add package doghtchi</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to PeachPie and the .NET development toolchain, it is possible to provide virtually any PHP library or app, regardless of its size, as a single NuGet package, which is perfectly understood by the entire .NET ecosystem. Not only does this mean you can take whatever PHP application you have and distribute it for .NET developers to use, it also means you can provide your app without ever giving away its source code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means it’s now possible to sell your PHP application to the .NET world without actually providing your sources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what about web applications? For those, the process is quite different from regular console libraries – we’ll cover that in another blog post in the future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
		<p>If you are looking for a good resolution for 2020 still (I know, it’s a bit late), you can’t go wrong with this one: <em>this year, I will focus on making the networks and products I work on truly simpler. </em>Now, before you pull Tom’s take out on me—</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://networkingnerd.net/2019/12/27/fast-friday-keeping-up-with-the-times/">There are those that would say that what we’re doing is just hiding the complexity behind another layer of abstraction, which is a favorite saying of Russ White. I’d argue that we’re not hiding the complexity as much as we’re putting it back where it belongs – out of sight. We don’t need the added complexity for most operations.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Three things: <em><strong>First,</strong> complex solutions are always required for hard problems.</em> If you’ve ever listened to me talk about complexity, you’ve probably seen this quote on a slide someplace—</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://faculty.nps.edu/dlalders/docs/AldersonDoyle-tsmca-July2010.pdf">[C]omplexity is most succinctly discussed in terms of functionality and its robustness. Specifically, we argue that complexity in highly organized systems arises primarily from design strategies intended to create robustness to uncertainty in their environments and component parts.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> solve hard problems—complex problems—without complex solutions. In fact, a lot of the complexity we run into in our everyday lives is a result of saying “this is too complex, I’m going to build something simpler.” <em>(here I’m thinking of a blog post I read last year that said “when we were building containers, we looked at routing and realized how complex it was… so we invented something simpler… which, of course, turned out to be more complex than dynamic routing!)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Second,</strong> abstraction can be used the right way to manage complexity, and it can be used the wrong way to obfuscate or mask complexity.</em> The second great source of complexity and system failure in our world is we don’t abstract complexity so much as we obfuscate it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Third,</strong> abstraction is not a zero-sum game</em><strong>.</strong> If you haven’t found the tradeoffs, you haven’t looked hard enough. This is something expressed through the state/optimization/surface triangle, which you should <em>know</em> at this point.</p>
<p>Returning to the top of this post, the point is this: Using abstraction to manage complexity is fine. Obfuscation of complexity is not. Papering over complexity “just because I can” never solves the problem, any more than sweeping dirt under the rug, or papering over the old paint without bothering to fix the wall first.</p>
<p>We need to go beyond just figuring out how to make the user interface simpler, more “intent-driven,” automated, or whatever it is. We need to think of the network as a system, rather than as a collection of bits and bobs that we’ve thrown together across the years. We need to think about the modules horizontally and vertically, think about how they interact, understand how each piece works, understand how each abstraction leaks, and be able to ask hard questions.</p>
<p>For each module, we need to understand how things work well enough to ask <em>is this the right place to divide these two modules?</em> We should be willing to rethink our abstraction lines, the placement of modules, and how things fit together. Sometimes moving an abstraction point around can greatly simplify a design while increasing optimal behavior. Other times it’s worth it to reduce optimization to build a simpler mouse trap. <em>But you cannot know the answer to this question until you ask it.</em> If you’re sweeping complexity under the rug because… <em>well, that’s where it belongs…</em> then you are doing yourself and the organization you work for a disfavor, plain and simple. Whatever you sweep under the rug of obfuscation will grow and multiply. You don’t want to be around when it crawls back out from under that rug.</p>
<p>For each module, we need to learn how to ask <em>is this the right level and kind of abstraction?</em> We need to learn to ask <em>does the set of functions this module is doing really “hang together,” or is this just a bunch of cruft no-one could figure out what to do with, so they shoved it all in a black box and called it done?</em></p>
<p>Above all, we need to learn to look at the network as a system. I’ve been harping on this for so long, and yet I still don’t think people understand what I am saying a lot of times. So I guess I’ll just have to keep saying it. 😊</p>
<p>The problems networks are designed to solve are hard—therefore, networks are going to be complex. You cannot eliminate complexity, but you can learn to minimize and control it. Abstraction within a well-thought-out system is a valid and useful way to control complexity and understanding how and where to create modules at the edges of which abstraction can take place is a valid and useful way of controlling complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t obfuscate. Think systemically, think about the tradeoffs, and abstract wisely.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605368314078_14495"><div><p>On November 12, 2020 Apple released macOS Big Sur. In the hours after the release went live, somewhere in Apple's infrastructure an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder cried out in pain, dropping to its knees, begging for mercy as load increased beyond what it could handle. The OCSP responder slowing down, being a critical aspect of a modern public key infrastructure (PKI), makes it hard for clients of the PKI to verify the validity of identity documents. These documents, called X.509 Certificates, are attached to every verified application the user is launching on their Mac. Mayhem ensued, and after the issues were cleaned up, many questions remained about the implications of this failure. But first, let's take a look at the mechanisms involved in authenticating an application package, at the most fundamental level.</p>

<p>The X.509 is a ratified ITU specification that defines (among other things) a standard representation for documents that convey trust relationships between entities, known as Certificates. Certificates can be thought of as policy documents. Any X.509 certificate consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>a public key,</li>
<li>an indication who the certificate was issued for,</li>
<li>what actions the authority allows the certificate holder to perform,</li>
<li>the date the certificate is first valid on,</li>
<li>the date the certificate expires on,</li>
<li>metadata about how to check if the certificate has been revoked (optional, but highly recommended),</li>
<li>the authority who issued the certificate, and</li>
<li>a signature across all this metadata, from the authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>By retrieving the authority certificate, one can verify the integrity of the issued certificate. In fact, most authority certificates were issued by an even higher authority. By verifying all the way up to the root entity certificate (the "self-signed" highest level authority), it is possible to get a high degree of confidence of the provenance of the end entity certificate. Oftentimes a certain set of policy requirements must be met for an authority to issue a certificate to an end entity, or any intermediate entity. A certificate can be viewed as an embodiment of the proof that the authorities involved performed the appropriate checks to make sure all these conditions were met. If you fail these checks, an authority should not issue you a certificate!</p>
<p>The ceremony of creating these documents, how to interpret the document, how to represent the hierarchy of business trust decisions are all encoded in a certificate chain. Certificate chains are powerful concepts: they can be used to verify an authority who generated a public key, and who verified it was done to a certain standard. By reducing the scope of public keys to only keys you trust by specifying only certain root authorities you will accept certificate chains originating from, you can make a policy to reject any public keys (and thus any certificates) that were issued by a different authority.</p>
<h2 id="the-hard-part-revocation">The Hard Part: Revocation</h2>
<p>But what if, after the date the certificate is issued and before the date the certificate expires, something goes wrong? Maybe the authority decides that the entity the certificate was issued to has committed some malfeasance, and revokes their certificate. Sometimes the private key for a certificate is stolen, and so the assertions about who the party is that the certificate represents are no longer true, since an entity with the stolen key could impersonate the legitimate original party. There are numerous reasons why a certificate could be revoked.</p>
<p>One of the fantastic design attributes of X.509 is the fact that you should be able to perform X.509 certificate chain validation offline. So long as you have an accurate idea of what the current date is and what root entities you trust, it's (relatively) easy for a party to verify a certificate chain. The offline verification confers a great deal of resilience upon the system. But this revocation problem remains a challenge - for some systems you need to be able to check back with the authority who issued the certificate and ask "hey, is this assertion you made still valid?"</p>
<p>To solve this problem, there are three common mechanisms in use today. First, most authorities publish certificate revocation lists (CRLs). This list, signed by the issuing authority, can be periodically downloaded from a location specified in the certificate's metadata (say on a daily basis). When performing certificate validation, the locally downloaded copy of the CRL will provide a indication if a certificate has been revoked. These CRLs can get quite large though, and having to wait for the CRL to be refreshed for a revocation to take effect could be risky for certain applications. CRLs work for certain use cases, but the storage and update frequency trade-offs are significant.</p>
<p>Enter OCSP. When an authority offers an OCSP responder, the URL for the responder is also encoded in the certificate. A certificate verifier can make a call to the OCSP responder, with the serial number of the certificate to be verified. The OCSP responder checks against its database of revoked certificates. The OCSP responder will then respond with a simple "valid" or "revoked" to the query, and the calling party can then decide what to do with that information. Of course, this means that the OCSP responder can log each and every one of these queries, and build a very useful paper trail to help monitor user behaviour. This risk, along with the systemic resiliency challenges, led to a search for a middle ground.</p>
<p>The final mode is a variant on calling the OCSP responder. An OCSP responder can issue a short-lived, cryptographically signed document to a certificate holder. This document is "stapled" together with the certificate, and is sent to to the verifying party. So long as the time stamps match up, the recipient can assume (within some bounded risk) that the certificate is still valid, per the issuing authority. Of course, this approach only works for certain use cases (usually connectivity-oriented usage), but it does anonymize the certificate verifying parties.</p>
<p>Apple chose the second revocation model for app certificate verification. This mode has its benefits - revocation can be performed in real-time. So, if Apple finds that an app they issued a certificate to is actually malware, they can rapidly revoke this certificate and prevent the malware from running, even on machines it has already installed itself on. This does put a lot of policy control in Apple's hands. This is where you have to make a business decision as to whether or not you trust Apple to be benevolent or not.</p>

<p>A signed application is an interesting corner case in certificate validation. Certificates are valid for a certain range of dates. Additionally, applications don't involve (at least at launch time) any sort of exchange between a server and a client that can perform an OCSP lookup on your behalf. This limits the options we have.</p>
<p>The first problem is more nuanced than one might think. Should an application, signed at a specific point in time, be only launchable between the validity start/end dates of the certificate issued to sign the application? Probably not - this puts an artificial horizon on the application being valid, and if this is an app you paid a lot of money for, this might be frustrating. Implementation details might vary, but there is a concept of a trusted timestamp server, where a timestamp with a nonce is signed by a trusted authority. By integrating a trusted timestamp into the bundle of attributes cryptographically verified by the application launcher, we can reduce this problem to only needing to verify the app signing certificate was valid <em>at the time the bundle was signed</em>. So the current calendar date is irrelevant for determining this validity, but rather the date that has been bundled into the signed app is to be used.</p>
<p>The second problem limits your options for handling revocation. A CRL might be useful in a subset of cases - for example if large swaths of certificates are to be revoked. However, there are some concerns with this approach, beyond scalability and size of these revocation lists. One operational concern is that you could be leaking information about which certificates have been revoked, or providing insight into the revocation process. This could be exploited by malfeasant actors to game the certificate issuing process, or at least make it more obvious which certificates have been revoked and when, so malware developers could get more insight into the process, giving them an edge in "gaming the system."</p>
<p>Apple opted to solve this problem with an OCSP responder. So at every launch of an app (perhaps outside of some window where the OCSP response could be cached - I have not looked into this detail), macOS would dutifully check if the certificate used by the signer is still valid, per the OCSP responder. Of course, if macOS couldn't reach the OCSP responder, it would go about its merry way launching an app. After all, a computer needs to work offline, too.</p>

<p>An OCSP responder certainly would generate logs, as we discussed before. Those logs could contain the serial numbers of certificates that users had requested be checked, as well as the IP address of the requestor. Apple certainly has a database that maps a serial number back to the actual X.509 certificate, which then can likely be used to identify what app(s) this certificate was used to sign. The metadata about the request could likely be mapped back to who you are (through the power of AppleID, perhaps), the and the attributes of the certificate could be tied to your app store purchases (or lack thereof). Theoretically, this could be used to clamp down on piracy, private software distribution and other free use of a device.</p>
<p>But here is where we have to consider the user. I'm knee-deep in systems security problems, day-in and day-out. All these systems we interact with have become more complex than what most people (myself included) can maintain a mental model of. …</p></div></div></div>

At <a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.ladderlife.com&quot;})">Ladder</a>, our big bet is using <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://clojure.org/&quot;})">Clojure</a> for fullstack app development. Ladder's used Clojure since day 1 in 2015, and we wouldn't want it any different! In particular, Clojure's Lisp heritage, focus on pure functions and immutable data structures, unified client-server support, and superior developer experience have helped us write higher quality code faster.</p>
<p><strong>Ladder is hiring! If you're interested, please check out our job description <a href="https://grnh.se/5cebfb331us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://grnh.se/5cebfb331us&quot;})">here</a>!</strong></p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2 id="pure-functions-and-immutability">Pure functions and immutability</h2>
<p>One of the challenges with ordinary, imperative programming languages like Javascript or Python is the increasing complexity of state management. As your application grows, it becomes harder and harder to isolate where in the codebase specific changes to your application state occur. This is because with typical application architectures in those languages, any function can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29&quot;})">side effects</a> or modify incoming or global state. On the other hand, Clojure strongly emphasizes working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function&quot;})">pure functions</a> (well, if you discount I/O...) and <a href="https://clojure.org/about/state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://clojure.org/about/state&quot;})">immutable data structures</a>. A Clojure programmer must be explicit when defining and modifying mutable state - this helps minimize its usage and makes it easier to reason about.</p>
<p>Immutable data structures and pure functions also lend themselves well to concurrent programming. We rarely find ourselves worrying about locks and shared data in a multi-threaded environment, because our functions are rarely modifying shared state. And when we do, Clojure provides <code>atom</code>, a thread-safe wrapper around ordinary data structures. Behind the scenes, setting an <code>atom</code>'s value calls <code>compare-and-set!</code>. That means no fussing around with locks or mutexes and no worrying about your data changing before you modify it. With this one simple construct, Clojure removes 99% of our concurrency headaches.</p>
<h2 id="clojure-is-a-lisp">Clojure is a Lisp</h2>
<p>There are probably enough Lisp arguments on the Internet already - I'll defer to <a href="https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_lisp_is_a_good_thing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_lisp_is_a_good_thing&quot;})">Rich Hickey</a> (Clojure's creator) and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html&quot;})">Paul Graham</a> instead of adding another rehash. That said, Clojure provides some advantages over other Lisps like Common Lisp and Scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>CL only includes lists in its core language spec. Clojure introduces vectors, sets, and maps which makes reading and writing code so much less tedious. Of course Scheme has all of these except sets.</li>
<li>Clojure's core data structures are immutable which, as discussed above, makes reasoning about code, especially concurrent code, much easier.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clojure-runs-everywhere">Clojure runs everywhere</h2>
<p>Clojure provides first class support for sharing code between platforms with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals&quot;})">reader conditionals</a>. Most of our namespaces at Ladder take advantage of this and are shared across our client (Clojurescript) and server (Clojure). In fact, all of our client React code (aside from browser-specific API calls like clipboard, input handlers, etc) supports being run on the JVM. This lets us run what we call "full-stack tests" entirely within a Java process. For example, we can run full user flows like "user can accept a life insurance policy" and assert against both client and server state <strong>in the same test</strong>. The closest analogue without this superpower would be running a Selenium test against a running webserver, which introduces all sorts of potential flakiness. For more on full-stack tests, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qijWBPYkRAQ&amp;t=346s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qijWBPYkRAQ&amp;t=346s&quot;})">this talk</a> two of our engineers gave at Clojure West in 2017.</p>
<p>Clojure also provides easy <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals#_host_interop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals#_host_interop&quot;})">host interop</a> for each supported platform. This lets us leverage the full JVM (and Javascript) ecosystem. For example, we use popular Java libraries like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/&quot;})">Jetty</a>, <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients&quot;})">kafka-clients</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/tink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/google/tink&quot;})">Tink</a>, and more. On the frontend, we use React, and can easily include other Javascript libraries for analytics, error handling, and session replays.</p>
<h2 id="developer-experience">Developer experience</h2>
<p>When Iâ€™ve worked with Typescript and Python in the past, I was constantly waiting for my development server to reload. Clojure makes updating code on your local server as simple as reloading the updated namespace in your REPL. If you want, you can even <a href="https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl&quot;})">update remote, (hopefully) non-production webservers</a>! Being able to evaluate code in a REPL and have your running web server update in less than a second makes exploration and iteration on your actual backend so much faster. Instant feedback makes developers more playful and experimental. Ultimately, it helps them write better code faster.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s also super easy to run small chunks of code in the REPL. Ladder, like other Clojure shops, has a convention of documenting namespace usage with a <code>comment</code> block at the bottom. Developers can use the code within to learn the namespaceâ€™s API, run commonly used procedures, or test changes to the rest of the namespace - all without leaving their editor!</p>
<h2 id="why-not-clojure">Why not Clojure?</h2>
<p>While we're extremely satisfied with our choice of Clojure, we've had our fair share of headaches. First, Clojure processes take a long time to start up - especially as the size of the application grows. Our webserver at Ladder takes a full minute before it can accept web requests. This makes autoscaling in response to load more challenging - some of our load can spike in well under a minute, so we have to be consistently overprovisioned to handle it. Second, Clojure produces pretty big artifacts. This matters less on the backend, where our webserver JAR is over 1.5GB, but hurts us on the frontend. We still have work to do here, but our initial bundle is 7.2MB uncompressed (1.0MB gzipped)! If raw performance or bundle size is your primary concern, you might be better off choosing another language.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a small company, we have more ideas to try than we have bandwidth to implement. Using Clojure has helped our team be more iterative and more productive, so we can ship more experiments and projects than we would otherwise be able to. I feel super lucky that Ladder introduced me to Clojure - and I'm excited to see how Clojure and our use of it continues to evolve!</p>

Despite this fact, I decided to make another one. Before you roll your eyes, let me explain the reasons for making such a decision. At the end of the article, you'll find a comment on hacker news that answers the question.</p><p>First of all, let's accept the term that I consider people who are solo-founders who have enough time &amp; desire to make their products. I'm not talking about an investment of millions of dollars, complex financial calculations of risks/profits, creating a big company with hundreds of employees. I'm talking about small businesses.</p><p>Having such people in mind, let's see what their thoughts can be before starting a new product.</p><p>Most of them refuse to create something alleging that:</p><ul><li>They don't have a brilliant idea</li><li>They don't have enough money/time</li><li>The idea was already implemented / there are a lot of competitors in the area</li></ul><p>Let's examine these statements.</p><h3 id="no-brilliant-idea">No brilliant idea</h3><p>Let me ask: Does every successful product have a brilliant idea? Does every successful business have an idea at all? If so, <a href="https://alternativeto.net/">https://alternativeto.net/</a> didn't exist.</p><p>Everyone knows that idea worth nothing. Implementation does. Marketing does.</p><p>How often do we hear: "Gosh, why nobody solves this, isn't it obvious that people should solver this?!". But why the person who says that didn't solve it, if it's obvious?</p><p>Now, you may argue that new products appearing in the market have USP, Unique Selling Proposition.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>The purpose of your technical resume is to generate interview requests. A successful resume attracts more interest, from more of the companies you want to interview with, for more of the jobs you would be happy to take.</p><p>You might think of a resume as your personal summary document, covering all of your life’s work to date. But it’s better to think of your resume as a business document that helps you advertise your capabilities to a future employer.</p><p>I’ve worked with thousands of employers, published the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-recruiters-look-at-during-the-6-seconds-they-spend-on-your-resume-2012-4">ground-breaking research</a> into recruiter resume review time, and written several bestsellers on resumes and other career topics. And that’s why I’m now writing <a href="https://signup.meetleet.com/">great technical resumes for free</a>. Resumes, when done right, are great help in accelerating your career.</p><p>Here are a few things a <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-a-great-technical-resume">technical resume</a> is not:</p><ul><li>Not your autobiography</li><li>Not a comprehensive catalog of everything you’ve done</li><li>Not a way to make you feel good about yourself (though it might also do that)</li><li>Not an academic CV</li><li>Not where you need to explain past ‘bad situations’</li><li>Not where you need to explain why you left prior jobs</li></ul><p>No, a technical resume is none of those things. And that’s because none of those things help get you hired.</p><p>Instead, a technical resume’s primary purpose is to generate interview requests for you. It’s where you make the case to “please pick me out of the pile.”</p><p>(Secondarily, a resume is a useful page of notes to use during interviews, especially behavioral interviews. We all know how our minds can go blank during interviews and it’s useful to have something to aid your memory in those moments.)</p><p>What’s the best way to get a hiring manager or future boss to select your resume from the pile? </p><p>It’s to make it as clear as possible which types of problems you’ve solved in the past, and how well you solved them. With that information, hiring managers have the easiest time in predicting what you can do for them in the future.</p><p>Unfortunately, most technology professionals take the easy way out, and copy and paste their job description into their resume. As a result, their <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points</a> are full of sentences that begin “Responsible for” or “Worked on” or “Assigned to.”</p><p>This is a mistake because your future employer is not going to hire you for your past <strong>responsibilities</strong>. Rather, they will hire you for your past <strong>successes</strong>. It’s your achievements and results in technology that get you promoted and elevated to ever-higher levels.</p><p>And that’s why great technical resumes focus on results, <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">numbers</a> and method. </p><p><strong>Results</strong>: for the technology you were working on, how did it make your company, team, or systems better? Did it increase, decrease, grow, shrink, improve, suppress, optimize, deprecate, add or remove something important for your company? For everything you’ve worked on, there was some reason you were doing it. Hopefully, that reason had to do with making things better. Share the result with your resume readers. </p><p><strong>Numbers</strong>: by how much did you make things better? As a technology professional, you’re used to numbers. We measure the success of what we do in numbers all the time: latency, loadtime, DAUs, Google score. Using numbers to describe the work you’ve done comes naturally in the field.</p><p>So the more you can use numbers to <strong>quantify</strong> how much you helped increase, decrease, grow, shrink, etc., the important metrics in your prior roles, the better and more persuasive your resume will be in getting picked out of the pile. </p><p><strong>Method</strong>: this is the technical “how I did it” part of a great technical resume. If you increased something by 50% what technologies or solutions or methodologies did you use to get there? If you shrank a different metric by 70%, what activities or behaviors or actions did you need to take to achieve this reduction?</p><p>Many technical resumes miss the results and the numbers and only list the method of how they did something. Unfortunately, that’s not as effective at attracting attention to get your resume picked out of the pile.</p><p>To demonstrate, the <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points</a> below <strong>with</strong> <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">numbers</a> are much more powerful than the same bullet point <strong>without</strong> numbers.</p><ul><li>Responsible for for managing our AWS cloud services for cost, reliability and scalability.</li><li>Reduced costs 17% by decommissioning 42 ec2 instances in our AWS implementation while managing for costs, reliability and scalability.</li></ul><ul><li>Refactored our front/end experience using React.</li><li>Increased user engagement 27% by refactoring our front-end experience in React.</li></ul><p>Combining results, numbers and methods on your resume makes your experience stand out from the pile.

<![CDATA[H.264 Specification Sucks]]>

November 14, 2020 | https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2020/11/h-264-specification-sucks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2020/11/h-264-specification-sucks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>So it has come to a stage where I have nothing better to do so I tried to write H.264 decoder for <code>NihAV</code> (so I can test the future <code>nihav-player</code> with the content beside just sample files and cutscenes from various games). And while I’ve managed to decode at least something (more about that in the end) the specification for H.264 <em>sucks</em>. Don’t get me wrong, the format by itself is not that bad in design but the way it’s documented is far from being good (though it’s still serviceable—it’s not an audio codec after all).</p>
<p>And in the beginning to those who want to cry “but it’s <del>GNU/Linux</del>, err, MPEG/AVC”. ITU H.264 was standardised in May 2003 while MPEG-4 Part 10 came in December 2003. Second, I can download ITU specification freely and various editions too while MPEG standard still costs money I’m not going to pay.</p>
<p>I guess the main problems of H.264 come from two things: dual coding nature (i.e. slice data can be coded using variable-length codes or binary arithmetic coder) and extensions (not as bad as H.263 but approaching it; and here’s a simple fact to demonstrate it—2003 edition had 282 pages, 2019 edition has 836 pages). Plus the fact that is codified<a href="https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2016/05/on-variable-length-codes-names/"> the wrong name for Elias gamma’ codes</a> I ranted on before.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the extensions part since most of them can be ignored and I don’t have much to say about them except for one thing—profiles. By itself the idea is good: you have certain set of constraints and features associated with the ID so you know in advance if you should be able to handle the stream or not. And the initial 2003 edition had three profiles (baseline/main/extended) with IDs associated with them (66, 77 and 88 correspondingly). By 2019 there have been a dozen of various profiles and even more profile IDs and they’re not actually mapped one to one (e.g. constrained baseline profile is baseline profile with an additional <code>constraint_set1_flag</code> set to one). In result you have lots of random profile IDs (can you guess what <code>profile_idc</code> 44 means? and 86? or 128?) and they did not bother to make a table listing all known profile IDs so you need to search all specification is order to find out what they mean. I’d not care much but they affect bitstream parsing, especially sequence parameter set where they decided to insert some additional fields in the middle for certain high profiles.</p>
<p>Now the more exciting part: coding. While I understand the rationale (you have simpler and faster or slower but more effective (de)coding mode while using the same ways to transform data) it created some problems for describing it. Because of that decision you have to look at three different places in order to understand what and how to decode: syntax tables in 7.3 which present in which order and under which conditions elements are coded, semantics in 7.4 telling you what that element actually means and what limitations or values it has, and 9.2 or 9.3 for explanations on how certain element should be actually decoded from the bitstream. And confusingly enough coded block pattern is put into 9.1.2 while it would be more logical to join it with 9.2, as 9.1 is for parsing generic codes used not just in slice data but various headers as well and 9.2 deals with parsing custom codes for non-CABAC slice data.</p>
<p>And it gets even worse for CABAC parsing. For those who don’t know what it is, that abbreviation means context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding. In other words it represents various values as sequences of bits and codes each bit using its own context. And if you ask yourself how the values are represented and which contexts are used for each bit then you point right at the problem. In the standard you have it all spread in three or four places: one table to tell you which range of contexts to use for a certain element, some description or separate table for the possible bit strings, another table or two to tell you which contexts should be used for each bit in various cases (e.g. for <code>ctxIdxOffset</code>=36 you have these context offsets for following bits: 0, 1, (2 or 3), 3, 3, 3), and finally an entry that tells you how to select a context for the first bit if it depends on already decoded data (usually by checking if top and left (macro)blocks have the same thing coded or not). Of course it’s especially fun when different bit contexts are reused for different bit positions or the same bit positions can have different contexts depending on previously decoded bit string (this happens mostly for macroblock types in P/SP/B-slices but it’s still confusing). My guess is that they tried to optimise the total number of contexts and thus merged the least used ones. In result you about 20 pages of context data initialisation in the 2019 edition (in initial edition of both H.264 and H.EVC it’s just eight pages)—compare that to almost hundred pages of default CDFs in AV1 specification. And CABAC part in H.265 is somehow much easier to comprehend (probably because they made the format less dependent on special bit strings and put some of the simpler conditions straight into binarisation table).</p>
<p>To me it seems that people describing CABAC coding (not the coder itself but rather how it’s used to code data) did not understand it well themselves (or at least could not convey the meaning clearly). And despite the principle of documenting format from decoder point of view (i.e. what bits should it read and how to act on them in order to decode bitstream) a lot of CABAC coding is documented from encoder point of view (i.e. what bits you should <em>write</em> for syntax element instead of what <em>reading</em> certain bits would produce). An egregious example of that is so-called UEGk binarisation. In addition to the things mentioned above it also has rather meaningless parameter name <code>uCoff</code> (which normally would be called something like escape value). How would I describe decoding it: read truncated unary sequence up to <code>escape_len</code>, if the read value is equal to <code>escape_len</code> then read an additional escape value as exp-Golomb code shifted by <code>k</code> and trailing <code>k</code>-bit value, otherwise escape value is set to zero. Add escape value to the initial one and if the value is non-zero and should be signed, read the sign. Section 9.2.3.2 spends a whole page on it with a third of it being C code for writing the value.</p>
<p>I hope I made it clear why H.264 specification sucks in my opinion. Again, the format itself is logical but comprehending certain parts of the specification describing it takes significantly more time than it should and I wanted to point out why. It was still possible to write a decoder using mostly the specification and referring to other decoders source code only when it was completely unclear or worked against expectations (and JM is still not the best codebase to look at either, HM got much better in that aspect).</p>
<p>P.S. For those zero people who care about <code>NihAV</code> decoder, I’ve managed to decode two random videos downloaded from BaidUTube (funny how one of them turned out to be simple CAVLC-coded video with no B-frames) without B-frames and without apparent artefacts in first hundred frames. There’s still <em>a lot</em> of work to make it decode data correctly (currently it lacks even loop filter and probably still has bugs) plus beside dreaded B-frames with their co-located MVs there are still some features like 8×8 DCTs or high-bitdepth support I’d like to have (but definitely no interlaced support or scalable/multiview shit). It should be good enough to play content I care about and that’s all, I do not want to waste extremely much time making it a perfect software that supports all possible H.264/AVC features and being the fastest one too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" id="item-5f874104a7228719beb6a67c"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-30d8fede11f47c2dce9d"><div><p>A big challenge for most early-stage startups is developing a clear Go-To-Market (GTM for short) strategy for growth and success. Early in a companies life, the value-prop and ideal customer can be murky and being resource and cash strapped, most startup will grab any customer that comes their way. We wanted to discuss some simple tips startups and founders can do with their revenue/billing data to help unearth insights that can help direct your GTM game plan.</p><p>The first thing you can easily do is go into your billing/subscription system (<a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.zuora.com/" target="_blank">Zuora</a>, etc.) and analyze your revenue retention. Revenue retention is the amount of revenue still being paid by an initial group of customers (ie, all the new customers you landed in July or everyone that is a software company). Say to start they paid you $10,000 in MRR back in July and now in October they are paying you $9,200 in MRR then their <a href="https://talkinsaasy.com/saasy-math" target="_blank">Net Revenue Retention</a> would be 92%. Some billing/subscription management systems can perform these calculations for you though they usually only can do it for your entire customer base as a whole which can be misleading.</p><p>An easy work around is to pull the data into excel or google sheets and just go through it a group customer by certain characteristics like we discussed above. If you are early-stage (less than 1,000 customers) this should be easy enough to do manually, you can do some analytics on it using SQL if you have someone with the requisite skill sets on your team. Once you have a few defined characteristics (customer segments) you can then go through your monthly billing data and see how much those groups are still paying over a period of time. Then look across these groups and see which ones have the best Net Retention, ideally you would like to find a group with retention &gt;100% but for early-stage companies still finding product-market fit it is ok if you don’t just yet.</p><p>Once you have identified the best group or two, take a look at their customer journey, which channels did they come in through, what products/services did they buy initially and did they add additional products or units after their initial purchase? These are all clues to help you uncover a clear go-to-market plan. Say most of your leads came in via marketing buys, and bought a certain product to start and then expanded to another feature later shows you the value-props they are finding as a customer, so you can start putting that message into your marketing messaging. Once you identify that group, mapping that journey will reveal to you their GTM experience with your brand and allow you to emulate it moving forward.</p><p>Starting with billing data is an easy way for an early-stage startup to segment their customers and find their top performers. From there a review of their customer journey and you find yourself with a pretty nice roadmap for a GTM strategy. If you and your team are working on a GTM strategy and you want to chat more with me about how you can use billing and other data to help uncover customer insights, shoot me and <a href="mailto:ross.andrews543@gmail.com?subject=Data%20Driven%20GTM%20Strategy">email</a> and mention this post!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Serverless</strong> is a scalable, fast and reliable architecture for APIs. By deploying your API to cloud providers such as <strong>AWS</strong>, you don't have to think about server administration, you just focus on code. Using the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless framework</a>, it becomes really easy as you can deploy a <strong>Lambda function</strong> in seconds.  </p>
<p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a query language simplifying client-server interactions. It's also very efficient thanks to its declarative data fetching. It's no surprise that <a href="https://github.blog/2016-09-14-the-github-graphql-api/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/evolving-the-graph-4c587a4ad9a8">Coursera</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-is-moving-10x-faster-at-scale-with-graphql-and-apollo-aa4ec92d69e2">AirBnB</a> are using it.</p>
<p>Today we're going to bring the best of both worlds, by building a <strong>Serverless</strong> <strong>GraphQL</strong> API and deploy it to <strong>AWS</strong> !</p>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup the <strong>Serverless</strong> framework</li>
<li>Test the Lambda locally</li>
<li>Setup <strong>GraphQL</strong> with <strong>Apollo Server</strong></li>
<li>Manage data through <strong>DynamoDB</strong></li>
<li>Deploy the Lambda to <strong>AWS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The full code of this tutorial is <a href="https://github.com/LucasLeRay/serverless-graphql-api-boilerplate">available on GitHub</a>, feel free to use it for your next project ! It's a more complete version, with <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>ESLint</strong> and <strong>Prettier</strong>.  </p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To use the <strong>Serverless</strong> framework and deploy to <strong>AWS</strong>, you have to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/">Setup an AWS account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html">Install the AWS CLI</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html">configure it</a></li>
<li>Install the <strong>Serverless</strong> framework: <code>yarn global add serverless</code></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Setup the Serverless framework</h2>
<p>First, init your <strong>Node.JS</strong> project:</p>

<p>Then, add the <strong>Serverless</strong> configuration in <code>serverless.yml</code>:</p>
<div data-language="yml"><pre><code><span>service</span><span>:</span> serverless<span>-</span>api<span>-</span>example 

<span>provider</span><span>:</span>
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> aws 
  <span>runtime</span><span>:</span> nodejs12.x
  <span>versionFunctions</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span> 
  <span>region</span><span>:</span> us<span>-</span>east<span>-</span><span>1</span> 
  <span>apiGateway</span><span>:</span>
    <span>shouldStartNameWithService</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>

<span>functions</span><span>:</span>
  <span>graphql</span><span>:</span>
    <span>handler</span><span>:</span> src/graphql.handler 
    <span>events</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>http</span><span>:</span>
          <span>path</span><span>:</span> graphql 
          <span>method</span><span>:</span> any 
          <span>cors</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span> </code></pre></div>
<h6>The full list of options is in the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml/">Serverless framework documentation</a></h6>
<p>We gave <strong>Serverless</strong> instructions to deploy our new service <code>serverless-api-example</code>. It has a Lambda called <code>graphql</code> and is accessible at <code>/graphql</code> through HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Let's create the handler for our Lambda, for the moment put the following in <code>src/graphql.js</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>exports<span>.</span><span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'wow such api'</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<h2>Test a Serverless function in local</h2>
<p>I recommend you to install the <code>serverless-offline</code> plugin to test your Lambda locally:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>yarn</span> <span>add</span> -D serverless-offline</code></pre></div>
<p>Add this at the end of <code>serverless.yml</code>:</p>
<div data-language="yml"><pre><code><span>plugins</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> serverless<span>-</span>offline</code></pre></div>
<p>And this script in <code>package.json</code>:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  ...
  <span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"start"</span><span>:</span> <span>"sls offline"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, enter <code>yarn start</code> and go to <code>localhost:3000/dev/graphql</code>:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> <span>yarn</span> start

offline: <span>[</span>HTTP<span>]</span> server ready: http://localhost:3000 🚀
offline: ANY /dev/graphql <span>(</span>λ: graphql<span>)</span>


wow such api </code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we created our Lambda, let's code its behavior !</p>

<h2>Setup a GraphQL Lambda with Apollo Server</h2>
<p><code>apollo-server-lambda</code> is a great way to build a <strong>GraphQL</strong> API in <strong>Serverless</strong>. Add it to your project:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>yarn</span> <span>add</span> -D apollo-server-lambda</code></pre></div>
<p>Define the <strong>GraphQL</strong> schema in <code>src/schema.graphql</code>:</p>
<div data-language="graphql"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Query</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>item</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Item
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Mutation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>createItem</span><span>(</span><span>content</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Item
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Item</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span>
  <span>content</span><span>:</span> String
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the schema, We're defining what's an <code>Item</code>: an entity containing <code>id</code> and <code>content</code>. We also define a mutation <code>createItem</code>, which creates an item from a <code>content</code>, and a query <code>item</code> which gets it from an <code>id</code>. </p>
<p>Now, add the following in <code>src/graphql.js</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> fs <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'fs'</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> ApolloServer<span>,</span> gql <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'apollo-server-lambda'</span><span>)</span>


<span>const</span> schema <span>=</span> fs<span>.</span><span>readFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>'./src/schema.graphql'</span><span>,</span> <span>'utf8'</span><span>)</span>


<span>const</span> resolvers <span>=</span> <span>{</span> 
  Query<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

  Mutation<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>createItem</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> server <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ApolloServer</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> typeDefs<span>:</span> schema<span>,</span> resolvers <span>}</span><span>)</span>


exports<span>.</span>handler <span>=</span> server<span>.</span><span>createHandler</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This code will create an <strong>Apollo</strong> server and return a response, using the <code>schema</code> and the <code>resolvers</code>. You can test it in <code>localhost:3000/dev/graphql</code>:
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-serverless-graphql-api/2.png" alt="Apollo server test"></p>
<p>As you can see, it works ! But our resolvers don't do anything, that's why <code>item</code> is null.
The next step is to use real data from a database.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Get data from DynamoDB with GraphQL</h2>
<p>I recommend using <strong>AWS DynamoDB</strong> as a database because it's very easy to setup with <code>serverless.yml</code>. Add the following to the existing configuration:</p>
<div data-language="yml"><pre><code><span>provider</span><span>:</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>:</span>
    <span>ITEM_TABLE</span><span>:</span> $<span>{</span>self<span>:</span>service<span>}</span><span>-</span>items<span>-</span>$<span>{</span>self<span>:</span>provider.stage<span>}</span> 
  <span>iamRoleStatements</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>Effect</span><span>:</span> Allow 
      <span>Action</span><span>:</span>
        <span>-</span> dynamodb<span>:</span>GetItem 
        <span>-</span> dynamodb<span>:</span>PutItem
      <span>Resource</span><span>:</span> <span>'arn:aws:dynamodb:${opt:region, self:provider.region}:*:table/${self:provider.environment.ITEM_TABLE}'</span>

<span>resources</span><span>:</span>
  <span>Resources</span><span>:</span>
    <span>ItemsTable</span><span>:</span> 
      <span>Type</span><span>:</span> <span>'AWS::DynamoDB::Table'</span>
      <span>Properties</span><span>:</span>
        <span>AttributeDefinitions</span><span>:</span>
          <span>-</span> <span>AttributeName</span><span>:</span> itemId
            <span>AttributeType</span><span>:</span> S
        <span>KeySchema</span><span>:</span>
          <span>-</span> <span>AttributeName</span><span>:</span> itemId
            <span>KeyType</span><span>:</span> HASH
        <span>ProvisionedThroughput</span><span>:</span>
          <span>ReadCapacityUnits</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
          <span>WriteCapacityUnits</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
        <span>TableName</span><span>:</span> $<span>{</span>self<span>:</span>provider.environment.ITEM_TABLE<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We are asking Serverless to create a new table for <code>items</code> and to give the Lambda the permissions to interact with it. More infos on the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/dynamodb">Serverless documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Now we can interact with our new <strong>DynamoDB</strong> table through the <code>aws-sdk</code>:</p>

<p>All that remains is to update our resolvers. I recommend you to declare resolvers in different files, as it'll be more maintainable.
Here's our new <code>item</code> query:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>AWS</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'aws-sdk'</span><span>)</span>

<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>item</span><span>(</span><span>_<span>,</span> <span>{</span> id <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> dynamoDb <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AWS<span>.</span>DynamoDB<span>.</span>DocumentClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  <span>const</span> params <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    TableName<span>:</span> process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>ITEM_TABLE</span><span>,</span>
    Key<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      itemId<span>:</span> id<span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> Item <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> dynamoDb<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>params<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>promise</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>Item<span>,</span>
    id<span>:</span> Item<span>.</span>itemId<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then our new <code>createItem</code> mutation:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>AWS</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'aws-sdk'</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> v4 <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'uuid'</span><span>)</span>

<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>createItem</span><span>(</span><span>_<span>,</span> <span>{</span> content <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> dynamoDb <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AWS<span>.</span>DynamoDB<span>.</span>DocumentClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> id <span>=</span> <span>v4</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  <span>const</span> params <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    TableName<span>:</span> process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>ITEM_TABLE</span><span>,</span>
    Item<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      itemId<span>:</span> id<span>,</span>
      content<span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>await</span> dynamoDb<span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span>params<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>promise</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    content<span>,</span>
    id<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, we need to install <code>uuid</code> to generate an id for new <code>items</code>:</p>

<p>Your API is ready ! Let's deploy it to AWS.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Deploy an AWS Lambda with serverless framework</h2>
<p>Deploy your new Lambda to <strong>AWS</strong> is one command away:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> serverless deploy

Serverless: Stack update finished<span>..</span>.
endpoints: 
  ANY - https://okak59wk56.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/graphql</code></pre></div>
<p>Anyone can now access your API (since you configured CORS this way). <a href="https://okak59wk56.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/graphql">Here's my version</a>.<br>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>If you’ve had a Pokemon GO phase or been fooled by that PS5 AR filter on Instagram, you’ve seen augmented reality in action.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p>With AR technology accessible to us on our mobile devices, it’s no news that we can now virtually see what makeup looks like on us, or which furniture would look good in our homes with apps like <a href="https://www.ikea.com/au/en/customer-service/mobile-apps/say-hej-to-ikea-place-pub1f8af050"><span>IKEA Place</span></a> and <a href="https://giphy.com/apps/giphyworld"><span>GIPHY World</span></a>.</p>
<p>That’s the AR that most people know, where digital input is projected onto physical dimensions through a device's camera and responds to real time changes. But did you know this process could be reversed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can now bring physical objects into the digital world instead.</p>
<h2><strong>As Easy as Clip and Drop</strong></h2>
<p>A while ago in October, this <a href="https://twitter.com/cyrildiagne/status/1319262984523448323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1319262984523448323%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fentertainment%2Fhow-to-use-viral-copy-and-paste-app-clip-drop-1438367%2F"><span>tweet</span></a> by software designer Cyril Diagne caught the attention of many. In the video he posted, a user seamlessly “copies” and “pastes” physical objects into a computer screen with the <a href="https://clipdrop.co/"><span>ClipDrop</span></a> app.</p>
<p>People were blown away by how simple the process was. Gone are the days we had to manually capture, transfer, and remove backgrounds on Photoshop. It all happens within seconds now.</p>

<p>With this AR Copy Paste app, users are able to:<br>1. Clip surrounding objects with their mobile phones and paste them into another device on the same network.<br>2. Extract objects, people, drawings and text with a simple point and tap.<br>3. Instantly extract desktop objects and drop them to any other app. <br>4. Save cutouts to cloud for future use.</p>
<h2><strong>How the App Works</strong></h2>
<p>What goes behind the screen when you “copy” an object and “paste”? Diagne and Blanchet’s app uses patented and open source technologies to perform the two most important functions of the app — clipping and dropping.</p>
<h3><strong>Copying with BASNet</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Qin_BASNet_Boundary-Aware_Salient_Object_Detection_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf"><span>Boundary-Aware Salient Object Detection</span></a> (BASNet), a predict-refine architecture, is what detects, isolates and extracts the subjects you point your camera at.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Composed of an Encoder-Decoder network in charge of saliency prediction and a residual refinement module that handles saliency map refinement, this new hybrid loss effectively segments salient object regions and predicts fine structures with clear boundaries.</p>
<h3><strong>Pasting with SIFT</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/da/df5/tutorial_py_sift_intro.html"><span>Scale-Invariant Feature Transform</span></a> (SIFT), a patented algorithm on OpenCV, then enables the app to match the coordinates on your mobile phone with those on your desktop, and finally place extracted objects in specific positions on your computer screen.</p>
<p>For this to happen, the algorithm involves multiple steps: Scale-space construction, keypoint localization, orientation assignment, keypoint descriptor, and finally keypoint matching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re interested to go deeper, <a href="https://aishack.in/tutorials/sift-scale-invariant-feature-transform-introduction/"><span>AI Shack</span></a> and <a href="https://medium.com/data-breach/introduction-to-sift-scale-invariant-feature-transform-65d7f3a72d40"><span>Data Breach</span></a> go very much into detail about each step of the process.</p>

<p>ClipDrop beta is available on Android, iOS, macOS and Windows, currently offering 30 days of free cloud storage and 10 free clips.</p>
<p>Although this is just the beginning of AR innovation, I think we can all agree that this little peek is enough to give us an idea of how unimaginable the future of advanced technology is.</p>

<p>Apple was always touted as having the more user-friendly computer. At a high level, they aren’t any different than PCs. You click around, install software, plug in some hardware, configure some system preferences and download programs from wherever you want. Macs have a few less buttons and subjectively prettier UI – which I guess lends to its ease of use. However, from Grandma’s point of view, it’s not much easier to use than a PC. There are lots of confusing icons, menus, and tiny text. Click the wrong thing, open the wrong app – how do you get back? Grandma is lost. In the end, it’s still hard to use for the layman.</p>
<p>I’d often wonder, in 50 years will everyone be a computer expert? A lot of our parents were around before 8-Tracks existed. So, it makes sense that understanding USB, HDMI, Gmail, or Playstation is not second nature. In 50 years, will Moms know how to get rid of spyware and install a new harddrive?* Will the general population’s knowledge of computers increase? Then I thought of cars which were a technical marvel at one point. Nowadays, most people have no idea how their car works but if they’re lucky, they can change the oil themselves.</p>
<p>Back to Apple. When iPad rumors were floating around, a lot of people were thinking it would be a tablet with OS X and USB ports and expandability and good times – like a “real” computer. Then it launched and Jobs was so excited to show us it ran iOS and had access to the App Store. Something clicked in my mind when that happened. I knew that when you own a Mac (I don’t) you pay the Apple Tax. You pay for more software, you pay for over-priced accessories and you pay to buy a new computer every year or two because of Apple’s slowing-dripping must-have features. We always knew Jobs was a control freak and perfectionist. However, Jobs’ want for total control was never as clear as it was when the iPad launched with iOS and the AppStore.</p>
<p>Apple doesn’t want you use your computer to control an <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.arduino.cc/');" href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, write custom printer drivers, run a game server or control your house lights. They want you to shut up and consume. Us nerds? We’re fine with our Space Station Control computers. But everyone else? Apple wants them to have their iPad, bag of Cheetos and credit card handy. You want to watch 30 Rock on your iPad? Apple gets 30%. You want to buy the latest BedazzleMyAngryBirdGemLoop game? Apple get 30% and could not be happier.</p>
<p>But let’s not get carried away. Everyone still has their Mac laptops and towers and they’re free to do what they want with them – for now. Apple’s <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.engadget.com/2010/10/20/app-store-for-os-x-unveiled/');" href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/20/app-store-for-os-x-unveiled/">announcement </a> yesterday signifies another big leap forward in the controlling and dumbing down of consumer computers. The AppStore will now be running right on your lovely desktops and laptops! Please <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.slashgear.com/firefox-director-says-apple-is-looking-to-bypass-the-web-21109568/');" href="http://www.slashgear.com/firefox-director-says-apple-is-looking-to-bypass-the-web-21109568/">do not go elsewhere</a> for software. AppStore software is safe and Steve-Certified. Stop going on the internet. Stop visiting websites. Just get the app, pay for the subscription and live merrily. Can you see where this is going? Really, the majority of computers <i>should</i> be running something like iOS and us nerds should have our super-computers. The problem is that Apple is in control and what can that mean? </p>
<p>Firstly, I think it means Apple could shift towards selling desktops with iOS – this is all the functionality that most people need. The rest of you, you’ll have to pay for an expensive “developer” or “professional” computer and a license to be in the “professional” program to have your open OS X operating system. Your computer will also cost a lot more because you’re a professional. So Apple can bump up the profit margin that it once lost because of the commodification of fast computers.</p>
<p>Second is the problem that <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=2878');" href="http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=2878">Bit-101</a> brings up. The AppStore will be the defacto place to go to get any software. You know Apple will promote the shit out of it. Your new mac with have a Safari icon, an iTunes AppStore icon and an icon of Steve Jobs’ head that will tell you want to eat for lunch (and he gets 30% for the referral). So now, as a developer, if you want to sell your software it better be in the AppStore. If not, Mom will never find it and Mom wouldn’t trust it if she did. So, please pony up $99 for Apple’s developer program and start learning Objective C. Well, since you’re now in the AppStore – how does your app work on the iPad? The iPhone? The iPod touch? (What was Jobs saying about <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/10/18/apple.earnings/');" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/10/18/apple.earnings/">fragmentation</a>?) Better go buy all 3. Jobs loves fragmentation if it means you have to buy all his devices.</p>
<p>So, while I don’t like Apple’s general direction, I do think that an iOS-like OS is great for consumer computers. I’m just not sure it’s great for the rest of us and everyone’s wallets when Apple is in control.</p>
<p>*We probably won’t have spyware or harddrives in 50 years, eh?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This week, I want to talk about the discipline of military history: what it is, why it is important and how I see my own place within it.  This is going to be a bit of an unusual collections post as it is less about the past itself and more about how we study the past; it is also going to be a bit unusual in that it is mostly my own personal reflections, rather than a historical argument.</p>



<p>We do quite a lot of different kinds of history here on the blog.  There is a fair bit of<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/09/07/new-acquisitions-class-status-and-the-early-church/"> social history,</a> some <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/05/collections-a-trip-through-thucydides-fear-honor-and-interest/">intellectual </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/12/collections-a-trip-through-cicero-natural-law/">history</a>, just a<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/20/new-acquisitions-elective-monarchy-and-the-future-of-westeros/"> little bit of political history</a> and an absolute <a href="https://acoup.blog/tag/organic-economy/"><em>ton</em> of economic history</a>.  Obviously, I think all of those analytical lenses (and several I have not done, of course) are very important ways of understanding the past.  But a lot of what we discuss on the blog fits, narrowly or broadly, into the realm of <strong>military history</strong>.  And I want to talk about that.</p>



<p><strong>Now I should note that I do not consider myself purely a military historian</strong> – indeed, in my experience, few historians are ‘pure’ anything and if you narrow down their specialization enough, you simply end up with, “I am a historian of things which interest me” followed by a long list of what those are.  <strong>I see myself as both an economic and military historian (of the Mediterranean world, broadly construed)</strong> and my research tends to exist in the places where those two strands meet.  Sometimes that means processes that read as non-military (if it isn’t evident I have active research projects on farming and metal production, you haven’t been here long!) and sometimes those projects are more narrowly military.  <strong>I am a firm believer that a historian must be prepared to use whatever tools are going to provide the best answers to their research questions</strong>; for my own work, that has included (basic) statistical analysis, textual close reading, economic theory, archaeology (both traditional and experimental), social history, and even some chemistry and physics.  Whatever works!  But certainly, the methods of military history are one tool in my toolbox, even when I am looking to answer questions about non-military aspects of Mediterranean antiquity.</p>



<p><strong>It is no real secret that as a discipline, military history is sometimes held in low regard by other historians</strong>.  There are a number of reasons for this.  Often it has to do with outdated views on what military history <em>is</em> and what military historians <em>do</em>.  Frequently military history, because it has a large enthusiast and amateur audience, is regarded as an amateur field (something which is not helped by publishers who push quite out reams of quite frankly substandard works of this sort) lacking in sophistication, which is not accurate, but often believed.  And perhaps most often, in my experience, <strong>these opinions serve as cover for a deeper conviction that studying militaries and warfare is icky and only done by people who <em>like</em> war</strong> (when I was a student, this opinion when it was expressed by a certain generation of scholars, now mostly retired, came with a <em>very</em> predictable dose of Vietnam-era anti-military sentiment).  Often it seems the study of military history is neglected by other historians precisely because they find the subject matter uncomfortable.</p>



<p>So I want to talk about three major things here: what military history actually is and how it is done these days, why we should study military history and finally what my experience of being a military historian (both as a scholar and a teacher) has been, particularly given that I am a life-long civilian.  </p>

<h2>What is Military History?</h2>



<p>The popular conception of military history – indeed, the conception sometimes shared even by other historians – is that it is fundamentally a field about charting the course of armies, describing ‘great battles’ and praising the ‘strategic genius’ of this or that ‘great general.’  One of the more obvious examples of this assumption – and the contempt it brings – comes out of the popular CrashCourse youtube series.  When asked by their audience to cover military history related to their coverage of <em>the American Civil War</em>, the response was <a href="https://youtu.be/25HHVDOaGeE">this video listing battles </a>and reflecting on the pointless of the exercise, as if a list of battles was all that military history was (the same series would later say that military historians <a href="https://youtu.be/rlx6ur_D51s?t=323">don’t talk about about food</a>, a truly baffling statement given the important of logistics studies to the field; certainly in my own subfield, military historians tend to talk about food more than any other kind of historian except for dedicated food historians).</p>



<p>The term for works of history in this narrow mold – all battles, campaigns and generals – is <strong>“drums and trumpets” history, a term generally used derisively</strong>.  The study of battles and campaigns emerged initially as a form of training for literate aristocrats preparing to be officers and generals; it is little surprise that they focused on aristocratic leadership as the primary cause for success or failure.  Consequently, the old ‘drums and trumpets’ histories also had a tendency to<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/"> glory in war </a>and to glorify commanders for their ‘genius’ although this was by no means universal and works of history on conflict as far back as Thucydides and Herodotus (which is to say, as far back as there have been any) have reflected on the destructiveness and tragedy of war.  But military history, like any field, matured over time; I should note that it is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/07/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiia-by-the-princess-irulan/">hardly the only field of history to have less respectable roots</a> in <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/14/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiib-myths-of-the-atreides/">its quite recent past</a>.  Nevertheless, as the field matured and moved beyond military aristocrats working to emulate older, more successful military aristocrats into a field of scholarly inquiry (still often motivated by the very real concern that officers and political leaders be prepared to lead in the event of conflict) the field has become far more sophisticated and its gaze has broadened to include not merely non-aristocratic soldiers, but non-soldiers more generally.</p>



<p>Instead of the ‘great generals’ orientation of ‘drums and trumpets,’ the field has moved in the direction of three major analytical lenses, laid out quite ably by Jeremy Black in “Military Organisations and Military Charge in Historical Perspective” (<em>JMH</em>, 1998). <strong> He sets out the three basic lenses as technological, social and organizational, which speak to both the questions being asked of the historical evidence but also the answers that are likely to be provided</strong>.  I should note that these lenses are mostly (though not entirely) about <em>academic</em> military history; much of the amateur work that is done is still very much ‘drums and trumpets’ (as is the occasional <em>deeply frustrating</em> books from some older historians we need not discuss here), although that is of course not to say that there isn’t good military history being written by amateurs or that all good military history narrowly follows these schools.  <strong>This is a classification system, not a straight-jacket and I am giving it here because it is a useful way to present the complexity and sophistication of the field as it is, rather than how it is imagined by those who do not engage with it.</strong></p>



<p>(I should note that <em>campaign studies</em> have not been entirely abandoned either.  What distinguishes the modern campaign or battle study from the old ‘drums and trumpets’ style is a broader use of historical causality that reaches beyond just upper-level command decisions. <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/30/fireside-friday-october-30-2020/"> Our recent recommendation, <em>Shattered Sword</em></a> is a good example of how what might have been a ‘drums and trumpets’ narrative of admirals and captains can instead be developed, using more sophisticated historical methods, into a much more complete and compelling historical argument about organizations, doctrines, technologies and so on.  And of course campaign histories will never go out of style – they are the essential foundation on which all other kinds of analysis must be laid)</p>



<p><strong>The technological approach is perhaps the least in fashion these days</strong>, but Geoffery Parker’s <em>The Military Revolution</em> (2nd ed. 1996) provides an almost pure example of the lens.  This approach tends to see changing technology – not merely military technologies, but often also civilian technologies – as the main motivator of military change (and also success or failure for states caught in conflict against a technological gradient).  <strong>Consequently, historians with this focus are often asking questions about how technologies developed, why the developed in certain places, and what their impacts were</strong>.  Another good example of the field, for instance, is the debate about the impact of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0700623833/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">rifled muskets</a> in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/171985727X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">American Civil War</a>.  While there has been a real drift away from seeing technologies themselves as decisive on their own (and thus a drift away from mostly ‘pure’ technological military history) in recent decades, this sort of history is very often paired with the others, looking at the ways that social structures, organizational structures and technologies interact.</p>



<p><strong>Perhaps the <em>most</em> popular lens for military historians these days is the social one</strong>, which used to go by the “new military history” (<em>decades </em>ago – it was the standard form even back in the 1990s) but <strong>by this point comprises probably the bulk of academic work on military history</strong>.  In its narrow sense, the social perspective of military history seeks to understand the army (or navy or other service branch) as an extension of the society that created it.  We have, you may note,<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/"> done a bit of that here</a>.  Rather than understanding the army as a pure instrument of a general’s ‘genius’ it imagines it as a <em><strong>socially embedded</strong></em> institution – which is …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I have come to talk with you again, this time for my <code>fastpages</code> blog.</p>

<p><code>fastpages</code> gets a lot of things right for someone who uses <code>Jupyter</code> notebooks and wants to get into blogging. Prashanth Rao’s <a href="https://prrao87.github.io/blog/blogging-for-data-scientists/">article</a> does a great job of making the case for that.</p>



<p>However, being a long time user of the <a href="https://darkreader.org/">Dark Reader</a> browser extension, it was unusual to not have widespread dark mode support on many Jekyll themes, one of which <code>fastpages</code> is built on. Therefore, I decided to bring back the dark mode experience in this post.</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/dark-side.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I personally prefer dark mode to light as it causes lesser strain on the eyes. It also helps illuminate content while the background fades away. For someone who spends a good part of the day stuck behind a screen, I’ve made it a point to keep the bright light intake for outdoors.</p>

<p>Since I have not dabbled in designing dark mode experiences before, I plan to keep this process simple and understandable. We shall be using a bunch of simple css rules while following Material Design dark theme <a href="https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html">guidelines</a> (mostly).</p>

<p>Here’s the sample fastpages sample blog <a href="https://fastpages.fast.ai/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html">post</a> without Dark mode:</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/light-mode.png" alt="" title="Curb your light mode"></p>

<p>And here’s the <a href="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html">same one</a> with dark mode enabled!</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/dark-mode.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Pretty cool, yeah? Let’s check out the code now.</p>

<p>If you’re in a hurry to join the dark side, feel free to scroll to the end of this post and download the dark mode stylesheet.</p>

<p>If your curious about the design choices I’ve made and would like to customize for yourself, stick with me here.</p>



<p>Let’s start with defining our palette.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$high-emph</span><span>:</span> <span>rgba</span><span>(</span><span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>.87</span><span>);</span> <span>// Colour 1 -&gt; White</span>
<span>$med-emph</span><span>:</span> <span>rgba</span><span>(</span><span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>.69</span><span>);</span> <span>//Noice</span>
<span>$low-emph</span><span>:</span> <span>rgba</span><span>(</span><span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>.38</span><span>);</span>
<span>$dark-grey</span> <span>:</span> <span>#121212</span><span>;</span> <span>// Colour 2</span>
<span>$overlay</span><span>:</span> <span>mix</span><span>(</span><span>$dark-grey</span><span>,</span> <span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>95%</span><span>);</span>
<span>$overlay-light</span><span>:</span> <span>mix</span><span>(</span><span>$dark-grey</span><span>,</span> <span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>86%</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it. Two colours and their shades.</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/palette.svg" alt="" title="From left, dark grey and its shades and then the whites"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Baseline <code>dark-grey</code> theme colour which is recommended by Material design and <em>lighter</em> variants of it for components such as code blocks and tables.</li>
  <li>Shades of <code>white</code> for different levels of emphasis of text. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>This also gives us the flexibility to choose <em>our own</em> primary dark color. For eg, if we change the value of <code>dark-grey</code> to that of something like <code>deep-purple</code> (<code>#1F1B24</code>). Voilà, we get the following palette:</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/palette-2.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>and theme:</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/purple-mode.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The palette can be easily customized to support your own favorite dark colour!</p>



<p>The rest of the stylesheet is more or less straightforward. Here are some additional quirks that I thought were cool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t forget to turn over your faithful scrollbar to the dark side</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>*</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>scrollbar-color</span><span>:</span> <span>$dark-grey</span> <span>$overlay-light</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/scrollbars.png" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>You can invert the colour of your charts and plots to keep that dark consistency going.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>canvas</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>filter</span><span>:</span> <span>invert</span><span>(</span><span>100%</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/light-dark-viz.png" alt="" title="I like my graphs like I like my chocolate, dark"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Psst, Check out the dark graphs in action <a href="http://prudhvirampey.com/new_blog/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html#Example-1:-DropDown">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>We also got some dark tables in the house babyy 👾</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>table</span> <span>th</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>$overlay</span><span>;</span>
    <span>border-color</span><span>:</span> <span>$overlay-light</span><span>;</span>
    <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>$high-emph</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>table</span> <span>td</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>$dark-grey</span><span>;</span>
    <span>border-color</span><span>:</span> <span>$overlay-light</span><span>;</span>
    <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>$med-emph</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/light-dark-tables.png" alt="" title="Let there be shiny data"></p>



<p>You can get the stylesheet from this Github gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/prampey/aac8f8436827ea09f53a67873142706c">here</a>. Save it to <code>_sass/minima</code> and add this import line in <code>custom-styles.scss</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/*-----------------------------------*/</span>
<span>/*----- ADD YOUR STYLES BELOW -------*/</span>

<span>@import</span> <span>"minima/dark-mode"</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it! <code>fastpages</code> finally has the power of the dark side.</p>

		<p><em>First published 26 January 2019. Last updated 26 January 2019.</em></p>
<p>I don’t know if I’m allowed to do this, but I’m just posting the full text of this article by Arthur Koestler, because it’s not easy to find without an NYT subscription.</p>
<p>NYT published this as “The Nightmare That Is a Reality” on 9 January 1944.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>There is a dream which keeps coming back to me at almost regular intervals; it is dark, and I am being murdered in some kind of thicket or brushwood; there is a busy road at no more than ten yards distance; I scream for help but nobody hears me, the crowd walks past laughing and chatting. I know that a great many people share, with individual variations, the same type of dream. I have quarrelled about it with analysts and I believe it to be an archetype in the jungian sense: an expression of the individual’s ultimate loneliness when faced with death and cosmic violence; and his inability to communicate the unique horror of his experience.</p>
<p>I further believe that it is the root of the ineffectiveness of our atrocity propaganda. For, after all, you are the crowd who walk past laughing on the road; and there are a few of us, escaped victims or eyewitnesses of the things which happen in the thicket and who, haunted by our memories, go on screaming on the wireless, yelling at you in newspapers and in public meetings, theatres and cinemas. Now and then we succeed in reaching your ear for a minute. I know it each time it happens by a certain dumb wonder on your faces, a faint glassy stare entering your eye; and I tell myself: now you have got them, now hold them, bold them, so that they will remain awake. But it only lasts a minute. You shake yourself like puppies who have got their fur wet; then the transparent screen descends again and you walk on, protected by the dream barrier which stifles all sound.</p>
<p>We, the screamers, have been at it now for about ten years. We started on the night when the epileptic van der Lubbe set fire to the German Parliament; we said that if you don’t quench those flames at once, they will spread all over the world; you thought we were maniacs. At present we have the mania of trying to tell you about the killing, by hot steam, mass-electrocution and live burial of the total Jewish population of Europe. So far three million have died. It is the greatest mass-killing in recorded history; and it goes on daily, hourly, as regularly as the ticking of your watch. I have photographs before me on the desk while I am writing this, and that accounts for my emotion and bitterness. People died to smuggle them out of Poland; they thought it was worth while. The facts have been published in pamphlets, White Books, newspapers, magazines and what not.</p>
<p>But the other day I met one of the best-known American journalists over here. He told me that in the course of some recent public opinion survey nine out of ten average American citizens, when asked whether they believed that the Nazis commit atrocities, answered that it was all propaganda lies, and that they didn’t believe a word of it. As to this country, I have been lecturing now for three years to the troops and their attitude is the same. They don’t believe in concentration camps, they don’t believe in the starved children of Greece, in the shot hostages of France, in the mass-graves of Poland; they have never heard of Lidice, Treblinka or Belzec; you can convince them for an hour, then they shake themselves, their mental self-defence begins to work and in a week the shrug of incredulity has returned like a reflex temporarily weakened by a shock.</p>
<p>Clearly all this is becoming a mania with me and my like. Clearly we must suffer from some morbid obsession, whereas the others are healthy and normal. But the characteristic symptom of maniacs is that they lose contact with reality and live in a phantasy world. So, perhaps, it is the other way round: perhaps it is we, the screamers, who react in a sound and healthy way to the reality which surrounds us, whereas you are the neurotics who totter about in a screened phantasy world because you lack the faculty to face the facts. Were it not so, this war would have been avoided, and those murdered within sight of your day-dreaming eyes would still be alive. I said: perhaps, because obviously the above can only be half the truth.</p>
<p>There have been screamers at all times-Prophets, Preachers, Teachers and Cranks, cursing the obtuseness of their contemporaries, and the situation-pattern remained very much the same. There are always the screamers screaming from the thicket and the people who pass by on the road. They have ears but hear not, they have eyes but see not. So the roots of this must lie deeper than mere obtuseness. Is it perhaps the fault of the screamers? Sometimes no doubt, but I do not believe this to be the core of the matter. Amos, Hosea, Jeremiah were pretty good propagandists and yet they failed to shake their people and to warn them. Cassandra’s voice was said to have pierced walls, and yet the Trojan war took place.</p>
<p>And at our end of the chain–in due proportion–I believe that on the whole the M.O.I. and B.B.C. are quite competent at their job. For almost three years they had to keep this country going on nothing but defeats, and they succeeded. But at the same time they lamentably failed to imbue the people with anything approaching a full awareness of what it was all about, of the grandeur and horror of the time into which they were born. They carried on business-as-usual style, with the only difference that the routine of this business included killing and being killed. Matter-of-fact unimaginativeness has become a kind of Anglo-Saxon racial myth; it is usually opposed to Latin hysterics and praised for its high value in an emergency. But the myth does not say what happens between emergencies and that the same quality is responsible for the failure to prevent their recurrence. Now this limitation of awareness is not an Anglo-Saxon privilege, though they are probably the only race which claims as an asset what others regard as a deficiency. Nor is it a matter of temperament; stoics have wider horizons than fanatics.</p>
<p>It is a psychological fact, inherent in our mental frame, which I believe has not been given sufficient attention in social psychology or political theory. We say, “I believe this,” or, “I don’t believe that,” “I know it,” or “I don’t know. it”; and regard these as black-and-white altematives. Now in reality both “knowing” and “believing” have varying degrees of intensity. I know that there was a man called Spartacus who led the Roman slaves into revolt; but my belief in his one-time existence is much paler than that of, say Lenin. I believe in spiral nebulae, can see them in a telescope and express their distance in figures; but they have a lower degree of reality for me than the inkpot on my table. Distance in space and time degrades intensity of awareness.</p>
<p>So does magnitude. Seventeen is a figure which I know intimately like a friend; fifty billions is just a sound. A dog run over by a car upsets our emotional balance and digestion; three million Jews killed in Poland cause but a moderate uneasiness. Statistics don’t bleed; it is the detail which counts. We are unable to embrace the total process with our awareness; we can only focus on little lumps of reality. So far all this is a matter of degrees; of gradations in the intensity of knowing and believing. But when we pass the realm of the finite and are faced with words like eternity in time, infinity of space, that is, when we approach the sphere of the Absolute, our reaction ceases to be a matter of degrees and becomes different in quality.</p>
<p>Faced with the Absolute, understanding breaks down, and our “knowing” and “believing” become pure lip-service. Death, for instance, belongs to the category of the Absolute and our belief in it is merely a lip-service belief. “I know” that, the average statistical age being about 65, I may reasonably expect to live no more than another 27 years, but if I knew for certain that I should die on November 30, 1970, at 5 A.M., I would be poisoned by this knowledge, count and recount the remaining days and hours, grudge myself every wasted minute, in other words develop a neurosis. This has nothing to do with hopes to live longer than the average; if the date were fixed ten years later, the neurosis-forming process would remain the same.</p>
<p>Thus we all live in a state of split consciousness. There is a tragic plane and a trivial plane, which contain. two mutually incompatible kinds of experienced knowledge. Their climate and language are as different as Church Latin from business slang. These limitations of awareness account for the limitations of enlightenment by propaganda. People go to cinemas, they see films of Nazi tortures, of mass-shootings, of underground conspiracy and self-sacrifice. They sigh, they shake their heads, some have a good cry. But they do not connect it with the realities of their normal plane of existence. It is Romance, it is Art, it is Those Higher Things, it is Church Latin. It does not click with reality. We live in a society of the Jekyll and Hyde pattern, magnified into gigantic proportions.</p>
<p>This was, however, not always the case to the same extent. There were periods and movements in history-in Athens, in the early Renaissance, during the first years of the Russian Revolution-when at least certain representative layers of society had attained a relatively high level of mental integration; times, when people seemed to rub their eyes and come awake, when their cosmic awareness seemed to expand, when they were “contemporaries” in a much broader and fuller sense; when the trivial and the cosmic planes seemed on the point of fusing. And there were periods of disintegration and dissociation. But never before, not even during the spectacular decay of Rome and Byzantium, was split thinking so palpably evident, such a uniform mass-disease; never did human psychology reach …</p></div></div>

            <p><img src="http://www.upv.es/noticias-upv/imagenes/int_itq.jpg" alt="" title=""></p><p>A team of researchers from the Universitat Politècnica de València  (UPV) and the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) has discovered a new method that makes it possible to transform electricity into hydrogen or chemical products by solely using microwaves – without cables and without any type of contact with electrodes. This can represent a disruption in the field of energy research and a key development for the decarbonisation of process industry, as well as for the future of the automotive sector and the chemical industry, among many others. The study has been published in the latest edition of Nature Energy.</p> 
<p>The technology developed and patented by the UPV and CSIC is based on the phenomenon of the microwave reduction of solid materials, in this study exemplified by the reduction of Cerium oxide. This method enables to carry out electrochemical processes directly without requiring electrodes, which simplifies and significantly reduce capital costs, as it provides more freedom in the design of the structure of the device and choosing the operation conditions, mainly the electrolysis temperature.</p> 
<p>“It is a technology with great practical potential, especially for its use in energy storage and production of synthetic fuels and green chemicals. This aspect has significant importance nowadays, as both transportation and industry are immersed in a transition towards decarbonisation and electrification, meaning they have to meet very challenging targets in 2030 and 2040 in order to decrease the consumption of energy and substances from fossil sources, mainly natural gas and oil,” highlights Prof. José Manuel Serra, researcher from the Chemical Technology Institute (ITQ).</p> 
<h3>Green hydrogen for industrial and transportation uses</h3> 
<p>The main use of this “disruptive” technology reported by researchers from the Information Technologies and Communications Institute (ITACA) of the UPV and ITQ, joint centre of the UPV and CSIC, is the production of green hydrogen (produced without emitting greenhouse gases) from water, for industrial and transportation uses.</p> 
<p>As noted by the ITQ and ITACA team, it is a technology with great potential for the automotive sector, specifically for cars fuelled by fuel cells and hybrids or large vehicles such as trains or ships. But also for the chemical industry, metallurgy, the ceramic sector or the production of fertilisers, among many other sectors. “This method will make it possible to transform renewable electricity, typically of solar or wind origin, into added value products and green fuels. It has countless uses and we hope that new uses will emerge for energy storage and process industry, by tuning materials composition and operation conditions”, highlights Prof. José Manuel Catalá, researcher at the ITACA institute of the UPV.</p> 
<p>In the article published in Nature Energy, the researchers also provide a techno-economic study that reveals that this technology would enable to obtain high energetic efficiency, and that the cost of the facilities (CAPEX) to carry out the hydrogen production process are very competitive compared to conventional technologies for hydrogen production.</p> 
<h3>Ultra-fast charging of batteries… and space exploration</h3> 
<p>The UPV and CSIC team is studying other future uses for this technology, and is currently focusing its efforts on the use for the ultra-fast charging of batteries “Our technology could enable a practically instantaneous reduction (electron injection) of the electrode (metallic anode) that stores energy. In other words, we would go from a (2D) layer-based progressive charging process, which can take hours, to a simultaneous recharging process in the entire (3D) volume of the material storing the energy, which would make it possible to charge a battery in a few seconds,” says Prof. Catalá.</p> 
<p>Another use would be the direct generation of oxygen with microwaves, which opens a broad spectrum of new uses. “One specific use would be the direct production of oxygen with extra-terrestrial rocks (regoliths), which could have a key role in the future exploration and colonisation of the Moon, Mars or other moons in the solar system,” concludes Prof. Serra.</p> 
<h3>A short history of the discovery</h3> 
<p>The team of researchers observed that when ionic materials were treated with microwaves, the materials displayed unusual changes in their properties, especially in their electronic conductivity, changes that did not happen upon conventional heating. “We were very intrigued about these sudden changes in their electrical properties and wanted to understand what process was going on. For this reason, we keep on designing new experiments, new microwave reactors and utilizing other analytical techniques,” explains Prof. Catalá.</p> 
<p>The team from the ITACA and ITQ institutes verified that microwaves interact with these materials by ‘accelerating’ the electrons and triggering the release of molecules of oxygen from their structure (which is also called reduction). This change became visible to us by sudden alterations to the conductivity at relatively low temperatures (approximately 300ºC). “This non-equilibrium state is maintained while microwaves are applied, but tends to revert back via reoxygenation (reoxidation) when microwaves are switched off. At first sight, we realised the great practical potential of this discovery, especially now that very ambitious goals should be meet in the next two decades to reach an economy with zero net greenhouse gas emissions,” concludes Prof. Serra.</p>

  <p>Being able to feel empathy and to take in the other person's perspective – these are two abilities through which we understand what is going on in the other person's mind. Although both terms are in constant circulation, it is still unclear what exactly they describe and constitute. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) in Leipzig, together with colleagues from Oxford University and other institutions, have now developed a model which explains what empathy and perspective taking are made of. They show that it is not one specific skill that enables us to put ourselves in another person's shoes.

<p>Understanding what other people want, how they feel, and how they see the world is becoming increasingly important in our complex, globalised society. Social skills enable us to make friends and create a network of people who support us. But not everyone finds it easy to interact with other people. One of the main reasons is that two of the most important social skills - empathy, i.e. being able to empathise with the other person's emotions, and the ability to take a perspective, i.e. being able to gain an information by adopting another person’s point of view - are developed to different degrees.</p>
<p>Researchers have long been trying to find out what helps one to understand others. The more you know about these two social skills, the better you can help people to form social relationships. However, it still not exactly clear what empathy and perspective taking are (the latter is also known as “theory of mind“). Being able to read a person's emotions through their eyes, understand a funny story, or interpret the action of another person—in everyday life there are always social situations that require these two important abilities. However, they each require a combination of different individual subordinate skills. If it is necessary to interpret looks and facial expressions in one situation, in another it may be necessary to think along with the cultural background of the narrator or to know his or her current needs.</p>

<p>To date, countless studies have been conducted that examine empathy and perspective taking as a whole. However, it has not yet been clarified what constitutes the core of both competencies and where in the brain their bases lie. Philipp Kanske, former MPI CBS research group leader and currently professor at the TU Dresden, together with Matthias Schurz from the Donders Institute in Nijmegen, Netherlands, and an international team of researchers, have now developed a comprehensive explanatory model.</p>
<p>"Both of these abilities are processed in the brain by a 'main network' specialised in empathy or changing perspective, which is activated in every social situation. But, depending on the situation, it also involves additional networks," Kanske explains, referring to the results of the study, which has just been published in the journal&nbsp;<i>Psychological Bulletin</i>. If we read the thoughts and feelings of others, for example, from their eyes, other additional regions are involved than if we deduce them from their actions or from a narrative. "The brain is thus able to react very flexibly to individual requirements."</p>
<p>For empathy, a main network that can recognise acutely significant situations, for example, by processing fear, works together with additional specialised regions, for example, for face or speech recognition. When changing perspective, in turn, the regions that are also used for remembering the past or fantasising about the future, i.e., for thoughts that deal with things that cannot be observed at the moment, are active as the core network. Here too, additional brain regions are switched on in each concrete situation.</p>
<p><strong>Complex social problems require a combination of empathy and perspective taking</strong></p>
<p>Through their analyses, the researchers have also found out that particularly complex social problems require a combination of empathy and a change of perspective. People who are particularly competent socially seem to view the other person in both ways­—­on the basis of feelings and on the basis of thoughts. In their judgement, they then find the right balance between the two.</p>
<p>"Our analysis also shows, however, that a lack of one of the two social skills can also mean that not this skill as a whole is limited. It may be that only a certain factor is affected, such as understanding facial expressions or speech melody," adds Kanske. A single test is therefore not sufficient to certify a person's lack of social skills. Rather, there must be a series of tests to actually assess them as having little empathy, or as being unable to take the other person's point of view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scientists have investigated these relationships by means of a large-scale meta-analysis. They identified, on the one hand, commonalities in the MRI pattern of the 188 individual studies examined when the participants used empathy or perspective taking. This allowed the localisation of the core regions in the brain for each of the two social skills. However, results also indicated how the MRI patterns differed depending on the specific task and, therefore, which additional brain regions were used.&nbsp;</p>

This post is an attempt to provide a visual comparison of pretty dramatic UI changes between macOS Catalina and Big Sur.</p>
<p>Why did I end up doing this? Well, this week I installed the developer beta of macOS Big Sur as I was curious what impact the new UI would have on the <a href="https://www.andrewdenty.com/airtame-desktop-app.html">app I currently design</a>. I wanted to make sure my team was ahead of any coming changes as we were burned by changes in last year’s release of Catalina.</p>
<p>I found myself taking lots of screenshots to try and track the changes and thought this might be worth sharing. I decided to carry out a quick catalogue of the UI changes as this may be helpful to other people getting ready for macOS Big Sur.</p>
<p>All of the screenshots below are taken on a default install of macOS and the Catalina version is always on the left. I made a conscious effort not to resize any windows or change any default settings. I haven’t captured everything, but it is a good taste of the changes so far.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>


<p>At first glance macOS is a lot more colourful with, and the biggest obvious change is the bright, slightly more cartoonish iOS shaped icons. Everything is more rounded and it feels like everything has gotten a little bigger. Could this be the first hint that macOS is preparing for touch support in the future? One interesting tidbit, is that even though the icons are based around the capsule shape, many of them (like Contacts, or Preview) have elements which protrude from them giving an extra feeling of depth.</p>
<h2 id="finder-and-preview">Finder and Preview</h2>
<p>Finder sees some significant changes. Of all the places I think Apple needs to get the new UI spot on, is Finder. Overall the default size of Finder seems to be bigger in macOS Big Sur.</p>


<p>One thing that struck me at this point is that Finder looks a mess with many of the more advanced features enabled. The bottom screenshot shows Finder with a Path Bar, Status Bar and multiple tabs. To me, it seems like the design team have not yet been able to find a way to elegantly integrate these elements into the iOS inspired UI.</p>
<p>One final thing to note is that in Finder the search bar at the top right has been replaced with a search icon that expands when clicked. This change seems a little inconsistent as it’s not made it to Preview. I can guarantee this will result in fewer people discovering Finder’s Spotlight search goodness.</p>
<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>
<p>Preferences sees quite a lot of change in some areas.
The Dock preferences pane has become “Dock and Menu Bar” and now integrates controls for the new macOS control center. It uses a nicely integrated sidebar to manage different categories.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that this sidebar hasn’t yet made it to other parts of the preferences UI with Network and Notifications still using a very old looking sidebar.</p>
<p>One aspect of preferences that has been quite controversial (on Twitter at least) is the new icons. I’m going to hold off judgement for now as they don’t yet look finished. For example, the Notifications icon does not even support retina displays.</p>


<p>You’ll notice that the Startup Disk pane uses apples new dialog (or sheet) UI. This is quite a departure from the existing sheet drop-down - it feels much more iOS-like.</p>
<h2 id="menu-bar-and-notification-center">Menu Bar and Notification Center</h2>
<p>This is one of the areas where macOS has changed the most. It’s also difficult to take decent screenshots of both of these. Control Center looks like it’s been badly photocopied and the Notification Center in Catalina has a bug whereby it renders at double it’s normal width.</p>
<p>What was obvious within a few minutes of use was that the Control Center is a massive improvement on Catalina’s row of scattered Menu bar icons. The updated WiFi menu is also a massive improvement, as the old list could easily be overwhelming with the number of WiFi networks displayed.</p>
<p>I’m less convinced that the Notification Center is easier to use though. Now it has no background, there is less to separate a list of notifications from my messy desktop!</p>
<p>I will try and get better screenshots for this section and update it in the near future.</p>


<h2 id="safari">Safari</h2>





<h2 id="reminders">Reminders</h2>


<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>The biggest news in Notes is that after years, the Skeuomorphic paper texture has finally been retired!</p>


<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2>


<h2 id="apple-music-and-podcasts">Apple Music and Podcasts</h2>
<p>Music and Podcasts were brand new last year with the release of Catalina. It’s obvious that the new UI has been planned for a while as Apple Music and Podcasts are mostly indistinguishable from their initial Catalina release. For example both apps already include the new full height sidebar.</p>
<p>For me this illustrates a bigger point that <a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1275311056672325633" target="_blank">Steven Sinofsky recently made on Twitter</a> - that Apple is executing a meticulous multi-year strategy.</p>


<p>One area where changes are evident are is in preferences windows. Both apps make use of Apple’s new accent colour and new glyph icon library.</p>
<h2 id="other-bundled-apps">Other bundled apps</h2>
<p>It was impossible to go into depth with every single bundled app. On the whole, the updates to Maps, Books and Mail all look solid with extensive use of the new sidebar.</p>


<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
<p>Both Activity Monitor and Disk Utility have received a new style toolbar. As with Finder, there are no longer any rows meaning all elements are at the same level. On first impressions, I feel this is a little visually confusing and makes it harder to scan. The search field also loses a lot of its contrast.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly Terminal is almost unchanged.</p>


<h2 id="almost-unchanged">Almost unchanged</h2>
<p>On the subject of unchanged apps, there were a number of other apps that are so far relatively unchanged.</p>
<p>Siri in macOS Big Sur shows no apparent changes. I think this is a little strange considering the overhaul Siri is receiving in iOS 14. There don’t even seem to be any radius changes to the borders.</p>
<p>The most extreme case of no change is Stickies. It’s completely identical between both releases. What’s more, I don’t think it’s changed much since MacOS 9 judging from its weird, retro controls.</p>


<p>Boot Camp is also practically unchanged, although this is perhaps unsurprising given Apple’s move to Apple Silicon, so presumably Boot Camp’s days are numbered. It did receive a new icon though.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Overall, the UI changes in macOS aren’t as dramatic as I was expecting. Big Sur’s new UI feels like a largely incremental set of changes to make macOS feel more coherent with iOS and iPad OS. Even if there are a few teething issues and the look is a little jarring at first, this has to be a good thing in the long-term.</p>
<p>Having said that, Apple still has a vast amount of work to do to perfect the new macOS UI. It unsurprising as this is the first developer beta, but there are still many rough edges.</p>
<p>I hope in the long term they focus on creating consistent patterns: for example for the first launch experience of apps. Right now there are several different layouts and approaches to this UI. I also hope Apple don’t leave pro users behind. Right now some of the less frequently used UI elements such as status bars and path bars look a little unloved. They don’t feel well integrated into the UI and in some cases lack visual separation.</p>

        <h2>Cold Email for Interesting People</h2>
        <p>Whether you want a new job, to meet your heroes, a feature on someone's show, or a unique opportunity that the public doesn't know about, the best way to get it is simple: just ask for what you want. I built an international career from the middle of Iowa, thousands miles away from the action. If you're like me and don't have tons of connections, you'll need to cold-contact people who you've never met to get things started. This course equips you with specific tactics for writing successful cold emails and encourages you to take your shot.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Video Introduction</h5>
        <p>In a short video, I discuss fundamental concepts relating to cold email including social proof, overcoming
            objections, and formulating a specific ask. <i>16 Minutes</i>.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Handbook</h5>
        <p>The handbook walks step-by-step through the process of deciding to write a cold email, figuring out who to email, finding their contact information, writing a compelling first message, and closing the conversation. <i>31 Pages</i>.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Six Annotated Examples</h5>
        <p>Go behind the scenes of my cold email success. I've annotated six examples from the past two years to share with you. Each example includes one or two emails, the context, and the
        payoff. For each email, I go through line-by-line and discuss the impact of the words and phrases. <i>48 Pages</i>.</p>

<!--FAQ SECTION-->
<div>
    <div>
        
        <h5>What is a cold email?</h5>
        <p>A cold email is sending an email to someone who you do not know, or do not know well. The "cold" in cold email doesn't
        refer to the tone (which should generally be warm, friendly, and professional), but rather to the lack of previous
        relationship.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Am I an interesting person?</h5>
        <p>I think so! Whether or not someone is interesting is quite situational. For example, Tom Brady wouldn't be interested in
        hearing from me with ideas for plays to run, but a developer advocate might be interested in hearing from me with ideas
        for technical content. Being interesting isn't so much an attribute but an action, so anyone can be interesting to the right person in the right situation!</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Who is this course not for?</h5>
        <p>This isn't a course about copywriting for mass emails or other bulk outreach. It isn't about generating leads or making
        tons of LinkedIn connections with some boilerplate message. It is about thinking deeply about how to connect with
        individuals about mutually interesting things.</p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5>How much should I pay?</h5>
        <p><i>Cold Email for Interesting People</i> is a pay-what-you-want product. You can pay any amount, even zero dollars, but I'd appreciate it if you paid for the product for both of our benefits. Paying for the product helps me run my business and makes you more invested in the content. You can also download for free, see if you like it, and then buy it again if you found it valuable.</p>
        <p>I did pay-what-you-want without a minimum to achieve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination#First_degree">perfect price discrimination</a> and avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">price anchoring</a>. But, if you really want guidance, let's say that if twenty bucks isn't a big deal for you, you should pay about that much, but if twenty bucks is a big deal for you, you should pay five or grab it for free and not feel bad either way. If you know me personally, you get it for free.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Is there a refund policy?</h5>
        <p>I have a 30-day no-questions-asked refund policy. If you don't like your purchase, let me know and I will refund your
            money. Because the product is pay-what-you-want, if you think you'd ask for a refund, I'd rather you just download for free because that saves us both time.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>What if I have another question?</h5>
        <p>Send me an email at <a href="mailto:philip@kiely.xyz">philip@kiely.xyz</a>.</p>

<p>American Bank Systems (ABS), a company that provides services to U.S. financial institutions and banks helping them “operate efficiently and confidently in a rapidly evolving – highly regulated – environment” has been hit by a ransomware attack this month.</p>



<p><strong><em>Avaddon</em>,</strong> the ransomware group behind the attack had earlier alleged they had acquired over 50 GB of the company’s proprietary data but had leaked a partial 4 GB dump earlier this month, part of which has been analyzed by <em>Security Report News.</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="554" height="401" src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3.png 554w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3-300x217.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" data-srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3.png 554w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3-300x217.png 300w" data-src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Screenshot of files present in leaked data dump (source: Avaddon)</figcaption></figure>



<p>It appears, this week, the threat actors have published the full 52.57 GB dump after ABS had likely refused to cooperate with <em>Avaddon’s</em> ransom demands.</p>



<p>The incident seems to have occurred sometime in or before early October, given the timestamps on the screenshots of leaked files.</p>



<p>The cyberattack is concerning as ABS’ clients included multiple banking names and mortgage companies, such as <em>First Federal Community Bank</em>,<em> Rio Bank</em>, <em>Citizens Bank of Swainsboro,</em> <em>First Bank &amp; Trust</em>, etc.</p>



<p>Although ABS’ clients—banks and mortgage providers, may not have been directly hit by this cyberattack, ABS does provide banking software and systems to facilitate bank processes and compliance requirements to these banks. </p>



<p>By breaching ABS, threat actors may have therefore gained access to their clients’ data, and further the banking customers’ data.</p>



<h2>Data contains loan documents, emails, contracts, network shares, passwords</h2>



<p>The leaked data in the dump includes files such as loan documents, business contracts, private emails, invoices, credentials for network shares, and other confidential information.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="675" src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min-1024x675.png" alt="" srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min-1024x675.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min-300x198.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min-768x506.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min-1536x1012.png 1536w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min.png 1730w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min-1024x675.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min-300x198.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min-768x506.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min-1536x1012.png 1536w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min.png 1730w" data-src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sr1-min-1024x675.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Leaked credentials to network drive associated with <em>The Bank of New Madrid</em> </figcaption></figure>



<p>Another document, a spreadsheet shown below appears to be financial records of a bank that had used ABS’ services. This is likely how the attackers got access to the bank’s files.</p>



<p>In the financial document, along with personal information and loan amounts, the banking customers’ Tax ID numbers (likely Social Security Numbers) are also exposed.</p>

<p>Other proprietary information leaked includes what appears to be employee and customer data.</p>



<h2>Not clear how many customers impacted</h2>



<p>Ransomware attacks can hit any business despite having state-of-the-art security controls in place as <em>human element</em> remains the weakest link.</p>



<p>However, this incident is particularly chilling.</p>



<p>By breaching just one company <em>American Bank Systems (ABS) </em>that touts itself as providing compliance and risk management services to multiple banks, the threat actors gained access to not only ABS’ client systems (i.e. banks and financial institutions) but also got their hands on data of individuals who are customers of these banks.</p>



<p>It is not clear how many individual banking customers and financial organizations are impacted as a result of this breach. </p>



<p><em>Security Report</em> had been monitoring the ransomware operators’ claims for weeks but waited to publish our findings after they were made public on Twitter:  </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It is also not known what steps has ABS taken to protect their systems moving forward, and those of the partner banks after this incident.</p>



<p>And more importantly, who is addressing the individual banking customers whose personal information has been compromised as a part of this cyberattack?</p>



<p><em>Security Report</em> reached out to multiple ABS contacts via email for comment but we have not heard back yet.</p>

      Papers are like poems. Some are dazzling, some are pedestrian, some are insightful, and some reward long periods of quiet contemplation. They stir up an emotional reaction that goes beyond the strictly rational, and can often be deeply personal.</p>

    <p>
      In graduate school, during a period of identity crisis, I came across <a href="https://felleisen.org/matthias/">Matthias Felleisen's</a> “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016764239190036W">On the Expressive Power of Programming Languages</a>”. At a time when the world was ruled by C++, I had immersed myself in Scheme, so I always looked skeptically at mainstream linguistic claims. However, the language wars seemed beyond rational discourse. So the idea that someone could take a concept as nebulous as “expressiveness&amp;rdquo and formalize it was already a revelation. But the beauty of this paper goes well beyond that: it also lies in the cleanliness of the approach, the correspondence of the formalism to intuition, and the tautness of its execution.</p>

    <p>
      It was the most stunning paper I had ever read, and remains so. It's like the poem that never leaves your soul.</p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, this paper may not be easy to read for the uninitiated: it depends on a certain amount of “cultural knowledge” of programming language theory. I hope to peel off some of those layers and help you, too, understand the paper — hopefully while preserving the joy and beauty I experienced.</p>

      Shriram is the Vice President for Programming Languages at Brown University in Providence, RI, USA. He’s not, really, but that’s what it says on his business card. At heart, he's a person of ill-repute: a <a href="https://schemers.org/">Schemer</a>, <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racketeer</a>, and <a href="https://www.pyret.org/">Pyreteer</a>. He believes tropical fruit are superior to all other kinds. He is terrified of success, because he may be forced to buy a suit. He is known to interrogate his audiences to ensure they’re paying attention. <strong>So, be alert. You can read email later.</strong>

    <p>This post contains three updates at different points in time on formalizing
chapter 1 of Michael Spivak’s <em>Calculus</em> book and its problems in <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">Lean</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the proofs <a href="https://github.com/tomhoule/spivak-calculus/">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="just-starting">Just starting</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>On n’écrit qu’à la pointe de son savoir, à cette pointe extrême qui sépare
notre savoir et notre ignorance, et qui fait passer l’un dans l’autre. C’est
seulement de cette façon qu’on est déterminé à écrire.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_and_Repetition"><em>Différence et
répétition</em></a>, towards
the beginning)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They say the right time to write about something is while learning. I just got
through <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/"><em>Theorem proving in
Lean</em></a> — tons of fun,
warmly recommended — and now feels like the time to see what I can do with it.</p>
<p>I have Michael Spivak’s
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328645.Calculus"><em>Calculus</em></a>, third
edition, lying around at home. It should be accessible with a bit of help from
the internet, so this is what I will attempt to go through. I expect nearly all
of the book’s content to be new to me.</p>
<p>What I want to validate is that for someone reasonably familiar with programming
who wants to learn more mathematics, it is possible to learn by writing proofs
and solving problems from regular maths textbooks with existing tools, and in
particular the Lean theorem prover. <strong>The hard part should be the mathematics,
not handling the theorem prover</strong>.</p>
<p>I have the feeling this would be the best way for me to learn, since I lack the
confidence in my hand-written proofs, and I know by experience that I make a lot
of mistakes. On paper, these mistakes end up derailing the proof, but they
wouldn’t have serious consequences if every step was checked by a computer: I
can just correct them.</p>
<p>I will frequently refer to
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib">mathlib</a>, the Lean community’s
library of formalized theorems. It contains basic facts and structures you do
not want to build again when writing your own proofs, as well as extremely
useful tactics like <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#linarith"><code>linarith</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="first-chapter">First chapter</h3>
<p>The first chapter is titled <em>Basic properties of numbers</em>. Its purpose is to
reformulate and condense facts that the reader supposedly already knows.</p>
<p>Twelve properties are treated. Four properties of addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>Associativity: $$ a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c $$</li>
<li>Zero as the identity element: $$ a + 0 = 0 + a = a $$</li>
<li>Addition of opposites: $$ a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0 $$</li>
<li>Commutativity: $$ a + b = b + a $$</li>
</ol>
<p>By now, subtraction is already defined, and two small proofs already carried
out. I used the standard library’s <code>int</code> module for the time being, but
I suspect we’ll have to switch to mathlib’s real number module or something
else, after I read a bit more about it.</p>
<p>The next properties are about multiplication:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Associativity: $$ a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c $$</li>
<li>One as the identity element: $$ a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a $$</li>
<li>Multiplication of inverses:
$$ \forall a, a ≠ 0 \to \exists a^{-1}, a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = 1 $$</li>
<li>Commutativity: $$ a \cdot b = b \cdot a $$</li>
</ol>
<p>Division is then defined in terms of multiplication. The part of property 7
about <em>a</em>&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0 explains why division by zero doesn’t work (it has no meaningful
inverse).</p>
<p>At this point, I feel an itch to generalize this beyond integers. We’re going to
need at least real numbers, I figure. I start browsing Wikipedia:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">groups</a> aren’t what we want
(numbers under addition are a group, but not multiplication because it lacks
invertibility). Next stop is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication#Multiplication_of_different_kinds_of_numbers">multiplication</a>,
which points me to the page on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_the_real_numbers#Construction_from_Cauchy_sequences">construction of real
numbers</a>,
where I&nbsp;learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)">ordered
fields</a>. This is apparently
what we&nbsp;want, and mathlib <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html">apparently supports
them</a>.</p>
<p>I hope this attitude of digging just as deep as I need to in order to make
progress is going to work out.</p>
<p>After a little while digging into how to import mathlib (combination of using
the right lean version in <code>leanpkg.toml</code>, learning the existence of <code>import</code>
statements, and the right <code>leanpkg</code> invocations — <em>Note added later: use
<code>leanproject</code> instead if you want to avoid compiling mathlib, it is very
time-consuming</em>), I realize working with fields won’t let you use convenient
numeric notations. I try real numbers — appropriately located at
<code>data.real.basic</code> in mathlib — only to realize that reflexivity doesn’t work for
things as simple as <code>5 - 3 = 2</code>. Looking at the source for the <code>data.real.basic</code>
module, it seems like many definitions are non-computable. It makes sense,
because real numbers aren’t the floats we know and love, π isn’t some
approximation but really π, and we can’t compute that exactly. I don’t know whether Lean
can “specialize” computable instances automatically, and detect that even though
<code>5</code> and <code>3</code> are real numbers in this context, <code>5 - 3</code> is computable. I’d have to
know more about representations of reals to know if it’s a temporary limitation
in mathlib or something deeper. So I go with rational numbers for the examples
involving reflexivity. <code>α</code> is a field, rational numbers are a field, so it works
out nicely.</p>
<p>The consequences of the properties of multiplication give rise to two nice
examples we can prove in Lean:</p>
<pre><code>example : (a ≠ 0) → (a * b = a * c) → b = c :=
assume hnzero h,
    calc
        b   = 1 * b : by rw one_mul
        ... = (a⁻¹ * a) * b : by rw [inverse_mul α a hnzero]
        ... = a⁻¹ * (a * b) : by rw [mul_assoc']
        ... = a⁻¹ * (a * c) : by rw [h]
        ... = c : by rw [mul_assoc', inverse_mul α a hnzero, one_mul]

example : a ≠ 0 → (a * b = 0) → (a = 0 ∨ b = 0) :=
assume hnzero h,
or.inr $ calc
    b = 1 * b : by rw one_mul b
    ... = (a⁻¹ * a) * b : by rw [inverse_mul α a hnzero]
    ... = a⁻¹ * (a * b) : by rw [mul_assoc']
    ... = a⁻¹ * 0 : by rw h
    ... = 0 : by rw mul_zero
</code></pre>
<p>I started by adding <code>decidable α</code> instance on top of <code>field α</code> to get
<code>a&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&nbsp;∨&nbsp;¬(a&nbsp;=&nbsp;0)</code> for the second example. It felt like it should be possible to
prove it without, but it seemed like even mathlib uses <code>classical</code> (see
<code>mul_eq_zero'</code> in <code>group_with_zero.lean</code>, and <code>division_ring.to_domain</code> in
<code>field.lean</code>). Then I noticed the book relies on <code>a ≠ 0</code> and added the hypothesis.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Distributivity: $$ a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) $$</li>
</ol>
<p>For the next proof, I needed a proof of <code>0&nbsp;≠&nbsp;2</code>, which I got to from <code>0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;2</code>,
which required changing the instance of <code>field&nbsp;α</code> to <code>linear_ordered_field&nbsp;α</code>.
That seems reasonable.</p>
<p>Writing down the proof also made it clearer that the part that needs
distributivity is <code>a&nbsp;+&nbsp;a&nbsp;= 2&nbsp;*&nbsp;a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def add_self_eq_two_mul : a + a = 2 * a :=
calc
    a + a   = (a * 1) + a : by rw mul_one'
        ... = (a * 1) + (a * 1) : by rw mul_one'
        ... = a * (1 + 1) : by rw [←mul_distrib']
        ... = a * 2 : by refl
        ... = 2 * a : by rw mul_comm'
</code></pre>
<p><code>-a</code> can also be called an additive inverse. Interesting.</p>
<p>…<em>ellipsis</em>…</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="two-weeks-later">Two weeks later</h2>
<p>I continued going through the chapter step by step, and now getting started on
the problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some patterns like “divide both sides of the equation by the same amount” do
not translate easily to Lean. I had to learn to “summon” values, adding zero,
then opposite, or multiplying by one, then inverse.</li>
<li>Represent sequences with inductively defined functions (gizmo).</li>
<li>A lot of function names to memorize</li>
<li>I somehow find some facts easier to grasp through induction rules:
<ul>
<li><code>choose k n = choose k-1 n-1 + choose k n-1</code></li>
<li><code>n! = n * (n-1)!</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I had to figure out big operators and how to use finite sets (<code>finset</code>)</li>
<li>For problem 4, I had to figure out casts and
<code>rwa</code>, <code>simpa</code>. Do the computable parts with integers, then cast to reals to
work with square roots. Computations with real numbers were a pain at first,
since they are not computable: you need to cast to something computable, like
rational numbers, to make any progress. <em>Note added later: this was all solved when I learned
about the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#norm_num"><code>norm_num</code></a> and <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#norm_cast"><code>norm_cast</code></a> tactics</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#library_search">library_search</a>,
<a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#squeeze_simp%20/%20squeeze_simpa%20/%20squeeze_dsimp%20/%20squeeze_scope">squeeze_simp</a>
are big time-savers and enormously helpful in discovering more of mathlib. One
pattern that works really well when you are looking for the right theorems to
invoke for the next step in your proof, is to write it in the most general way
possible in an example or a helper function, and try <code>library_search</code> on that.</li>
<li>Try <code>#lint</code> — it’s quaint.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll stop here now, and focus on solving the problems without worrying about
whether this will make a good blog post.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-few-months-later">A few months later</h2>
<p>Let’s follow up on the experience report, where I wrote down my impressions as I
just started working on the problems from Michael Spivak’s
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328645.Calculus"><em>Calculus</em></a> (3rd ed.) with
the Lean theorem prover.</p>
<p>A few months later, <a href="https://github.com/tomhoule/spivak-calculus/">I finished writing Lean proofs for all the problems in chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p>After the expected period of familiarization with Lean and
mathlib, what I hoped for is what happened: <strong>at this point, for the problems I
am solving, the hard part is the maths, not the theorem prover</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="writing-down-the-problems">Writing down the problems</h3>
<p>Some problems took some thinking to translate from natural language into Lean.
Stating the problem precisely is part of the proof effort.</p>
<p>Take problem 24 (c):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <code>s(a_{1},...,a_{k})</code> be some sum formed from <code>a_{1},...,a_{k}</code>. Show that
$$s(a_{1},…,a_{k}) = a_{1} + … + a_{k}$$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “some sum” part is open to interpretation. It could mean different ordering
of the terms, or different precedence. I went with precedence, and wrote the
following proof</p>
<pre><code>-- For any list of lists of sums, show that the sum of the list_sum's is equal
-- to the list_sum of the concatenated lists. This shows the order of
-- additions does not matter.
def part_c : ∀ (sums : list (list ℝ)), list_sum (list.join sums) = sums.foldl running_list_sum 0
| [] := rfl
| (head::tail) := by {
    let consed := list.cons head tail,
    have ih : list_sum (list.join tail) = tail.foldl running_list_sum 0, from part_c tail,
    have left : list_sum …</code></pre></div></div>

            <h4>Using Matrix to replace proprietary and centralized chat apps</h4><p>
            Reading time: 3 minutes.
            </p><p>As you may know it, I am a fervent user of the chat protocol Matrix.
If you don’t know what Matrix is, this is basically a protocol developed by the Matrix Foundation. Matrix is made to be federated, it means that servers implementing correctly the Matrix specification can communicate and therefore, users that are not on the same servers can still talk to each other. Some examples of federation would be with Activitypub (Mastodon) or Usenet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But wait Jae, we already have countless other chat apps already, Telegram, Signal and even XMPP which is federated!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, here are the advantages of Matrix over all of those:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Matrix is 100% open-source. As you may know Telegram’s servers are currently closed-source which poses a problem about trust. Nobody can say what the server is doing nor what it is harvesting which could be very dangerous. On the other hand, Signal, XMPP and Matrix are all fully open-source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix isn’t centralized to a single server. Currently, Telegram and Signal are centralized apps which means if the server goes down, everyone else goes down. moxie0 of Signal even wrote a <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">blog post</a> on ‘why Signal will never have federation’ which is in my opinion a big mistake. XMPP still stands up as it is federated as well and has plenty of server implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix has a flagship client which has a great UX. <strong>This</strong> is a big point, as other federated protocols such as XMPP are kinda like a jungle for new users, you are greeted with a list of all clients which you can use and then comes the step where you have to choose your server. Lots of those servers are sometime hard to find, have very spartan UIs or even no web form or easy way to register whatsoever. On the other hand, Matrix has a flagship, <strong>Element</strong>, which is deemed as the ‘official Matrix client’ since it implements the Matrix specification correctly and is made by basically the same people. While other projects would have only done a server, Element made a polished client, focused mainly on the UX in order for people to take the first steps of moving to anything else easier. Even if the UX is still not perfect and some aspects aren’t finished yet, moving to Element will be easier than moving to any other XMPP client.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been using Matrix since 2016 now and it has considerably improved over time, coming from “barely usable” to “let’s host my own homeserver”.
Even in its current state, lots of things are to be improved such as communities or custom stickers but everything is on the right way.
From now on, everything can <strong>only improve</strong>, we are seeing new server implementations, new clients, bots, communities moving to Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix has several other features such as E2EE (end-to-end encryption) which is now enabled by default and bridges which can be used to temporarily bridge a Matrix room and a slack chat for instance.</p>
<p>If you want to give Matrix a try, download <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> and create an account, it doesn’t even requires an email address!
You can also come and say ‘hello’ in my very own channel <strong>#home:jae.moe</strong> !</p>
<p>That’s all for today,
I’ll see you next time!

    <p>Hi Wendy,</p>

<p>I hope you’re having a great day. I came across your profile on Tinder and wanted to introduce myself. My name is Steve McDichael and I’m a Technical Recruiting Partner for Serf.com.</p>

<p>At this time, we have a great opportunity* for a Software Engineering role with the Digital Overseer team in our Provider Operations department. The team is developing a revolutionary new technology to improve our efficiency in extracting work from Providers on our platform, thereby increasing satisfaction for our Customers. It’s a small team, and an elite one (kind of like the Navy Seals of Serf.com), which means we’re only considering applicants who are passionate about our mission, and who have a track record of building tools to help the extremely powerful maintain their illegitimate hold on power. A B.S. in Computer Science is also a plus.</p>

<p>The team is filled with rockstars who have experience at world-class companies like WitchHunt, SlaveX, Genocidr and Palantir Technologies. Furthermore, the team reports directly to the CEO, who has an MBA from the Bowser School of Business at Tyrant University.</p>

<p>We’re still just a few months out of seed stage, but we’ve already secured several billion in funding from King Henry VI, Joffrey Baratheon, Darth Vader, and the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. In the last six months, we’ve doubled our Customer count and have already saved them millions through AI-powered regulatory arbitrage as well as execution recommendations for Dissenting Providers. In the next six months, we are hoping to roll out our cutting-edge automated whipping prototype, which has been successful in trials and which will allow us to more quickly scale up to meet customer demand.</p>

<p>Our compensation packages are highly competitive, and we offer great benefits that go above and beyond other companies. We have fully-stocked microkitchens as well as daily breakfast, lunch and dinner, lovingly prepared and served by our in-house serfs; we have weekly <em>prima nocta</em> nights; we have frequent team bonding events including a live darts game featuring the most impertinent Providers. You can also bring your dog to the office.</p>

<p>I’m sure you’re busy, but if this sounds like an opportunity you’d be interested in, I would love to hop on the phone with you and give you a better sense of what we’re looking for. You can reach me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,
Steve McDichael</p>

<p><em>*This is a contract position for 3 months; a full-time employment offer is not guaranteed, as it depends on performance as well as culture fit.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><time datetime="2020-11-14">14 Nov 2020</time></header><h2 id="i">I.</h2><p>In 1842, Morse pressed Congress into allowing him to demonstrate his telegraph by sending a message from one congressional conference room to another. As a result, he was given about a million dollars (inflation-adjusted):</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=005/llsl005.db&amp;recNum=655"><em>(March 3, 1843)</em></a> Be it enacted… That the sum of thirty thousand dollars be… appropriated… for testing the capacity and usefulness of the system of electro-magnetic telegraphs invented by Samuel F. B. Morse… The Secretary of the Treasury [is] authorized to pay… Morse, and the persons employed under him, such sums of money as he may deem to be a fair compensation…</p></blockquote><p>Today, this seems like an astonishingly implausible story — a single person pesters Congress for a massive sum of money, and <em>gets it</em>.</p><p>This was not Morse’s first demonstration to Congress, though. It took him five years to secure funding.</p><p>In 1837, the Secretary of the Treasury (Levi Woodbury) was instructed by the House to investigate the feasibility of constructing a system of telegraphs for the United States. At the time, “telegraph” generally meant “optical telegraph”; the relays in such a system were humans, who watched one signal and then passed it on. When Woodbury called for proposals, though, Morse replied with his electromagnetic telegraph. This was the beginning of his engagement with Congress.</p><p>In 1838 and 1839, both the House and the Senate considered bills to support the development of Morse’s magnetic telegraph. In the Senate, the issue was whether to allow duty-free importation of construction materials; the House considered a bill for testing the practicality of constructing such a system (presumably with an eye towards directly financing it). Morse demonstrated the system, in 1838, to Congress and the President. Nevertheless, neither bill was ever voted on.</p><p>In 1842, Morse convinced Congress to allow him to demonstrate again. I can’t find any claim that Morse’s second demonstration was noticeably more impressive, but in 1843, Congress finally passed an appropriate for Morse and his colleagues.</p><p>Morse reported in 1844 that the line from the District to Baltimore was complete. Side note: “What hath God wrought” was not, in fact, Morse’s first transmission. The first public transmission, according to wikipedia, was “A patient waiter is no loser”. The famous “What hath God wrought” was the opening line for the D.C.-Baltimore line.</p><p>The Congressional Journal over the next decade is filled with references to petitions and bills for funding expansion of the telegraph system across the country. Congress wasn’t just pleased with the telegraph, though. Morse’s demonstration — and the fact that he delivered on his promises — had made him personally popular. In 1845, the House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds was instructed to ask Morse</p><blockquote><p>if, in his opinion, he can invent or adopt a more expeditious plan of taking the yeas and nays in this hall…</p></blockquote><p>He seems to have declined, as the House didn’t vote electronically <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Electronic-Technology/House-Technology/">until 1973</a>.</p><p>In 1845, Congress approved an expansion of the telegraph system to New York, and began referring to “Professor Morse” instead of “Samuel F. B. Morse”. In the subsequent years, telegraph lines were often built alongside railroads, funded by Congress in the same bill. By 1870 the magnetic telegraph reached California.</p><p>An astonishing journey, beginning with the audacity of an ordinary man to write to Congress for money.</p><h2 id="ii">II.</h2><p>Or not. To start with, Morse was no ordinary man. He was a consumate self-promoter, intensely concerned with his own reputation, and quite politically active.</p><p>Wikipedia discusses his political activites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse">at some length</a>. He published a political tract (explaining how the Catholics were conspiring to take over the country) in 1835. He ran for mayor of New York (to fight the “deep Catholic state”, I assume) in 1836. Note the timeline: neither a prelude nor an afterthought, these activites were essentially contemporary with his creation of the telegraph.</p><p>After the telegraph was well established, in the 1850s, Morse turned his attention to the question of slavery, comparing it favorably to employment, parenting, and government.</p><p>In 1871, H.R. 285 was passed, allowing a statue of Morse to be erected on government land. Morse died in 1872, and a memorial service was held in Congress. I’m assuming this service primarily focused on the telegraph, rather than his paintings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse#/media/File:Samuel_Finley_Breeze_Morse_001.jpg">not bad</a>, actually) or his support for slavey (none too popular with Congress during reconstruction, I guess).</p><h2 id="iii">III.</h2><p>Henry Hall Sherwood was a physician in New York. In the 1830s, the electromagnetic nature of the nervous system was still a relatively new discovery, and Sherwood seems to have gotten a bit over-excited. His <a href="https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/?f%5Bdrep2.authorAggregate%5D%5B%5D=Sherwood%2C+H.+H.+%28Henry+Hall%29">books</a> include case studies; for the most part, he seems to have waved magnets near his patients. He claims this cured them of various ailments. I’d laugh, but there’s an accupuncture clinic a couple blocks from my office. I’m afraid to find out whether this was classified an “essential service” during the lockdown.</p><p>Electromagnetism (or as it was often known then, “magnetism” — even when referring to phenomena we would call electric) was all the rage. A major challenge of the age was to understand the structure of the magnetic field of the Earth, although that’s slightly modern terminology — it was often referred to as “the variation of the compass”. This would be helpful, among other things, for navigation at sea: you can easily imagine that a precise model might allow the measurement of longitude. Sherwood, being an expert on the magnetic nature of the nervous system, decided to lend a hand to this closely related problem. Overall, this went about as well as you’d expect.</p><p>Like his better-known contemporary, Sherwood was bold enough to make requests directly of Congress. He petitioned the House, claiming to have invented an instrument (the <em>geometer</em>) for navigation purely from magnetic observations, and</p><blockquote><p>praying the aid of the Government of the United States in the publication of a work to explain the discoveries…</p></blockquote><p>among other things. It was proposed that he give the House a demonstration of his techniques, in June of 1838. This was voted down, and the matter dropped entirely.</p><p>That same month, Sherwood also petitioned the Senate; his petition was presented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_P._Tallmadge">Nathaniel Tallmadge</a> of New York. Like the House, on June 21st, the Senate considered and declined the possiblity of a demonstration. Sherwood’s petition was referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs, which submitted a report, presented again by Tallmadge, to the Senate on July 3rd.</p><p>Here it gets interesting. That report caused something of a stir in the scientific community. No less than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry">Joseph Henry</a>, soon to become the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, published a denunciation of the report. You can read his article <a href="https://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/JHPVol/JHPP_V4_P75-79_Transcript.pdf">here</a>, which was written in protest</p><blockquote><p>against the plan of discussing such subjects in Congress before proper means have been taken to determine their true character.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, against Congressional meddling and speculation. Most of Henry’s complaint is taken up by a somewhat detailed critique (occasionally, mockery) of Sherwood’s theories. The above quote somewhat masks Henry’s true opinion. A few paragraphs later he writes:</p><blockquote><p>we do not believe that there is a person of any scientific reputation in our country, who has paid attention to this subject, who will not immediately say that the whole affair is perfectly peurile…</p></blockquote><p>Despite his earlier words, I don’t get the impression the Henry would object to Congressional support for a speculative endeavor: just not an entirely futile endeavor. After Henry’s rebuttal was published, the Senate seems to have forgotten about Sherwood’s petition for a while.</p><p>Sherwood again requested financial aid from Congress in mid-February, 1839. Another report was delivered by Tallmadge from his committee, but I can find no details on what it said. It must not have been positive: the last reference to H. H.

But just as Morse’s was not the first time the government <em>considered</em> funding science, the 1803 expedition was not the first time the U.S. government <em>considered</em> funding an expedition.</p><p>John Churchman was <a href="https://bostonraremaps.com/inventory/john-churchman-magnetic-atlas/">a surveyor and mapmaker</a>, who in the 1780s became preoccupied with the task of measuring the longitude of a ship at sea via magnetic observations (much like Sherwood!). Churchman, however, was not a complete crank. Like Morse, he was no stranger to make requests of governments, having (for instance) <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-11-02-0378">written</a> to Thomas Jefferson in 1787 to request that a paper of his be presented to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris. (That puts things in perspective. There’s no excuse for not sending cold emails!)</p><p>In 1791, Churchman made a request of Congress: “praying the patronage of Government to enable him to undertake a voyage” to investigate the magnetic fields near the geomagnetic north pole. Of course, his <em>motivation</em> for this voyage was to confirm a theory of the behavior of magnetic field lines which is now known to be incorrect. In brief, the behavior of magnetic field lines is not as predictable as he assumed, and therefore not as useful for navigation beyond distinguishing north from south.</p><p>Nevertheless, exploratory voyages based on incorrect assumptions were commonplace and often productive, and Congress considered the matter serious — more seriously, in fact, than the Sherwood business. The House held <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=003/llac003.db&amp;recNum=153">a lengthy discussion</a> on 6 Jan 1792 to consider the petition.</p><p>The representatives (at least those who participate in the debate) come across as reasonably knowledgable about the subject.

    </p>
    <p>Most of my work over the past 10 years has involved writing what is often called a <em>wizard</em>.</p>
<p>A wizard is essentially a multi-step process that guides a user through a particular workflow. For example, if you are installing a new application on your computer, the wizard might guide you through the following process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enter your license registration details</li>
<li>Agree to the software author’s legal terms</li>
<li>Specify an installation location</li>
</ol>
<p>Most web applications provide something similar. If a user needs to input a large amount of data for the application to then run a bunch of calculations, you could of course just provide the user with one big web form. At a certain size though, a single web form can be intimidating and provide a less than ideal user experience. The canonical way to improve the user experience here is to break up the web form into several separate pages. This is another example of a wizard.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://jezenthomas.com/static/img/wizard-diagram.jpg" alt="Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps"><figcaption>Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’ve tried writing wizards in a number of different web technologies, and so far Elm has proven itself as by far the most robust and painless, <em>especially</em> when it inevitably comes to changing some conditional logic to meet the mutable needs of various business processes.</p>
<p>For any small Elm application, project structure is easy. There is no reason why a 1,000 line Elm application can’t live in a single file. In fact this is really how every Elm application ought to begin its life. Start with a single file with the usual boilerplate and the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single sum type to model all of the messages your application supports</li>
<li>A single model which contains all the application state</li>
<li>A single update function for advancing the application state</li>
<li>A single view function for rendering the application state on the page</li>
</ul>
<p>If your web form is complex enough to warrant being broken into separate pages however, then your application is naturally not going to consist of a small number of lines of code. A common concern among less experienced Elm programmers is that one big sum type for all of your messages becomes unwieldy to maintain. The same is said of having one big shallow record for all of the application state, or one big <code>update</code> function to match all the constructors of the one big <code>Msg</code> type. This is where unnecessary complexity starts to balloon as programmers add <em>clever</em> abstractions and misdirections, usually involving both <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code>, separate <code>update</code> functions for each logical subsection of your application (usually with noticeably awkward type signatures), and some vague hand-waving in the direction of <em>encapsulation</em> and so-called <em>Clean Code</em>.</p>
<p>I’d argue that this kind of misdirection is almost <em>never</em> what you want. I’d argue further that this applies <em>especially</em> to you if your background is in maintaining complex React/Angular applications, where invented complexity is the status quo and this kind of misdirection is simply what you have become desensitised to.</p>
<p>So if the combination of <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code> are to be avoided, how can we scale an Elm application without sacrificing developer ergonomics? In short, the tricks to employ are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nested sum types</li>
<li>Nested record types</li>
<li>Nested update functions</li>
<li>Small, composable view functions</li>
<li>Function composition</li>
<li>Lenses</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at a more concrete application of these ideas. As an example, we can model the process of a person applying for a bank loan.</p>
<p>The bank will want to ask the applicant a whole bunch of questions, which we could group into three categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Personal information</li>
<li>Details on the purpose of the loan</li>
<li>Financial information and creditworthiness</li>
</ol>
<p>This would suggest a three-step wizard or a three-page web form. A reasonable place to begin splitting our application apart into three smaller pieces is in our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-msg-type">The Big Msg Type</h2>
<p>The naïve way to model the messages our application should support is with one big sum type, which might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type Page
  = PersonalInformationPage
  | LoanPurposePage
  | FinancialDetailsPage

type Msg
  -- System-wide messages
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  -- etc…

  -- Personal information
  | SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- …more messages for the personal information page

  -- Purpose of the loan
  | SetPurchaseItemCategory
  | SetPurchaseItemEstimatedValue
  -- …more messages for the loan purpose page

  -- Financial information
  | SetMonthlyIncomeBeforeTax
  | SetMonthlyRentPayment
  -- …more messages about the applicant's financial details</code></pre>
<p>This <em>does</em> work, but at some point it becomes cumbersome to support a large number of constructors. The value for “large” is of course determined by the individual programmer’s personal taste and/or pain threshold. To ease this pain, people typically <em>extract</em> groups of messages into their own separate sum types, which subsequently forces them to write update functions that return a type <em>other</em> than the top-level <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<p><em>Don’t do that!</em></p>
<p>The way to break these groups of constructors out is by first nesting them inside the <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>type PersonalInformationMsg
  = SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- etc..

type LoanPurposeMsg -- etc…

type FinancialDetailsMsg -- etc…

type Msg
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  | PersonalInformationMsg PersonalInformationMsg
  | LoanPurposeMsg LoanPurposeMsg
  | FinancialDetailsMsg FinancialDetailsMsg</code></pre>
<p>The new message types can live in the same file as the top-level <code>Msg</code> type. They can also be extracted to different files. That’s your choice.</p>
<p>The next thing to tackle is our <code>update</code> function, since it needs to mirror our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="nested-update-functions">Nested Update Functions</h2>
<p>I’ve seen people advocate for page-specific <code>update</code> functions which take a page-specific model and return a tuple of that page-specific model and a page-specific <code>Cmd Msg</code> equivalent. This is typically where you see <code>Cmd.map</code> sneaking in. These functions almost inevitably end up needing <em>something</em> from the top-level application-wide state, so you’ll often see some type signature like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation
   : PersonalInformationMsg
  -&gt; Model
  -&gt; (PersonalInformationModel, Cmd PersonalInformationMsg)
  -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)</code></pre>
<p>This is <em>way</em> too complex already, and this approach doesn’t even actually buy you anything.</p>
<p>The far simpler way to do this is to have every nested <code>update</code> function take a page-specific message, the <em>entire</em> application state, and return the same type for that state along with the top-level <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName a    -&gt; -- …
  SetLastName a     -&gt; -- …
  SetAddressLine1 a -&gt; -- …
  -- etc…

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model = case msg of
  NoOp -&gt; (model, Cmd.none)
  SetPage page -&gt; ({ model | page = page }, Cmd.none)
  PersonalInformationMsg subMsg -&gt; updatePersonalInformation subMsg model
  LoanPurposeMsg subMsg -&gt; updateLoanPurpose subMsg model
  FinancialDetailsMsg subMsg -&gt; updateFinancialDetails subMsg model</code></pre>
<p>No complicated type signatures. No juggling of message types. No <code>Cmd.map</code>. Easy.</p>
<p>Of course the whole point of our <code>update</code> function is to advance the state of our model, and the structure of that model is also something that can swell and become unwieldy, so that’s what we will dissect next.</p>
<h2 id="record-surgery">Record Surgery</h2>
<p>Near the inception of the project, all of our individual bits of state might exist at the top level of our <code>Model</code>, which is typically represented as a record. Perhaps something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , addressLine1 : String
  -- …more personal information fields

  , purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …more loan purpose fields…

  -- …and also financial details, and system-wide state, etc…
  }</code></pre>
<p>Like the parts of our project we’ve addressed previously, this also can turn into a bit of a mess as it grows. Both application-wide data and page-specific data are mixed in together which feels a bit haphazard. Fortunately, grouping and extracting these fields is typically rather intuitive. We can start by grouping page-specific parts of the state together, and then group further until it no longer <em>feels</em> messy.</p>
<pre><code>type alias Address =
  { line1 : String
  , line2 : String
  , city : String
  , postcode : String
  -- …
  }

type alias PersonalInformation =
  { firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , address : Address
  -- …
  }

type alias LoanPurpose =
  { purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …
  }

type alias FinancialDetails = -- …

type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , personalInformation : PersonalInformation
  , loanPurpose : LoanPurpose
  , financialDetails : FinancialDetails
  }</code></pre>
<p>The problem now however is that when we wish to update a deeply-nested field, we need to write all of the code to unwrap each level until we arrive at the depth we need. Illustrated another way, let’s say we want to update the first line of the applicant’s address.</p>
<p>Retrieving the value of this field is no problem, as we can use Elm’s dot syntax to succinctly get us all the way there, like this:</p>
<pre><code>model.personalInformation.address.line1</code></pre>
<p>What we <em>can’t</em> do here however is <em>update</em> that field in a similar fashion, <em>i.e.</em>, Elm won’t allow us to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>-- This won't work
{ model.personalInformation.address | line1 = newLine1 }

-- This also won't work
{ model | personalInformation.address.line1 = newLine1 }</code></pre>
<p>The naïve way to unwrap and subsequently update the field in this record is to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetLastName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetAddressLine1 newLine1 -&gt;
    let
        …</code></pre></article></div></div>

<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>


<pre title="">const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();
</pre>


<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(commitment) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData

async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {

      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const storedCommitment = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50, 114));
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);
    if (!(await sodium.sodium_memcmp(storedCommitment, commitment))) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect commitment value");
    }
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<p>Shocking news! In an incredible breakthrough for American mass-transit engineering, the transportation technology company Virgin Hyperloop this past weekend successfully moved two people 500 meters across the barren Las Vegas desert at a top speed of just over 100 mph, setting a new world record for the absolute most pitiful thing anyone not named “Elon Musk” has ever tried to pass off as “high-speed rail.”</p>



<p>Here’s video of the shameful display:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Watch people travel in Virgin Hyperloop for the first time" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZruVz3Ccjk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Virgin Hyperloop, an American company despite the Richard Branson branding, proposes to use a combination of magnetic levitation, or “maglev”—a decades-old technology that has been in commercial operation moving real trains filled with real people in, for example, Shanghai, China, at speeds up to 268 miles per hour, for <em>17 goddamn years</em>—and “vactrain,” a concept design for an enclosed, artificially evacuated tunnel where air resistance may be as low as in the upper parts of Earth’s atmosphere, theoretically allowing for much higher top speeds at much lower levels of energy consumption. It is so goddamn embarrassing to type this. France’s electric TGV system has been in regular commercial operation for nearly 40 years; in April of 2007 one of its trains hit 357 miles per hour in a test.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/08/tech/virgin-hyperloop-passengers/index.html">CNN’s article about this event</a> paraphrases a Virgin Hyperloop executive claiming that the hyperloop pods “can travel at the speed of aircraft.” Which is true, in the sense that commercial aircraft with dozens if not hundreds of people aboard do sometimes travel at 100 miles per hour, on the ground, for seconds at a time, during takeoff or landing, when they are going only a fraction as fast as they’re capable of going. It is also true in the sense that, strictly speaking, a paper airplane is a form of “aircraft,” and you can really whip some of those suckers across a room. A more accurate but perhaps less flattering claim would be that my Honda Odyssey can travel at the fastest speed Virgin Hyperloop has yet attained, and with <em>four times as many people riding in it</em>.</p>



<p>Hell, for that matter, as <a href="https://twitter.com/leftistthot420/status/1326561247333134336">a Twitter user</a> helpfully pointed out, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNER_Class_A4_4468_Mallard">a freaking <em>steam locomotive</em> hit 126 miles per hour</a> in England, 82 years ago, in 1938.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, but, when it’s done, it’ll go 600 miles per hour</em>, you’re whining, <em>and it’ll have 25 to 30 people in a pod!</em> When exactly will that be? France opened the TGV in 1981. Japan’s oldest high-speed line debuted in 1964—<em>1964!</em>—and was better and faster then than Amtrak’s Acela trains go now. Shanghai’s maglev train has been operable since John Kerry was campaigning to unseat George W. Bush as president. Measure speed by the number of riders the respective services will have moved by, say, 2050. Measure it in carbon emissions. By the year 2020, the best-funded and most sophisticated high-speed rail developer in the United States moved two (2) people 500 meters.</p>



<p>The United States is generations behind much of the rest of the wealthy, industrialized world in this area. For all but a very narrow corridor along the East Coast serviced by the weak half-a-loaf shit that passes for high-speed rail in this country, the best an American commuter can hope for in intercity rail options are crappy and ancient diesel Amtrak trains that top out at around 80 miles per hour. Most American cities simply are not serviced by any intercity rail network at all. The U.S.’s shameful mass-transit situation—and thus its shameful dependence on personal vehicles, and all the downstream bad shit that comes from that—could be improved a zillion percent by just aiming for the level of railroad sophistication French people considered normal before the median 2020 French person was old enough to ride a bicycle. And here are these Professor Frink–ass Hyperloop dinguses, dumping resources beyond counting into inventing some shit that already exists when for a fraction of the cost and in a fraction of the time they could just <em>purchase</em> or at the very least <em>copy</em> what is already working just fine even in backward-ass doofus countries like freaking Italy. It wouldn’t need test tracks! It wouldn’t need years of iteration and development! They already did all that shit, all over the rest of the world! </p>



<p>In a vacuum (a figurative one: an alternate universe in which the rest of the post-industrial world were not absolutely goddamn <em>bursting</em> with operating networks of authentic high-speed rail; where high-speed rail were not already such a well-developed form of transit that the TGV system, which routinely moves huge numbers of day-to-day commuters across large distances of France at speeds well more than twice that achieved by this sad two-person billion-dollar pod going from nowhere to nowhere across a tiny patch of worthless desert, were not both infinitely better and more sophisticated than any presently available commercial rail in the United States <em>and</em> fairly outmoded in comparison to newer [yet still not all that new!] systems in China and Japan and elsewhere) the Virgin Hyperloop could almost look like an impressive accomplishment. Alas, here in the world of context, its only real accomplishment is a promotional one. The business of the American technology sector and its attendant courtier press is to continually recreate and exploit something like a vacuum in the public’s awareness of what the larger world is like, so that clueless observers will congratulate a bunch of boobs for “inventing” a shittier, more expensive version of something that is already regarded as boring and normal—fast, energy-efficient rail service!—pretty much everywhere outside of this stupid and embarrassing country.</p>



<p>Everything about the broken incentives and hollowed-out capacities of American society is crystallized in this dumb pod moseying its way along a track to nowhere in Las Vegas. The United States has a problem: It is too dependent on inefficient, dirty, and expensive forms of transportation, because the vast majority of its people have no practical access to other kinds. Its infrastructure and the health of its communities are all jacked up by the necessity of splattering asphalt all over everything in order for people to drive their big dumb cars to, and park them near, anywhere they’d decide to go. It cannot achieve efficient levels of density or make meaningful turns toward environmental responsibility for as long as this is the case. Thankfully, a solution to this problem already exists and is in operation throughout other parts of the world with comparable levels of wealth and technological capacity: Trains! Networks of fast-moving trains that do not need internal combustion engines in order to move lots of people very quickly along their tracks! Companies and agencies make and install and operate these train systems, and have been doing so for a long time, longer even than the lifetime of the graybeard crap-bag writing this blog. They know how to do it! They can probably just be hired to do it. At some level somebody can probably just buy some of those trains, and install them, and turn them on, and take people from here to there on them.</p>



<p>But who could make it happen? Broke-dick, systematically impoverished municipalities, lashed to budget-balancing like a cinderblock tied to their feet? Close your eyes and try to imagine how a sane and obviously good decision like <em>Just import the TGV and run it between the big American cities instead of spending years and fortunes inventing maglev from scratch for no reason</em> could get made in these United States. Imagine who’d make it, and what their goals would be, and where the money would come from. It simply can’t get made on those terms. It can’t get made at all. No level of American society even has a mechanism for that anymore. If it doesn’t require a messianic assbrain with a Steve Jobs cosplay fantasy pitching some sleepy billionaire or venture capital firm on the possibility of cornering the market on a brand-new technology that will conquer the world, then it will not get done. If it merely delivers a profound benefit to the common good rather than the promise of extravagant enrichment to a shrinking class of hyper-powered parasites, then it simply cannot exist.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>Information and its abundance</h2>
<p>There has been a strange world in the post generations of iPhone. Some updates didn’t change a thing from the user perspective.</p>
<p>Both in hardware, software and design. The updates that basically either forced you to buy a new phone or updates that were talked about as revolutionary didn’t do anything.</p>
<p>That is a crazy thing to think about. We live in a world of constant information overdrive. There is just too much information for us to waste our time looking and investing in something sub-par.</p>
<p>There has been a concept that the most successful writers and content creator have been using to get the best reach and get the biggest impact from their content.</p>
<p>It was to make the best content that is different from the mass. Make it so that people are eager to get more content from you with your personal style embedded.</p>
<h2>Apple disappointing</h2>
<p>Apple has been putting out content in each of their conferences that didn’t really move anyone it seems.</p>
<p>Yes, it is something new, but it is not something completely new like the iPad or iPhone or iPod was. There is nothing revolutionary coming any more.</p>
<p><img alt="iPhone one 1" src="https://i.gyazo.com/af09e6e1c58052507af91c5dcedaebbc.jpg"></p>
<p>There can be 3 reasons for this in my opinion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of the upgrades these days is switching old, manual algorithm that hard-coded behaviour and responses are being switched to faster and more advanced and flexible machine learning and neural networks algorithms. So, the most significant change for the iPhone is happening under the hood, which is not really seen until Apple can do some really crazy stuff after everything is integrated.</li>
<li>The death of Steve Jobs has been too big of a blow on the creative and time side. He propelled people into new gadgets and forced deadlines. He was the most passionate person in making money and creating something so huge and amazing that everyone would want it.</li>
<li>There is a technological limit being hit. The biggest thing these days with all the hardware manufacturers is that their progress is about to slow down as there is not enough technology to make their products faster and quieter and smaller. NVidia is using machine learning to boost their graphics cards. AMD has had to resort to neural networks to boost their performance. Intel has been stuck with the same idea of improving their product from 2000.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this is either very exciting or very disappointing. </p>
<p>It means that maybe, just maybe, there is a huge technological breakthrough coming in the couple of years that will bring the whole industry upside down.</p>
<p>Or it means that we have hit a plateau in the technology field and their technology will be more of a tool to work on other components of life, rather than being the biggest focus.</p>
<p>I am not sure what it is, but I see that our life will be very different from what it is right now in 10 years. Not even taking coronavirus into account.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>As we know, technology is like a weapon that can either make you a villain if misused or a hero if used correctly.</p>
<p>Technology is just like that. You can either destroy your life by being a slave to social media and other forms of time wasters. Or you can elevate yourself to the next level by creating, learning, and researching with it.</p>
<p>What matters the most to the normal human being is not what you have, but how you use it.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s iPhone 12 or iPhone 24. What matters is what you do with it.</p>
<p>Like with everything, you need to work your way from the bottom:</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Lately, I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us">Among Us</a> with my friends. It’s a refreshing change of pace from the competitive FPS titles that we usually play. However, we’ve managed to inject a ‘healthy’ dose of competitiveness into our games in the form of a league that I built some software for. </p>
<p>We recently crossed the 100 game mark and players have been making feature requests and also submitting PRs! It has been open sourced at <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/among-us-friends">healeycodes/among-us-friends</a>.</p>
<p>The league website is a Node/Express application that calculates a player’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo rating</a> — a relative measure of one player’s skill against another — as well as other performance statistics like crew/imposter win rate. It ranks players and graphs their recent performance on the home page. </p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/a9004cf01205c12f8f4532e6833d8e63/f5f2a/preview.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

    </span></p>
<p>When a player goes to their auto-generated player page, they can see a history of their games and who played on each side, the amount of Elo they won or lost each game, and an Elo history graph for the whole season.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/b9b2a7db52b7a621dcd9dafadeb91166/3ffe4/preview-player.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>I manually track each game we play in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This data is brought into the application via the Google Sheets API v4. To set this up, I grabbed the spreadsheets ID (which can be copied straight from the URL bar) and created a restricted API key via Google Console.</p>
<p>The data arrives in a series of rows with each row representing one game. An Among Us game can be split up into three parts of data. </p>
<ul>
<li>The crew (7 or 8 players)</li>
<li>The imposters (2 players)</li>
<li>The winner (crew or imposters)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since a spreadsheet cannot be efficiently queried, and page requests are unlikely to exceed 0.15/s, and the amount of data will grow linearly, we bring in all the rows on every request (Sheets API usage is unlimited and free).</p>
<p>There is a performance cost to recalculating the statistics but this can be solved in the future with caching. The performance cost for each additional game is a constant amount so, loosely, we could say that the cost of generating league statistics grows at the same rate as additional games. It has a time complexity of <code>O(n)</code>.</p>
<p>A player object is built for each person in the league and the following information is calculated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crew wins/losses</li>
<li>Imposter wins/losses</li>
<li>Current Elo</li>
<li>Elo history</li>
<li>Their game history</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="elo-ratings"><a href="#elo-ratings" aria-label="elo ratings permalink"></a>Elo ratings</h2>
<p>For Elo calculations, I use the npm package <code>elo-rating</code>. In the Elo rating methodology, the <em>K-factor</em> is the maximum possible adjustment for a game. I have based the league’s system off the International Chess Federation’s rules. Before a player reaches 30 games, their rating is more volatile. After 30 games, their K-factor drops from 40 to 20.</p>
<p>Elo was designed for games with two players. I was initially unsure how to solve the problem of Among Us having different team sizes. Other people have created rating systems for Among Us that separate a measure of a player’s skill into crew/imposter. However, I made a product decision to reduce a player’s performance down to a single number. As a result, a player is compared against the average Elo of the side they are playing against.</p>
<p>We alter our game settings (e.g. crew vision, kill cooldown) over time to encourage a 50/50 win rate of crew and imposter teams. Even if the win rate is skewed, the effects on a player’s general rating will even out in the long run because players will have a similar number of games on each side (20% imposter, 80% crew).</p>
<p>Elo systems in video games are not tuned to be mathematically perfect but to reward and encourage players — a mixture of fun and correctness.

All the tests are ran on commit/PR using GitHub Actions with the default Node YAML file that runs the following commands across the three latest versions of Node.</p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code>    <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> npm ci
    <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> npm run build <span>-</span><span>-</span>if<span>-</span>present

<h2 id="charts-and-pages"><a href="#charts-and-pages" aria-label="charts and pages permalink"></a>Charts and pages</h2>
<p>For the line graphs that chart player ratings, I use Chart.js. There is a shared graph function for the home page and the player page. It takes an array of Elo history and a <code>sample</code> argument which allows the home page to show the last 30 games and the player pages to show all of the season’s games.</p>
<p>The home page generates a list of players and their graphs after hitting an endpoint of the application that sends back a blob of statistics. In the future, depending on the size of the player base, this will need to allow querying specific players. For now, the page load cost of this is imperceivable (i.e. sub-100ms).</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/stats"</span><span>)</span>

    </code></pre></div>
<p>All pages use a similar pattern of serving a HTML page that contains a loading message that is removed when the data is fetched and the rest of the page is built. There is no framework and the JavaScript is unprocessed.</p>
<h2 id="deployment"><a href="#deployment" aria-label="deployment permalink"></a>Deployment</h2>
<p>I manually deploy and maintain the application via Glitch. I import the latest changes from the default GitHub branch and any changes to the <code>package.json</code> file are reconciled. This means there is ~20 seconds of downtime. The Glitch IDE allows for hotfixing in production (or even development), as well as viewing application logs, and a terminal window that connects to an SSH session.</p>

<p>I started this project by coding directly in Glitch’s browser IDE which can export to a GitHub repository’s <code>glitch</code> branch where PRs can be created. After a while, I took development offline when users started visiting the website more often.</p>
<p>My current workflow is: develop locally, check tests locally, create PR, check the CI tests, merge to main, go to Glitch, and import from GitHub.</p>
<p>I also added a route <code>/raw-stats</code> so that myself and other developers can work with read-only production data when we work locally.</p>
<h2 id="feedback"><a href="#feedback" aria-label="feedback permalink"></a>Feedback</h2>
<p>Like most online games that have rating systems, there have been comments about the fairness of the rating system. As of writing, the key unsolved problem is that the player’s team is not taken into account (only the opposing team’s rating is used). If you are paired with new players, or very experienced players, the probability of you winning a game is altered but not captured in the Elo calculations.</p>
<p>A player on a strong team should be rewarded less for their win and vice versa. The change required to implement this is to ‘walk’ the player’s Elo towards the average of their team before determining their rating change after a game.</p></section></div>]]>

November 13, 2020 | https://darkbit.io/blog/announcing-opencspm | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://darkbit.io/blog/announcing-opencspm">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <div>
      <p>OpenCSPM is an open-source platform developed by <a href="https://darkbit.io/">Darkbit</a> that aims to make continuous cloud security posture assessments of cloud environments a practical reality for security and compliance teams alike.  It offers a unique approach to manage the firehose of security and compliance check results that can even modest AWS and GCP environments can surface, and its control definitions allow for simple yet powerful levels of introspection of its graph data model.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-we-build-opencspm">Why Did We Build OpenCSPM?</h2>

<p>Performing cloud-native and Kubernetes security posture assessments is our laser-focus at <a href="https://darkbit.io/services">Darkbit</a>, and helping our customers at every stage of their journey manage appropriate levels of risk in their environments is what drives us.  With every engagement, we learn more and more about what drives our customers and the contributing factors to their cloud security challenges.  Overwhelmingly, the challenge is getting control of and keeping control of security risks in ever-growing and changing cloud environments.  It’s just too much data, too often, and the surface area keeps expanding.</p>

<p><img src="https://darkbit.io/img/opencspm-demo-search.gif" alt="OpenCSPM Demo Search"></p>

<p>There are several SaaS offerings and open-source tools that focus in this space, but our perspective as a two-person consulting company made us see and feel a lot of our customers’ pain.  It highlighted multiple areas that we wanted to address differently, and we felt the community could benefit from our lessons learned.</p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-seen">What Have We Seen?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can’t manage what you can’t see. Without a complete inventory, you’re flying blind when it comes to cloud security posture management.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Incomplete Collection Coverage</strong> - Many solutions don’t have the capability to collect the metadata from all available cloud resources.  They tend to focus on the core types of compute, networking, database, and IAM service resources which means the results are by definition limited in completeness.  What do you do if you use a service that your CSPM solution doesn’t even look at?</li>
  <li><strong>Data Ownership</strong> - Many solutions are delivered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and provide quick onboarding experiences, but they inherently are a third-party with account-wide or organization-wide “read-only/security audit” access to your cloud resources.  This may present challenges with data ownership, compliance attestations of an external third party, and adherence to regional compliance mandates.</li>
  <li><strong>Customization</strong> - Solutions can vary widely in their ability to make adjustments to how data is collected, how security checks are defined, how results are filtered/excluded and reported, and how and when teams are alerted for issues.  Without full control over all aspects, you may end up with results and notifications that cannot be properly tuned, and this can lead to ignoring the tool and overall alert fatigue.</li>
  <li><strong>Answering Complex Questions</strong> - All CSPM solutions can answer “Is this S3 Bucket Public?”, but very few of them can answer questions like “Are there any publicly accessible virtual machines with attached instance credentials that allow reading from S3 buckets tagged ‘sensitive’?” or “Which GKE Clusters have pods with access to escalate to ‘Project Owner’ via the attached Service Account?”</li>
  <li><strong>Point-in-Time vs Continuous</strong> - A solution designed with tunable results tracking and results triage workflows across multiple assessment intervals in mind is a giant upgrade in value from running a tool every day and getting the report in your inbox.</li>
  <li><strong>Unattainable Perfection</strong> - The concept of reaching “zero” failing checks is much like reaching “Inbox Zero”. If you can, it’s short-lived, but it may never be possible with certain requirements in place.  Being able to calibrate the tool to <strong>your baseline</strong> instead of <strong>perfection</strong> is the only way to make the results stay meaningful and accurate.  Having a list of failing issues delivered to your inbox every day that you know you can’t fix dilutes the value of those results by increasing the cognitive load and context required to make use of them.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on Compliance</strong> - Most security practitioners are aware of the differences between an environment that is only compliant with one that is compliant and also well hardened.  Compliance is a key driver for obtaining project funding and being able to operate their business legally, but going no further than compliance still leaves you open to critical risks.  Cloud security posture assessment tools don’t often cover both security best practices and compliance objectives equally.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-goals">Design Goals</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make answering the simple questions simple and answering even the most complex questions possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Support for cloud providers, Kubernetes resources, and other related types of data types using a standardized approach</strong> - OpenCSPM is targeting AWS, GCP, and soon, Kubernetes resources, but adding other types of data like Identity mapping, container image vulnerability metadata, and more are on the roadmap.  Resources are to be collected in a standardized JSON format using dedicated collection mechanisms and delivered to cloud storage buckets like GCS and/or S3.</li>
  <li><strong>Separation of Collection from Analysis</strong> - Scanning/collecting and then analyzing the data from a single tool is convenient, but when deployed into a cloud account, it becomes quite the target for an attacker. Having processes with just enough permissions to collect the data and write to a bucket separate from the system that ingests/analyzes that data helps minimize that risk, but it also enables more flexible deployment scenarios for larger organizations with multiple teams, each with their own levels of access to the data.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced Data Model</strong> - Answering lots of complex questions of this inventory and configuration data requires parsing and storing the data with relationships intact.  A graph database is best suited for this task, and it provides a window to this data that makes answering the simple questions simple and answering even the most complex questions possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Campaigns as Workflows</strong> - When making the cost of checking thousands of settings across multiple accounts extremely cheap and quick, even small organizations will generate an overwhelming amount of results they have to manage.  The most important results can be triaged and tracked in one or more “campaigns”, and this is the touchpoint where activities such as filtering and notifications can be handled.  You should be in full control over what to care about and be notified on, not the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Full control</strong> - A platform with this much potential capability and power should be in the hands of the teams that need to get work done.  That means full control over where that system is deployed, its access model, and fine-grained control over what it checks and how it represents that data.  The system should be open and transparent about what it’s doing.  More importantly, you should be able to know what it’s <strong>not</strong> doing.</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance Objectives and Tagging</strong> - It should be possible to associate controls with one or more compliance requirements with relative ease, and the user interface, filtering, and workflows should be driven from those tags.  For example, filtering controls by “PCI”, “NIST 800-53”, or “CIS” should narrow down the list to the controls that align with those frameworks with an identical mechanism that can also be used to filter controls for “lateral movement” or “privilege escalation”.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="who-is-opencspm-for">Who Is OpenCSPM For?</h2>

<p>Organizations looking for an open-source solution to help them gain more complete control over how cloud security posture data is collected, analyzed, measured, and handled on a continuous basis.  For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security Teams looking for a way to identify cloud security risks and automatically track the progress down to a desired baseline across the entire organization.</li>
  <li>Compliance Teams looking for a more complete picture of adherence to and deviations from the various compliance frameworks and a way to measure and track those statistics over time.</li>
  <li>Development and Operations Teams looking for continuous and early feedback during greenfield infrastructure development to avoid surprises when Security or Compliance Teams review said infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Red Teams looking for common mistakes and trends in their organizations to help them devise more useful scenarios to run against their Blue Teams, and Blue Teams looking to be made aware when those common mistakes reoccur to be able to address them.</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[A GAN to generate dithers minimising frame difference for a slow movie player]]>

November 13, 2020 | http://matpalm.com/blog/dithernet_vsmp/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://matpalm.com/blog/dithernet_vsmp/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
  
<p>it's been about two years since i first saw the awesome
   <a href="https://medium.com/s/story/very-slow-movie-player-499f76c48b62">very slow movie player</a>
   project by bryan boyer. i thought it was such an excellent idea but never got around
   to buying the hardware to make one. more recently though i've seen a couple of references
   to the project so i decided it was finally time to make one.
</p>
<p>one interesting concern about an eink very slow movie player is the screen refresh. simpler
   eink screens refresh by doing a full cycle of a screen of white or black before displaying
   the new image. i hated the idea of an ambient slow player doing this every few minutes
   as it switched frames, so i wanted to make sure i got a piece of hardware that could do
   incremental update.
</p>
<p>after a bit of shopping around i settled on a
   <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/6inch-hd-e-paper-hat.htm">6 inch HD screen from waveshare</a>
</p>
<p>it ticks all the boxes i wanted
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     6 inch
 </li>

 <li>
     1448×1072 high definition
 </li>

 <li>
     comes with a raspberry pi HAT
 </li>

 <li>
     and, most importantly, support partial refresh
 </li>
</ul>
<p>this screen also supports grey scale, but only with a flashy full cycle redraw,
   so i'm going to stick to just black and white since it supports the partial redraw.
</p>
<p>note: even though the partial redraw is basically instant it does suffer from a ghosting problem;
   when you draw a white pixel over a black one things are fine, but if you draw black over
   white, in the partial redraw, you get a slight ghosting of gray that is present until a
   full redraw :/
</p>


<p>so how do you display an image when you can only show black and white?
   dithering! here's an example of a 384x288 RGB image dithered using
   <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.convert">PILS implementation of the Floyd-Steinberg algorithm</a>
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/eg.dither.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td>original RGB vs dithered version</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>it makes intuitive sense that you could have small variations in the exact locations of the
   dots as long as you get the densities generally right. s
   so there's a reasonable question then; how do you dither in such a way that you get a
   good result, but with minimal pixel changes from a previous frame? (since we're
   motivated on these screens to change as little as possible)
</p>
<p>there are two approaches i see
</p>
<p>1) spend 30 minutes googling for a solution that no doubt someone came up with 20 years
   ago that can be implemented in 10 lines of c running at 1000fps ...
</p>
<p>2) .... or train an
   <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/">jax</a>
   based GAN to generate the dithers with a loss balancing a good dither vs no pixel change. :P
</p>


<p>when building a very slow movie player the most critical decision is...
   what movie to play?
   i really love the 1979 classic <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/">alien</a>,
   it's such a great dark movie, so i thought i'd go with it.
   the movie is 160,000 frames so at a play back rate of a frame every 200 seconds
   it'll take just over a year to finish.
</p>
<p>note that in this type of problem there is no concern around overfitting.
   we have access to all data going in and so it's fine to overfit as much as we like;
   as long as we're minimising whatever our objective is we're good to go.
</p>


<p>i started with a
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597">unet</a>
   that maps 3 channel RGB images to a single channel dither.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/models.v1.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td>v1 architecture</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>i tinkered a bit with the architecture but didn't spend too much time tuning it.
   for the final v3 result i ended with a pretty vanilla stack of encoders &amp; decoders
   (with skip connections connecting an encoder to the decoder at the same spatial resolution)
   each encoder/decoder block uses a residual like shortcut around a couple of convolutions.
   nearest neighbour upsampling gave a nicer result than deconvolutions in the decoder
   for the v3 result.
   also, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415">gelu</a> is my new favorite activation :)
</p>
<p>for v1 i used a binary cross entropy loss of P(white) per pixel
   ( since it's what worked well for my
   <a href="http://matpalm.com/blog/counting_bees/">bee counting project</a> )
</p>
<p>as always i started by overfitting to a single example to get a baseline feel for capacity required.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/overfit.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v1 overfit result
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>when scaling up to the full dataset i switched to training on half resolution images
   against a patch size of 128. working on half resolution consistently gave a better
   result than working with the full resolution.
</p>
<p>as expected though this model gave us the classic type of problem we see with
   straight unet style image translation; we get a reasonable sense of the shapes, but no
   fine details around the dithering.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v1.upsample.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v1 vanilla unet with upsampling example
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>side notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     for this v1 version using deconvolutions in the decoder
     (instead of nearest neighbour upsampling) actually looked pretty good!
     nicely captured texture for a dither with a surprisingly small network.
 </li>

 <li>
     i actually did some experiments using branches in the decoder for both upsampling
     and deconvolutions but the deconvs always dominated too much. i thought that would
     allow the upsampling to work as a kind of residual to the deconv but it never happened.

   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004">pix2pix</a>
   objective but reasonably quickly moved to use a
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875">wasserstein</a>
   critic style objective since i've always found it more stable.
</p>
<p>the generator (G) was the same as the unet above with the discriminator (D) running patch based.
   at this point i also changed the reconstruction loss from a binary objective to just L1.
   i ended up using batchnorm in D, but not G.
   to be honest i only did a little did of manual tuning, i'm sure there's a better result
   hidden in the hyperparameters somewhere.
</p>
<p>so, for this version, the loss for G has two components
</p>
<pre>1. D(G(rgb))             # fool D
2. L1(G(rgb), dither)    # reconstruct the dither
</pre>

<p>very quickly (i.e. in &lt; 10mins ) we get a reasonable result that is started to
   show some more detail than just the blobby reconstruction.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v2.eg.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v2 partial trained eg
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>note: if the loss weight of 2) is 0 we degenerate to v1
   (which proved a useful intermediate debugging step).
   at this point i didn't want to tune to much since the final v3 is coming...
</p>


<p>for v3 we finally introduce a loss relating the previous frame
   (which was one of the main intentions of the project in the first place)
</p>
<p>now G takes not just the RGB image, but the dither of the previous frame.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/models.v3.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v3 architecture
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>the loss for G now has three parts
</p>
<pre>1. D(G(rgb_t1)) =&gt; real      # fool D
2. L1(G(rgb_t1), dither_t1)  # reconstruct the dither
3. L1(G(rgb_t1), dither_t0)  # don't change too much from the last frame
</pre>

<p>normally with a network that takes as input the same thing it's outputting
   we have to be careful to include things like teacher forcing.
   but since we don't intend to use this network for any kind of rollouts
   we can just always feed the "true" dithers in where required.
   having said that, rolling out the dithers from this network would be interesting :D
</p>


<p>the third loss objective, not changing too many pixels from the last frame,
   works well for generally stationary shots
   but is disastrous for scene changes :/
</p>
<p>consider the following graph for a sequence of frames showing the pixel difference
   between frames.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/pixel_diff_between_scenes.png"></p><p>when there is a scene change we observe a clear "spike" in pixel diff. my first thought
   was to look for these and do a full redraw for them. it's very straightforward to
   find them (using a simple z-score based anomaly detector on a sliding window) but
   the problem is that it doesn't pick up the troublesome case of a panning shot where we don't
   have a scene change exactly. in these cases there is no abrupt scene change, but there
   are a lot of pixels changing so we end up seeing a lot of ghosting.
</p>
<p>i spent ages tinkering with the best way to approach this before deciding that a simple
   approach of <code>num_pixels_changed_since_last_redraw &gt; threshold</code> was good enough to decide
   if a full redraw was required (with a cooldown to ensure we not redrawing all the time)
</p>


<p>the v3 network gets a very good result <em>very</em> quickly; unsurprisingly since the dither at time
   t0 provided to G is a pretty good estimate of the dither at t1 :)
   i.e. G can get a good result simply by copying it!
</p>
<p>the following scenario shows this effect...
</p>
<p>consider three sequential frames, the middle one being a scene change.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.1.png"></p><p>at the very start of training the reconstruction loss is dominant and
   we get blobby outlines of the frame.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.2.png"></p><p>but as the contribution from the dither at time t0 kicks it things look good in general but
   the frames at the scene change end up being a ghosted mix attempt to copy through the old
   frame along with dithering the new one.
   (depending on the relative strength of the loss terms of G).
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.3.png"></p>
<p>so the v3 version generally works and i'm sure with some more tuning i could get a better result
   but, as luck would have it, i actually find the results from v2 more appealing when testing
   on the actual eink screen. so even though the intention was do something like v3 i'm going to end
   up running something more like v2 (as shown in these couple of examples (though the resolution
   does it no justice (not to mention the fact the player will run about 5000 times slower than these
   gifs)))
</p>




<p>i'll update this section when i get a proper frame made (though i might try myself?) but for now the
   prototype lives balanced precariously on a piece of foam below it's younger sibling pi zero eink screen
   running game of life.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/prototype.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td>prototype on desk</td></tr>
</tbody></table>



<ul>
 <li>
     for reconstruction and frame change i used L1 loss, but that's not exactly what we
     want. since we want to avoid the ghosting (white changing to black resulting in grey)
     we should try to avoid white to black but ignore black to white.
 </li>

 <li>
     we might be able to better handle scene changes by also including a
     loss component around the <em>next</em> frame.
 </li>

 <li>
     there's a padding issue where i train G on patches but when it's run on the full res
     version we get an edge artefact the size of the original patch (see image below).
     as a hacky fix i just padded the RGB image before passing it to …</li></ul></div></div>

<![CDATA[A Visual Guide to Regular Expression]]>
            </title>

November 13, 2020 | https://amitness.com/regex/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/regex/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>It’s a common task in NLP to either check a text against a pattern or extract parts from the text that matches a certain pattern. A regular expression or “regex” is a powerful tool to achieve this.</p>
<p>While powerful, regex can feel daunting as it comes with a lot of features and sub-parts that you need to remember.</p>
<p>In this post, I will illustrate the various concepts underlying regex. The goal is to help you build a good mental model of how a regex pattern works.</p>
<h2 id="mental-model">Mental Model</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example where we are trying to find the word ‘cool’ in the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-mental-model-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With regex, we could simply type out the word ‘cool’ as the pattern and it will match the word.</p>

<p>While regex matched our desired word ‘<strong>cool</strong>’, the way it operates is not at the word level but the character level. This is the key idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Idea</strong>: Regex works at the character-level, not word-level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-working.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The implication of this is that the regex <code>r'cool'</code> would match the following sentences as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-exact-word-match.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="basic-building-blocks">Basic Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the key idea, let’s understand how we can match simple characters using regex.</p>
<h3 id="a-specific-character">a. Specific character</h3>
<p>We can simply specify the character in the regular expression and it will match all instances in the text.</p>
<p>For example, a regular expression given below will match all instances of ‘a’ in the text. You can use any of the small and capital alphabets.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-only-a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also use any digits from 0 to 9 and it will work as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-python-3.7-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that regex is case-sensitive by default and thus the following regex won’t match anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-not-matched-by-capital-a.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-white-space-character">b. White space character</h3>
<p>We can detect special characters such as whitespace and newlines using special escape sequences.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-white-space-characters.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Besides the common ones above, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>\r</strong> for carriage return</li>
<li><strong>\f</strong> for form feed</li>
<li><strong>\e</strong> for escape.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-special-sequences">c. Special sequences</h3>
<p>Regex provides a bunch of built-in special symbols that can match a group of characters at once. These begin with backslash <code>\</code>.</p>
<h4 id="pattern-d">Pattern: <code>\d</code></h4>
<p>It matches any single-digit number between 0 to 9.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-single-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that matches are single digit. So we have 4 different matches below instead of a single number <code>18.04</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-ubuntu-18.04.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-s">Pattern: \s</h4>
<p>It matches any whitespace character (<span>space</span>, <span>tab</span> or <span>newline</span>).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-any-whitespace.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-w">Pattern: \w</h4>
<p>It matches any of the small alphabets(a to z), capital alphabets(A to Z), digits (0 to 9), and underscore.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-w.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-">Pattern: .</h4>
<p>It matches any character except the new line (\n).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-everything-except-newline.png" alt=""></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'.'</span><span>,</span> <span>'line 1</span><span>\n</span><span>line2'</span><span>)</span>
<span>[</span><span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>' '</span><span>,</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>'2'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="pattern-negations">Pattern: Negations</h4>
<p>If you use the capitalized versions of the patterns above, they act as negation.</p>
<p>For example, if “\d” matched any digits from 0 to 9, then “\D” will match anything except “0 to 9”.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-negation.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="d-character-sets">d. Character sets</h3>
<p>These are patterns starting with <code>[</code> and ending with <code>]</code> and specify the characters that should be matched enclosed by brackets.</p>
<p>For example, the following pattern matches any of the characters ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, and ‘u’.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-aeiou.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also replicate the functionality of <code>\d</code> using the below pattern. It will match any digits between 0 to 9.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-1-to-9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead of specifying all the digits, we can use <code>-</code> to specify only start and end digits. So, instead of <code>[0123456789]</code>, we can do:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-refactor-all-digits.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, <code>[2-4]</code> can be used to match any digits between 2 to 4 i.e. (2 or 3 or 4).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-year-2014-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can even use the special characters we learned previously inside the brackets. For example, you can match any digit from 0 to 9 or whitespace as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-whitespace-or-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Below, I have listed some useful common patterns and what they mean.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-common-pattern-for-bracket.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="e-anchors">e. Anchors</h3>
<p>Regex also has special handlers to make the pattern only match if it’s at the start or end of the string.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>^</code> anchor to match patterns only at the start of a line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-start-anchor.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Similarly, we can use the <code>$</code> anchor after the character to match patterns only if it’s the end of the line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-anchor-end.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="f-escaping-metacharacters">f. Escaping metacharacters</h3>
<p>Consider a case where we want to exactly match the word “Mr. Stark”.</p>
<p>If we write a regex like <code>Mr. Stark</code>, then it will have an unintended effect. Since we know dot has a special meaning in a regex.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-issue.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, we should always escape the special metacharacters like <code>.</code>, <code>$</code> etc. if our goal is to match the exact character itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-fixed.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the list of metacharacters that you should remember to escape if you’re using them directly.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>^ $ . * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="repetition-of-basic-blocks">Repetition of basic blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we can pattern match any characters, we could repeat things and start building more complicated patterns.</p>
<h3 id="a-naive-repetition">a. Naive repetition</h3>
<p>Using only what we have learned so far, a naive way would be to just repeat the pattern. For example, we can match two-digit numbers by just repeating the character-level pattern.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-d-slash-d.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-quantifiers">b. Quantifiers</h3>
<p>Regex provides special quantifiers to specify different types of repetition for the character preceding it.</p>
<h4 id="i-fixed-repetition">i. Fixed repetition</h4>
<p>We can use the <code>{...}</code> quantifier to specify the number of times a pattern should repeat.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-manual-counts.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the previous pattern for matching 2-digit number can be recreated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-it-is-2020.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also specify a range of repetitions using the same quantifier. For example, to match from 2-digit to 4-digit numbers, we could use the pattern:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-min-max-count.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When applied to a sentence, it will match both 4-digit and 2-digit numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-20-years-old.png" alt=""></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>
There should not be any space between minimum and maximum count For example, \d{2, 4} doesn't work.
</p>
</div>
<h4 id="ii-flexible-quantifiers">ii. Flexible quantifiers</h4>
<p>Regex also provides quantifiers “*”, “+” and “?” using which you can specify flexible repetition of a character.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>0 or 1 times</strong>: <code>?</code><br>
The <code>?</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 0 or 1 times. This can be useful to make certain parts optional. It is equivalent to <code>{0,1}</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-clarify.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to match both the word “sound” and “sound” where “s” is optional. Then, we can use the <code>?</code> quantifier that matches if a character repeats 0 or 1 times.<br>
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-example.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>one or more times</strong>: <code>+</code><br>
The <code>+</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 1 or more times. It is equivalent to <code>{1,}</code>.</p>
<p>For example, we could find numbers of any arbitrary length using the regex <code>\d+</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-example-of-plus.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>zero or more times</strong>: <code>*</code><br>
The <code>*</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats zero or more times. It is equivalent to <code>{0,}</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage-in-python">Usage in Python</h2>
<p>Python provides a module called “re” in the standard library to work with regular expression.</p>
<h3 id="need-for-raw-strings">Need for raw strings</h3>
<p>To specify a regular expression in Python, we precede it with <strong>r</strong> to create raw strings.</p>

<p>To understand why we precede with <strong>r</strong>, let’s try printing the expression <strong>\t</strong> without <code>**r**</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can see how when we don’t use raw string, the string <code>\t</code> is treated as the escape character for tab by Python.</p>
<p>Now let’s convert it into raw string. We get back whatever we specified.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>r'\t'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>
\<span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="using-re-module">Using re module</h3>
<p>To use <code>re</code> module, we can start by importing the <code>re</code> module as:</p>


<h4 id="1-refindall">1. re.findall</h4>
<p>This function allows us to get all the matches as a list of strings.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>
<span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'\d'</span><span>,</span> <span>'123456'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="2-rematch">2. re.match</h4>
<p>This function searches for a pattern at the beginning of the string and returns the first occurrence as a match object. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>This may fly in the face of conventional wisdom.</p>



<p>In the last few days Iâ€™ve watched about 20 video tutorials on blogging and read similar nubmer of articles.</p>

<p>One very common refrain from these blogging experts is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>just start writing!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great advice. My blog has languished too long because I procrastinate horribly, doing research, tweaking my wording, improving my website styling etc. â€œJust start writingâ€� is clearly the solution to all my problems, if I can do it.</p>

<p>But thereâ€™s another frequent piece of advice that seems to contradict this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>quality is king!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Time was, they say, that you could just write down your stream of consciousness and have a successful blog. No longer. Nowadays, there are so many quality content producers that you need to stand out.</p>

<p>So far, so reasonable.</p>

<p>But then they go on to say that to stay ahead in this cuthroat world of blogging, you need to <em>only publish quality content</em>.</p>

<p>This is the worst thing for me to hear.</p>

<p>Until yesterday, Iâ€™d not published anything for 21 months! The reason? I expect perfection from myself, and nothing less will do. Iâ€™m so intimidated by the enormity of the amazing ground-breaking article Iâ€™m about to write any second now that I just procrastinate starting forever.</p>



<p>In my world of web development, we have a saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">Release early, release often</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We release our products as early as we possibly can - while they only do the bare minimum and sometimes while they still have bugs. Then we make improvements fast.</p>

<p>This is for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Because itâ€™s easy for new products to get caught up in a cycle of endless tweaking and never get released, and</li>
  <li>Once itâ€™s out in the world, you can start to see how much people actually like it. You have much more knowledge</li>
</ol>

<p>Why couldnâ€™t the same theory apply to blogging?</p>



<p>One reason to be careful about â€œreleasing earlyâ€� is the potential for reputational damage. If youâ€™re well known, releasing a sub-par product could tarnish your reputation.</p>

<p>So, if a blogger like myself was trying to build a reputation, and their success depended on this reputation, then you would want to be very careful about publishing sub-par content.</p>

<p>However, my experiene of blogging so far is that basically none of my readers know who I am. They find my posts through Google (other search engines are available), read that post, and bugger off. I suspect this is how most blogs are consumed.</p>

<p>Even if people find my articles through, say, my Twitter feed (where hopefully they at least vaguely know who I am), theyâ€™re still only going to click on the articles that look good to them.</p>

<p>If Iâ€™m right about this, it really doesnâ€™t matter how much crap content you produce, as long as you produce <em>some</em> good content. And if youâ€™ve written a bad article that no-one visits, you can always improve it later to make it a good one.</p>



<p>As I <a href="https://robinwinslow.uk/2020/11/13/i-am-a-blogger/">mentioned yesterday</a>, Iâ€™m currently trying to revive my blog. Iâ€™m going to do this by setting the bar for publishing content very low for myself, and hoping to publish daily. At least for a while.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not going to spend a long time on editing, or let myself expect too much of my posts. Iâ€™m just going to do what I can.</p>

<p>This is my second post in 2 days. So far so good, I guess.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s see how it goes from here.</p>

The sensors can take temperature readings everywhere a fiber is placed, thereby generating a continuous heat diagram of a given site – even if the site stretches for dozens of kilometers. That provides crucial insight into possible accidents before they happen.</p><h2><b>Improving signal quality</b></h2><p>Working in association with the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fenglish.bupt.edu.cn%2F&amp;t=Zjc2Y2ZlNmJiYWZmOWFiNDdhZmEyNzhlMTY5OGI3MmRhYjk1ZDAxYSx6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605601499">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a>, two GFO engineers – postdoc Zhisheng Yang and PhD student Simon Zaslawski – developed a new system for encoding and decoding data sent along the fibers. With their method, sensors can receive higher-energy signals and decode them faster, resulting in measurements taken more rapidly and over a larger area. Their research <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-19201-1&amp;t=MjMyMmI1MDFkNGY0YmIzOWYzZjdmNDlkYTNiNDBlNzgzMDQ5MmE2OCx6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605601499">has just been published in <i>Nature Communications</i>.</a></p><p>The engineers describe their system as working like an echo. If you shout a single word, you hear that word back. But if you sing out a song, what you hear back is a blend of sounds that are hard to distinguish. You would need a “key” to decipher the sounds and make them intelligible. Fiber optic sensors function in a similar manner, except that an instrument sends out light pulses – rather than sounds – along a fiber. Signals bounce back up the fiber and a device decodes them, turning the signals into usable data.</p><p>To make the sensors more efficient, Yang and Zaslawski grouped the light pulses into sequences so that the signals bounce back with greater intensity. However, that didn’t solve the “echo” problem – that is, finding a key to make the signals readable. So they developed a method for encoding the data sent along a fiber; their method employs special genetic optimization algorithms to cope with imperfections. “Other systems are either limited in scope or expensive,” says Thévenaz. “But with ours, you just have to add a software program to your existing equipment. No need to adapt your sensors or use complex devices.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Factu.epfl.ch%2Fnews%2Fnew-fiber-optic-sensors-transmit-data-up-to-100-ti%2F&amp;t=MWIwZjBmM2QzMTE4ZjQxY2E5NDk5NDU3YzQxMDk0OTJmOWIyNjE1ZSx6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605601499">École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Genetic-optimised aperiodic code for distributed optical fibre sensors”, <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs41467-020-19201-1&amp;t=MGQwNmMyNDlmYTliNjE4ZDU2NGRjYjc4MjM4YzU2YjAzZDlmMDcxZix6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605601499">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19201-1</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/627187404240027648/world-record-internet-speed-record-set-by-ucl-scientists">New world record internet speed set</a></p>
