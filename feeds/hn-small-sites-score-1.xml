<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I was never trained in music beyond some piano lessons as a child,
but I’ve always loved strange and interesting music and sounds.
For the last few months, I’ve been assembling a collection of patch cables
and circuit boards on my desk which, when connected just right,
can create anything from melodic sequences to fast, driving beats to
wacky electronic soundscapes.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>modular synthesizer</strong> in the Eurorack format.
Eurorack is a <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm">de-facto standard</a>
created by German synthesizer manufacturer Doepfer designed around the concept of
voltage control. Everything in Eurorack is controlled through changing voltages,
from -10 to +10 volts, representing everything: audio, pitch, speed, slope,
and even <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/doepfer-a-197-3-rgb-led-controller">color</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/side-shot.jpg" alt="My synthesizer shot from an “aesthetic” angle.">
</figure>

<p>As I learn more about Eurorack and the modular ecosystem, it reminds me more and more
of the magical feeling of working with UNIX tools:
it is a world that exchanges programs for filters, oscillators, and VCAs,
text for voltage, and pipes for patch cables.</p>
<h2 id="text-audio-and-control-voltage">Text, Audio, and Control Voltage</h2>
<p>We’re all used to voltage representing audio.
An “AUX cord”, correctly called a 3.5mm TRS (tip, ring, and sleeve)
stereo cable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
carries two channels of voltage and a common ground between audio devices through
a nearly universal<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> standard.
For audio signals, this voltage jumps between a maximum and minimum voltage.
Its value over time is eventually turned into the movement of a speaker or
headphone diaphragm, which in turn moves the air and can be heard.</p>
<p>In modular synthesis, though, we don’t just use these analog signals to represent the
movements of air that our ears hear as audio.
We also use them to control other parameters: pitch, for example.
Like the text streams that we use to move data around in UNIX tools,
or the JSON payloads that power a huge portion of the modern web,
voltage-based communication is simple but versatile.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/control-voltage.jpg" alt="A module in my synthesizer displaying the changes in control voltage representingpitch"></p>
<p>The micro-Ornament and Crime module displaying changing pitch values,
as represented by the voltage coming into its CV1 input.</p>

</figure>

<p>These voltages are, by their nature, analog -
there are infinitely many values between C4 and D4, or even between C4 and C#4.
Among other things, this means that complex microtonal music is not just possible,
but just as easy for the hardware to produce as music in any Western scale.</p>
<p>Text, of course, isn’t analog, but it does have similar characteristics.
It’s not always easy to parse or generate exactly the right text,
but with enough information, it’s always possible to interoperate with something
that uses a text interface, or even JSON structured data.</p>
<h2 id="oscillators-filters-grep-and-awk">Oscillators, Filters, <code>grep</code>, and <code>awk</code></h2>
<p>The traditional synthesizer, as invented by Bob Moog and co., produces sound
through a so-called <strong>subtractive</strong> process.
Sound, some kind of complex wave-form, is produced by an <strong>oscillator</strong>,
according to control voltage representing pitch.
That waveform, which has lots of harmonics, is put through an amplifier
which turns the sound on when a note is being played, and off when it is not,
and through a filter, which removes some harmonics and emphasizes others.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/threshold.jpg" alt="A Threshold module, outside of the synthesizer."></p>
<p>Just one module, removed from my synthesizer.
This is a four-oscillator retro digital voice, which produces three channels of
square waves and one “complex” waveform (noise, stepped triangle, etc.)</p>
<p>Each voice has four voltage inputs and one output, along with two buttons
and two knobs. The module also provides a “mixed” output.</p>

</figure>

<p>Of course, this is not so different from a standard UNIX log mangling pipeline,
where <code>cat</code> grabs some output from a file, <code>awk</code> formats it in some easy-to-work-with
way, <code>grep</code> cuts out irrelevant information, and <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, or a second <code>awk</code>
invocation formats the output.
This is the versatility of universal, standard interfaces like text, JSON, or voltage;
each tool does what it does, and interoperates cleanly.</p>
<h2 id="envelopes-signal-flow-and-mkfifo">Envelopes, Signal Flow, and <code>mkfifo</code></h2>
<p>In my rack, I have a simple signal flow mapped out by the sequence of modules.
My <a href="https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-sol">Winterbloom Sol</a> turns digital
signals into control voltage.
The <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/kinks/">Kinks</a>,
<a href="https://pushermanproductions.com/product/jakplugg-open-source-pique-4hp-peaks-pcb-fr4-panel/">Pique</a>
and <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">Ornament and Crime</a> modules shape that CV.
Then come two oscillators, a filter, a set of amplifiers, and some effects.</p>
<p>But that’s not necessarily the order I actually patch the signal chain.</p>
<p>Most synths have an “envelope” control, sometimes controlling the level of a signal,
and sometimes controlling a filter.
The magic of modular is that each of those components is discrete.
One module generates control voltage every time a note is played.
Another module (a <strong>voltage controlled amplifier</strong> or VCA) uses that control voltage
to change the volume of the note,
turning a rising voltage into attack and falling voltage into decay.
A third  module (a <strong>voltage controlled filter</strong>) uses that control voltage to change
the harmonic content of the sound. Just by moving a cable from the “FM” input to the
“Q” input, that filter can go from subtracting harmonics to emphasizing them,
or maybe both!</p>
<p>This is the flexibility of modular synthesis.
Every signal exists within a constrained realm, and every module manufacturer
knows what their interface should expect.
Each module does some transformation - in a sense, every module represents
a mathematical funtion, transforming voltage-over-time and knob positions
into voltage-over-time, which can itself be transformed by further modules.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily something we see often in UNIX programming -
but it is possible!
With <code>mkfifo</code>, we can create more complex data flows and unique ways of moving
information around, using multiple FIFOs as input and output files.
In web systems, this kind of many-way connection is very common;
even relatively simple systems like If This Then That allow users to create
long, wide, branching data flows, and even flows that contain cycles.
Ideally, each program or API does work like a mathematical function,
taking command line arguments and input and transforming them into
output and perhaps some side effects, like making a Mastodon post or
writing to disk or a database.</p>
<h2 id="modularity-open-source-and-market-forces">Modularity, Open Source, and Market Forces</h2>
<p>In the forward to  <em>The UNIX Time-Sharing System</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,
the seminal 1978 paper on UNIX, Doug McIlroy articulates the philosophy of modularity
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh.</li>
<li>Expect the output of every program to become the input of another, unknown,
program.</li>
<li>Design and build software […] to be tried early, ideally within weeks. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the same values that motivate the design of the best Eurorack modules.
Each module is easy to experiment with, designed to accomplish one or a few tasks,
explicitly built to integrate with other modules, and well-documented.</p>
<p>Eurorack’s modularity works well because there is no incentive to lock in users -
indeed, there is a significant disincentive, since no one small company
could ever hope to produce a universal product line.
Building modules that work well in as many systems as possible is the best way
to maximize sales.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/front-shot.jpg" alt="A front-on shot of my case, along with my Beatstep Pro controller"></p>
<p>My whole synthesizer is controlled by this Beatstep Pro, and optionally by Linux
software like 100r ORCA.</p>

</figure>

<p>Indeed, even in the cases where larger companies (like Intellijel) have tried to
invent their own standards to get at least some degree of lock-in revenue,
the size of the market limits the effectiveness of that strategy.
Their smaller, 1U form factor has been widely adopted, and there are now nearly
a dozen small manufacturers making compatible modules.</p>
<p>We, as software engineers, should strive to build software that is amenable to
interoperability, because that is the most effective way to support creativity.
Documented, open, and capable APIs are good, if your software must be centralized;
federation through open protocols is even better.</p>
<p>Critically, your interface does not need to be optimal.
Control voltage in 1v/Oct certainly isn’t; it requires difficult and imprecise
exponential conversion circuits, or slow and expensive floating point computations.
Consider, for instance, ActivityPub and the Mastodon ecosystem.
Eugen Rochko could have easily stuck with OStatus, which does have some advantages,
but the Mastodon project’s move to ActivityPub catalzyed an entire ecosystem,
with dozens of other microblogging products, as well as blogs, video sharing,
music sharing, and photo sharing software springing up, all able to interoperate
at least somewhat.</p>
<p>Modularity also promotes longevity.
The predecessor to <code>ls</code> was written in 1961<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>; the GNU <code>find</code> command has
history as far back as 1987<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. These programs are so deeply embedded in the brain
stem of computing that building a modern server operating system without something
compatible is nearly unthinkable.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/open-source.jpg" alt="Another side shot of my synthesizer."></p>
<p>Every module in this photograph is open source - software and hardware.</p>

</figure>

<p>I should also point out that, while free and open source software is,
in my opinion, a moral good,
software freedom and open protocols/interfaces are tangential concerns.
While many Eurorack modules are open source, some of the most popular are not;
for example, Make Noise’s analog computer Maths is not an open source design,
but it is the heart of many modular systems because it integrates well into
the ecosystem and has a clearly documented and well-specified interface.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Simple Storage Service, for instance, is a proprietary service with an open
protocol, and it is hugely successful - so much so that many projects have sprung up
to implement its interface, and a huge volume of cloud software is designed to work
with “S3 - and other stuff that works the same.”</p>
<p>Modularity is the most direct path to innovation. As software engineers,
we should do our absolute best, both technically and politically, to build
programs that do one thing well,
programs that can be tried early,
and programs that work well together.
Anything else guarantees stagnation, lock-in, frustration, and eventual obscurity.</p>

                    <p>Back in the old days when information was scarce and limited, it made sense to blame all project management challenges on people management skills.</p><p>Here are 5 common challenges you might have come across across multiple articles:</p><ul><li>Not having a clear goal</li><li>Having unrealistic deadlines and expectations</li><li>Not creating accountability</li><li>Miscommunication</li><li>Lack of engagement with stakeholders</li></ul><p>However, a lot of teams are able to get past these challenges today thanks to the internet.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>A buyer report from <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/project-management/">Software Advice</a> says <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/it-project-management-buyer-trends-2016/">56% of the project managers</a> are looking to switch their project management tool every year!</p><p>If you want to deliver exceptional software for your customers, watch out for these 5 challenges with project management tools that lead to subpar software being shipped.</p><p>In conversations we’re having with software companies, one word that surfaces often is “pain”.</p><p>The pain of aligning everyone on a common goal. The pain of not being able to collaborate cross functionally because the tool is too rigid and you’ll have to setup multiple configurations. The pain of getting teams to learn new terminologies. The pain of not being able to make sense of all the changes your team makes and how it all affects the macro-level picture.</p><p>They are clearly in a lot of pain. And the solution to it isn’t about assigning tasks and setting due dates. Let me explain why by expanding each of these challenges.</p><h3 id="1-aligning-everyone-on-a-common-big-picture-goal"><strong>1. Aligning everyone on a common, big picture goal</strong></h3><p>A lot of teams use a project management tool that makes them fill out a form which keeps those user stories and tickets in isolation.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Having your user stories and tasks sit in isolation makes it exponentially harder to make your team care about what they’re building or understand why they’re building it. It only incentivizes your team to complete things faster.</p><h3 id="2-learning-new-terminologies"><strong>2. Learning new terminologies</strong></h3><p>Let’s be honest…</p><p>The first time you tried to learn agile and its methodologies you scratched your hair wondering what on earth an epic meant. Or what the difference between Scrum and Agile was. </p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/what-is-an-epic.gif" alt="The unspoken project management challenge - how most teams are when learning agile terminologies"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While the methodology might work, <mark><strong>it’s incredibly hard for someone new to get a grip of what each of those terminologies even mean.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>What if if your team could become agile without having to spend time learning the terminologies or the tool? Wouldn't that be great?</p><h3 id="3-unable-to-collaborate-cross-functionally"><strong>3. Unable to collaborate cross-functionally</strong></h3><p>It isn’t enough to just ship new features today. You need to make sure the design is pixel perfect, the user flow is smooth without any friction, the software is bug-free. And the list goes on.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>That means, when working with members from other teams, you need to what they’re working on and know their progress too! <mark><strong>But when your tool is built purposefully only for development without taking into consideration the other teams who are involved in the process, how do you collaborate with them?</strong></mark></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Surely you can’t be switching between multiple tools for each team! And of course, nobody wants to set up more configurations in an already cluttered tool and see a dip in your development team’s productivity!</p><h3 id="4-inefficiencies-in-tracking-progress-in-multiple-teams-as-you-grow"><strong>4.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>This guide describes how to tune your AMD64/x86_64 hardware and Linux system for
running real-time or low latency workloads. Example workloads where this type of
tuning would be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line rate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer">packet capture</a></li>
<li>Line rate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">deep packet inspection (DPI)</a></li>
<li>Applications using kernel-bypass networking</li>
<li>Accurate benchmarking of
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/868568/what-do-the-terms-cpu-bound-and-i-o-bound-mean">CPU bound</a>
programs</li>
</ul>
<p>The term latency in this context refers to the time between receiving some event
and the time when the event was processed. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time between a network packet was received by a NIC until an application
finished processing the packet.</li>
<li>The time between a request was submitted to a queue and the worker thread
finished processing the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve low latency this guide describes how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize per core performance by maximizing CPU frequency and disabling
power saving features.</li>
<li>Minimize jitter caused by interrupts, timers and other applications
interfering with your workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can measure the reduced system jitter using my tool
<a href="https://github.com/rigtorp/hiccups">hiccups</a>. In this example it shows how core
3 was isolated and experienced a maximum jitter of 18 us:</p>
<pre><code>$ hiccups | column -t -R 1,2,3,4,5,6

turn it off if you want to reduce jitter introduced by contention on processor
resources.</p>
<p>HT/SMT can be turned off in your system’s UEFI or BIOS firmware settings.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost">Intel Turbo Boost</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Turbo_Core">AMD Turbo Core</a> technologies
allows the processor to automatically overclock itself as long as it stays
within some power and thermal envelope. If you have good cooling (set fan speed
to max in BIOS), disable unused cores in BIOS or using the CPU hotplug
functionality it’s possible to run your application cores continuously at the
higher boost frequency.</p>
<p>Check if turbo boost is enabled:</p>
<pre><code>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
</code></pre><p>Output should be 0 if turbo boost is enabled.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use <code>cpupower</code> to check the status of turbo boost:</p>
<pre><code>cpupower frequency-info
</code></pre><p>Use the <code>turbostat</code> tool to verify the clock frequency of each core. Note that
<code>turbostat</code> will cause scheduling jitter and should not be used during
production.</p>

<h3 id="isolate-cores">Isolate cores</h3>
<p>By default the kernel scheduler will load balance all threads across all
available cores. To stop system threads from interfering with your application
threads from you can use the kernel command line option <code>isolcpus</code>. It disables
scheduler load balancing for the isolated cores and causes threads to be
restricted to the non-isolated cores by default. Note that your critical
application threads needs to be specifically pinned to the isolated cores in
order to run there.</p>
<p>For example to isolate cores 1 through 7 add <code>isolcpus=1-7</code> to your kernel
command line.</p>
<p>When using isolcpus the kernel will still create several kernel threads on the
isolated cores. Some of these kernel threads can be moved to the non-isolated
cores.</p>
<p>Try to move all kernel threads to core 0:</p>
<pre><code># pgrep -P 2 | xargs -i taskset -p -c 0 {}
</code></pre><p>Alternatively use <code>tuna</code> move all kernel threads away from cores 1-7:</p>
<pre><code># tuna --cpus=1-7 --isolate
</code></pre><p>Verify by using the <code>tuna</code> command to show CPU affinities for all threads:</p>
<pre><code>tuna -P
</code></pre><p>Additionally kernel workqueues needs to be moved away from isolated cores. To
move all work queues to core 0 (cpumask 0x1):</p>
<pre><code># find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask  -exec sh -c 'echo 1 &gt; {}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Verify by listing current workqueue affinities:</p>
<pre><code>find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify if cores were successfully isolated by checking how many thread
context switches are occurring per core:</p>
<pre><code># perf stat -e 'sched:sched_switch' -a -A --timeout 10000
</code></pre><p>The isolated cores should show a very low context switch count.</p>
<p>There is a work in progress patch set to improve task isolation even further,
see
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/816298/">A full task-isolation mode for the kernel</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-timer-tick-interrupts">Reducing timer tick interrupts</h3>
<p>The scheduler runs regularly on each core in order to switch between runnable
threads. This will introduce jitter for latency critical applications. If you
have isolated your application cores and are running a single application thread
per isolated core you can use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html?highlight=nohz_full"><code>nohz_full</code></a> kernel command line option
in order to suppress the timer interrupts.</p>
<p>For example to enable <code>nohz_full</code> on cores 1-7 add <code>nohz_full=1-7 rcu_nocbs=1-7</code>
to your kernel command line.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the timer tick is only disabled on a core when there
is only a single runnable thread scheduled on that core. You can see the number
of runnable threads per core in <em>/proc/sched_debug</em>.</p>
<p>The virtual memory subsystem runs a per core statistics update task every 1
second by default. You can reduce this interval by setting <code>vm.stat_interval</code> to
a higher value, for example 120 seconds:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># sysctl vm.stat_interval=120
</code></pre><p>Finally you can verify that the timer interrupt frequency is reduced by
inspecting <em>/proc/interrupts</em> or using <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><em>perf</em></a> to monitor timer
interrupts:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'irq_vectors:local_timer_entry' -a -A --timeout 30000

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

CPU0                   31,204      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU1                    3,771      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU2                        3      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU3                        4      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry

      30.001671482 seconds time elapsed
</code></pre><p>In the above example cores 2 and 3 has a reduced timer interrupt frequency.
Expect <code>isolcpus</code> + <code>nohz_full</code> cores to show a timer interrupt every other
second or so. Unfortunately the timer tick cannot be completely eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="interrupt-affinity">Interrupt affinity</h3>
<p>Reduce jitter from interrupt processing by changing the CPU affinity of the
interrupts. This can easily be done by running
<a href="https://github.com/Irqbalance/irqbalance"><em>irqbalance</em></a>. By default
<em>irqbalance</em> will automatically isolate the cores specified by the kernel
command line parameter <code>isolcpus</code>. You can also specify cores to isolate using
the <code>IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>To isolate cores specified in <code>isolcpus</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>To isolate core 3 (hexadecimal bitmask 0x8):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=8 irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>List CPU affinity for all IRQs:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /proc/irq/ -name smp_affinity_list -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify that isolated cores are not receiving interrupts by monitoring
<em>/proc/interrupts</em>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">watch cat /proc/interrupts

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="div_block-37-17"><p><span id="span-39-17"> <p>"I do not know Trump or Bolsonaro," <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://covexit.com/shock-testimony-of-professor-raoult-at-french-national-assembly/" target="_blank">said</a> Didier Raoult, a professor of infectious diseases at the IHU-Marseille, on 24 June, the French National Assembly, when provided a testimonial for a special commission.</p> <p>There I saw that the teacher has already started to understand the hole that got involved and who were responsible for creating the first wave that fucked him.</p> <p>This wave, after all, placed him, by chance, as an important piece at the center of the chessboard of the most ferocious geopolitical dispute since the end of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>In addition to the denial of knowing Trump or Bolsonaro, which is quite fun, where Raoult tried to distance himself from these two demented leaders, the infectologist reported serious things: he suffered <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://covexit.com/shock-testimony-of-professor-raoult-at-french-national-assembly/" target="_blank">death threats</a> soon after proposing the treatment of COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, two cheap and generic drugs.</p> <p>The doctor behind the threats was found. It’s from a university hospital in Nantes. Incidentally, he was the person who <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://covexit.com/shock-testimony-of-professor-raoult-at-french-national-assembly/" target="_blank">received the</a> most money from Gilead, a large pharmaceutical company, in the past 6 years.</p> <p>Here I propose to put together, piece by piece, the puzzle of what I consider the biggest farce in modern history. I don’t worry about producing a short text. It will have analyzes, including new ones, and from different points of view.</p> <p>It involves science, healing, politics, geopolitics, mass and group psychology. With the scenario set, it is not difficult to predict good and bad things that will happen in the coming months and years.</p> <p>Throughout the text, the reader will understand the most important thing: the circumstance of how this false narrative was put together. The reader will also be prompted, by itself, to conclude whether the treatment proposed by Didier Raout works or not.</p> <p>And you will also understand how the majority of the North American scientific class, from Latin America and Europe, regions of the globe under strong influence from the USA, were directed to an incredibly gross error.</p> <p>In addition to the facts and figures, which are accompanied by external links, all I write are my own opinions, based on the facts, in first person, from my point of view, of how I see the world going completely insane in front of me.</p> <p>I am not afraid to sign my name when publishing it, even though I know that the almost unanimity of Brazilian scientists are against the application of these drugs and repeat that “there is no scientific evidence” of the functioning.</p> <p>And one thing I’m sure will attract attention. The fact that I have to give examples with incredibly basic logic, as if I were talking to children, to explain the facts. It is necessary. The farce has gone so far that I need many examples and analogies to bring reason back.</p> <p>Signed, I make it available to cover me, today or in the future, if my analyzes prove to be incorrect, after all, it is not a simple or light claim.</p> <h2>In February there is carnival</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA.jpeg" alt="china and europe" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA.jpeg 1000w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure> <p>From China and Europe came reports of large numbers of dead people and entire cities blocked, with people in confinement, preventing the transmission of the coronavirus.</p> <p>On the top street of my house, in Atibaia, in the interior of São Paulo, 60 km from the state capital, the carnival took place.</p> <p>For four days, loud music came through my window. I didn’t go to the party, which I do every year. The word agglomeration already bothered me.</p> <p>It was the end of February, just before the WHO — World Health Organization, declared that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brasil.elpais.com/sociedade/2020-03-11/oms-declara-que-coronavirus-e-uma-pandemia-global.html" target="_blank">we were in a global pandemic</a> of apocalyptic proportions.</p> <p>I preferred to go ahead and follow the guidance of scientists before government decisions. I was the first in the city to join voluntary confinement.</p> <p>A few days later I still went to a bar. I thought the risk was low. In airy environments, the risk is less. It was the last time I went to one. It was an open bar, something normal in our tropical climate, where half the people are on the street and the other half inside the establishment.</p> <p>It was the farewell of a musician friend. Samba and jazz were in the repertoire. He was already hired to go to Australia, where he would board a tourist ship. It would be one of the attractions. He was excited. I didn’t want to discourage him, but it was strange that the company was still confident, until that day, that new trips would come out, even with the Diamond Princess <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemia_de_COVID-19_no_navio_Diamond_Princess" target="_blank">case</a>, off the coast of Japan.</p> <p>I no longer held hands to greet anyone. I ran away from close contacts, always stayed outside, and washed my hands constantly. They laughed and found it strange. Some called me paranoid.</p> <p>I soon made a bad prediction: that all bars would be empty and closed in a short space of time. I decided not to leave anymore. I didn’t want to be bothered by crowds. I didn’t want to be a joke either. Our state and municipal governments had not yet taken action against the virus.</p> <p>At home, it remained to read, to follow the news and scientific publications that began to appear frequently. I have a habit, healthy or not, of going deeper into research, and reading studies, when I’m interested in a subject. I don’t like to just wait and see, one or the other news, superficially, in the mass media.</p> <p>The craze for going to medical research sites to read papers came from a few years earlier. In 2016 I broke a bone in an accident. Practically three months lying, with little mobility, without drinking, and with an IPAD in my hand, I read all the studies on my recovery, to the point that, in a chat, shortly afterwards, with an orthopedist professor at an important medical school, he says he has never seen a patient know so much about his problem. “This one studied more than my students”, he joked with a friend.</p> <h2>Piece 1: the hydroxychloroquine solution appears</h2> <p>March 17, 2020</p> <p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hydroxychloroquine_final_DOI_IJAA.pdf" target="_blank">The study ran the internet.</a> He had this impressive chart.

<p>What this function does is to give you a <em>lumninance-correct</em> grayscale version of any matplotlib colormap.
I've found this useful for quickly checking how my plots might appear if printed in black and white, but I think it's probably even more useful for stoking the flame of the internet's general rant against <em>jet</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<p>If you want to take a step toward joining the in-crowd of chromatically-sensitive data viz geeks, your best bet is to start by bashing <em>jet</em>. Even if you don't know it by name, I can guarantee that if you've read many scientific papers, you've seen jet before. For example, here's a snapshot of a plot from neuroscience journal which is skewered by an <a href="https://abandonmatlab.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/lets-talk-colormaps/">appropriately ranty blogpost</a> on the subject:</p>
<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.io/figures/jet.png"></p>
<p>Jet is the default colorbar originally used by matlab, and this default was inherited in the early days of Python's <code>matplotlib</code> package. The reasons not to use jet are numerous, and you can find good arguments against it across the web. For some more subdued and nuanced arguments, I'd start with the paper <a href="http://www.jwave.vt.edu/~rkriz/Projects/create_color_table/color_07.pdf">Rainbow Color Map (Still) Considered Harmful</a> and, for more general visualization tips, <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1003833">Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures</a>.</p>
<p>So what do I have to add to this discussion that hasn't been already said? Well, nothing really, except the code snippet I shared above. Let me show you what it does.</p>

<h2 id="Taking-the-Color-Out-of-Jet">Taking the Color Out of Jet<a href="#Taking-the-Color-Out-of-Jet">¶</a></h2><p>Let's start by defining some data and seeing how it looks with the default <code>jet</code> colormap:</p>

<p>We'll use matplotlib's <code>imshow</code> command to visualize this.
By default, it will use the <code>"jet"</code> colormap:</p>

<p>At first glance this might look OK. But upon closer examination, you might notice that jet's <em>Luminance profile</em> is incredibly complicated.
Because your eye has different levels of sensitivity to light of different color, the luminance is not simply the sum of the RGB values as you might naively expect, but some weighted Euclidean sum of the individual values. You can find more information than you'd ever need to know on <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color_mods/#grayscale">imagemagick's website</a>.</p>

<p>It's a mess! The greyscale-only version of this colormap has strange luminance spikes in the middle, and makes it incredibly difficult to figure out what's going on in a plot with a modicum of complexity. Much better is to use a colormap with a uniform luminance gradient, such as the built-in grayscale colormap. Let's plot this beside the previous two:</p>

<p>There are some colormaps in here that have very nice, linear luminance gradients, and this is something you should keep in mind when choosing your color map.</p>
<p>Much more could be written about choosing an appropriate color map for any given data; for a more in-depth discussion of matplotlib's maps (and some interesting luminance illustrations), you can refer to matplotlib's <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html">choosing a colormap</a> documentation.</p>
<p>If you're interested in streamlined statistical plotting in Python with well thought-out default color choices, I'd suggest taking a look at Michael Waskom's <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/">seaborn</a> project, and especially the associated <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/color_palettes.html">Color Palette Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you find this <code>grayify_cmap</code> snippet helpful, and thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Attention is scarce. And attention is valuable.</p>

<p>Attention is scarce because there is limited time in the day but an unlimited number of things to potentially care about. As an example, consider YouTube. How much of YouTube’s videos do you think you’d get through if you devoted the rest of your life to watching them? Ready for the answer? It turns out you’d die of old age before getting through a single day of uploads.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> In the same way that it’s impossible to pay attention to anything more than a tiny slice of YouTube, it’s impossible to pay attention to anything more than a tiny slice of reality. As a result, we only ever pay attention to a few things. This is why attention is necessarily scarce.</p>

<p>By itself, the scarcity of attention does not give it value. For example, toxic nuclear waste is scarce, but it is not valuable.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The reason attention is valuable is that it’s almost always a prerequisite for impact. A researcher whose papers get no attention will not lead others to new discoveries. A founder whose startup gets no attention will find no investors and no customers. A journalist whose articles get no attention will inform and entertain no one. Ultimately, it’s difficult to impact people without first earning their attention.</p>

<p>Earning attention is easy if you’ve already had large impact. This is one reason why success begets success. But before your success, how can you get attention?</p>

<p>Here is a simple strategy. Are you researching nuclear fusion? Then talk about the Moore’s law of fusion! Are you founding a battery startup? Talk about the Moore’s law of batteries! Are you writing an article about how paint dries? Talk about the Moore’s law of drying paint!</p>

<p>Comparing your work to Moore’s law is an instant recipe for getting your audience to imagine how you’ll spawn entire industries and transform the world. And the best part about exponential growth is that it starts small. If anyone ever questions whether your work is truly world-changing, you can rebut that while your first steps are admittedly small on an absolute scale, that is how all exponential curves start. Only after growing exponentially for decades will they then become huge.</p>

<p>Riding coattails is a time-tested strategy, and in the world of technology, there are no coattails bigger than those of Moore’s law. So it is hardly a surprise to see more and more people coining their progress as the “Moore’s law of <strong>__</strong>.” In the past few years, I have heard people reference the Moore’s law of solar power, the Moore’s law of mass spectroscopy, and the Moore’s law of aircraft, to name just a few.</p>

<p>Seeing this explosion of references to Moore’s law got me thinking along the same lines as Gordon Moore 50 years ago. How fast are these pseudo-Moore’s laws being invented? Are they following any sort of regular trend that would allow us to cautiously extrapolate? And is this merely a short-term fad or the beginning of a tectonic shift in technological marketing?</p>

<p>To answer these questions, I scoured the web for every reference I could find to the “Moore’s law of <strong>__</strong>” and then traced each back to its earliest mention. In doing so (and with surprisingly little researcher bias) I made a stunning discovery:</p>

<p>There is a Moore’s law of Moore’s laws.</p>

<p>For the past four decades, the number of Moore’s laws coined has been doubling every five years. Early Moore’s laws were technical in nature (e.g., the Moore’s law of software or the Moore’s law of bandwidth), but as time passed, Moore’s laws were invented for topics far afield of computers (e.g., the Moore’s law of corn or the Moore’s law for NFL field goals).</p>

<p>Let’s extrapolate this forward. If the number of Moore’s laws continues to double every five years, then by the year 2080, there will exist a Moore’s law for every single word in the English language.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> We may have a Moore’s law of zebras, a Moore’s law of love, and perhaps even a Moore’s law of absquatulating.</p>

<p>So if you want to use this technique to harness your audience’s scarce and valuable attention, do it soon, before this land grab ends and the entire English dictionary has been claimed.</p>

<p>That’s what I’ve done just now, with the Moore’s Law of Moore’s Laws.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Protocol Buffer, also known as Protobuf, is Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. It has been widely used in many applications, such as TensorFlow and <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>. We have actually been using it without being aware, thus it has become a black box to most of the users.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to give a short tutorial on how to use Protocol Buffer in C++.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>Protobuf compiler and libraries could be installed via <code>apt</code> on Ubuntu. However, to use the latest version of protobuf, we install from source code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd</span> /tmp
<span>$ </span>wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.8.0/protobuf-all-3.8.0.tar.gz
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-xf</span> protobuf-all-3.8.0.tar.gz
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>protobuf-3.8.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I chose to install the <code>all</code> version so it would be a little bit slow. To accelerate the installation process., we take advantage of multi-threads.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./configure
<span>$ </span>make <span>-j16</span>
<span>$ </span>make check <span>-j16</span> <span># Make sure the installation would not have problems</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>make <span>install</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>ldconfig <span># Refresh shared library cache.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Protocol Buffer libraries would be installed to <code>/usr/local/lib</code> by default.</p>



<p>To verify protobuf has been installed successfully.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>protoc <span>--version</span>
libprotoc 3.8.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3>

<p>To learn Protocol Buffer, the most intuitive way is to go to the Google Protocol Buffer official website and start its official tutorial. However, the official <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/cpptutorial">tutorials</a> on the Google protobuf website are still using programming standard Proto2 while the latest programming standard is Proto3 which was released in 2016. The official <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/examples">samples</a> are using Proto3 and CMake, however, its CMake is not standard and many of its macros were not documented on the official CMake website. Therefore, I re-implemented Google’s official Protobuf C++ example using Proto3 and CMake with the best practice in a way that users are most likely to run into.</p>



<p>The source code could be found on my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/leimao/Protocol_Buffer_Examples">Protocol Buffer Examples</a>.</p>



<p>The protobuf <code>proto</code> file, C++ <code>cc</code> file, and CMake <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files should be self-explanatory since I have put a lot of comments in the code to make it human-readable and easy to understand.</p>

<h3 id="basic-protocol">Basic Protocol</h3>

<p>To summarize the basic protocol of programming using protobuf:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define the structure of the data in a <code>proto</code> file.</li>
  <li>Implement the C++ programs which serialize/de-serialize the structured data. The programs will use the header and source code files of the structured data generated by the protobuf compiler. Alternatively, the program will use the header file generated by the protobuf compiler and the static library of the structured data generated by the C++ compiler.</li>
  <li>Write CMake compile system to generate the header and source code files of the structured data, static library of the structured data, and the executable files.</li>
</ol>

A big target, but we were confident–as we had the two core ingredients to growth:</p><ol><li>A clear product pitch:"yet another habit app... but free AND with group functionality" </li><li>Growth expertise<sup>1</sup> (endnote noted)</li></ol><p>But after 4 months of burning the midnight oil, we missed our target of 1000 daily users...<strong> by &gt; 5X</strong>.</p><p>Some users do use &amp; promote the app because it's free and has "cool group linking". And our App Store rating is a 4.8, with over 130 combined ratings. But altogether that love amounts to ...<strong> ~5 new user signups/daily</strong>... and &lt; 200 people using (if you are one of them, we really do appreciate it!).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Famous growth successes (AirBnB + Craigslist, Dropbox referrals) are well documented, but the stories of the failed experiments along the way are not. Here's a short list we've tried of things <strong>that have not driven any meaningful growth:</strong></p><ul><li>Launching our users' most requested feature </li><li>"Successful" Product Hunt launch (240 upvotes)</li><li>Making the UI ~2X better</li><li>.. and fixing many broken buttons</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whatuserswanted">What users wanted...</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As any diligent PM would, I reached out to our users for interviews (note: if getting users to interview is <a href="https://snaphabit.app/blog/3-steps-to-product-decisions/#user-feedback">hard</a>, maybe that's a bad sign). Across 15 interviews, the problem most consistently mentioned was the inability to set weekly goals eg. &nbsp;"Work out 4X per week". Other habit apps had the feature, and it aligned with our intuition. So we built it 🎉.</p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/08/IMG_BE540AC0130B-1-1.png"><figcaption>Ah, problem solved. Success is imminent!</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-results-">The results...</h2><ul><li>Practically no one uses it. Less than 4% of habits created use our "most requested feature"</li><li>Retention did not change, and in fact, got worse, after launching this</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>So in summary, we asked a set of users about their biggest problems — built an MVP of that feature — and <strong>saw no usage change according to any meaningful metric.</strong></p><h2 id="why-did-it-have-no-impact">Why did it have no impact?</h2><p>Even if our users "wanted" the per week feature... I don't believe that was stopping them from evangelizing the product. &nbsp;<strong>Like all things, I suspect it just goes back to the fact we are not <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">solving a real user problem</a>. &nbsp; </strong>At the core, habits are hard to build. There are <em>a lot</em> of habit apps in the app store... and for most people, habit tracking + doing habits with friends is not a natural behavior.</p><p>There are some people we are solving a problem for (we have a few families and friend groups who use religiously), but<strong> </strong>we don't how many of these people even exist, and how to best reach them.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whatsnexttwopaths">What's next? Two paths...</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><ol><li>Solve a more immediate problem for people</li><li>Learn more about the users we are solving a problem for, and develop a scalable growth strategy to target them.</li></ol><p>For 1, we are actively running experiments. We are partnering with creators to add "challenges" with content to the product. &nbsp;This solves two different user problems - <strong>I want to do X</strong> ("I want to improve my back", "I want to learn about social justice") as well as<strong> I want to engage with this creator. </strong>Second, we are testing public habits, to see if people want random accountability buddies (I'm very skeptical). For 2, we are interviewing existing users to inform specific strategies.</p><p>It is too easy to go heads-down and convince yourself that simply one more feature will change the outcome. To mitigate that, we should have had regular check-ins to step back and question our core hypothesis. The fact that our first 20 users only added .5 friends should have raised a red flag that we had not found a real problem–or at least a set of users that had that problem. Wish us luck as we keep exploring, and let me know if you have any questions (<a href="https://snaphabit.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="2a404b414f6a59444b5a424b48435e044b5a5a">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>).</p><hr><p><em>You can download the app on iOS <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snaphabit-ai-healthy-habits/id1494552185" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.gravitech.habit.staging" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em></p><p><sup>1</sup> &nbsp;I thought I understood how growth worked as a former growth PM at a large tech co. <strong>False.</strong> Growth at "large tech co" is very different from growth at small consumer startup.</p>

</div><div><p>If you have a program that wants to do something periodically, say
once every ten seconds, the obvious and simplest way is to just
sleep for ten seconds after each time you do the thing. For example:</p>

  publish_device_stats()
  time.sleep(10)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Some languages and libraries also offer an API that I've seen called
a 'ticker'; Go, for example, has <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Ticker"><code>time.Ticker</code></a>. A ticker signals or invokes
you somehow every time interval, such as every ten seconds. With
a ticker, you could write the above (in Go) as something like:</p>

<blockquote><pre>ticker := time.NewTicker(10*time.Second)
for {
  t := &lt;- ticker.C
  collect_device_stats(t)
  publish_device_stats(t)
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The big difference between the two is that <strong>a ticker is indifferent
to how long it took you to do your work</strong>. If collecting and
publishing device stats takes two seconds, the sleep approach means
that you will do this once every twelve seconds (two seconds for
the work followed by ten seconds of sleeping). The ticker approach
will collect and publish once every ten seconds, because it signals
you every ten seconds even if it took you two seconds to collect
and publish device stats.</p>

<p>While this may make tickers sound great, this behavior has potential
downsides. Which one you want depends partly on what your reasons are
for sleeping or delaying. In particular, if you're sleeping to limit
the load your actions create, then a ticker may not be what you want,
precisely because it's indifferent to how long your work took. If your
work takes nine seconds and you sleep afterward for ten, you're keeping
things less than 50% busy. If your work takes nine seconds and you have
a ten second ticker, you're keeping things 90% busy; one second after
you finish your work the ticker will go off again and start it all over.</p>

<p>Tickers are great for things you want to happen every N seconds,
even if they take a bunch of time (or a variable amount of time).
Sleeping is great for things you want to happen no more often than
once every N seconds. However, the difference between the two only
matters if what you're doing does (or may) take an appreciable
amount of time compared to the tick (or sleep) interval; if it isn't
going to, you might as well use whichever API is more idiomatic and
convenient, although tickers will probably make things more regular
and precise.</p>

<p>(This set of thoughts was sparked by poking around in <a href="https://gitlab.com/shouptech/cyberpower_exporter">some Python
code</a> that used
the <code>sleep()</code> idiom and then thinking about how it would probably
use a ticker in Go. (Well, in Go it would have a better API for what
it's doing, but apart from that.))</p>

<p>I wish I could yell at each a**hole that isn’t <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">wearing a mask</a> around me. The burden gets even bigger for small business owners, teachers, office workers, bus drivers, and so on.</p>



<p>Then I saw this in an NYT newsletter:&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="435" srcset="http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383.jpg 828w, http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383-270x300.jpg 270w, http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383-768x854.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px"></figure></div>



<p>Yeesh. So I thought… when else in history has humanity had issues adopting a simple, low-effort habit to save lives?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Seat belts!</strong></p>



<p>And you know what worked better to increase seat belt usage than any education or law enforcement?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Annoying, automated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iee-sensing.com/en/blog/details/2019/09/the-seat-belt-reminder-what-s-that-noise-all-about">ding ding ding</a>&nbsp;sounds in cars.</strong></p>



<p>Introducing the <a href="https://wear-a-mask.glitch.me/">😷📸🤖FaceMaskScolder3000</a>! <em>Let the machine do the scolding for you.</em></p>



<p><strong>How to use:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://wear-a-mask.glitch.me/">Load the site</a>&nbsp;on a laptop or tablet* and point the webcam at the entrance to your space. The alarm will go off whenever someone walks in without a mask fully covering their mouth and nose.</p>



<p><em>You may optionally add your own&nbsp;judgmental stare.</em></p>



<p>There’s plenty of companies that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250357/france-masks-public-transport-mandatory-ai-surveillance-camera-software">provide this</a>&nbsp;commercially. This is the weekend-warrior open-source version that can run on any device with a browser and a webcam.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>[Ok, maker hat off, pragmatic hat on]</em>&nbsp;Now the real bottlenecks here include: awareness, cost, distribution,&nbsp;implementation, maintenance, support, etc. This hack was the easy/sexy part.&nbsp;<strong>If you’ve read this far, perhaps you see a way to solve those challenges in your local neighborhood.</strong></p>



<p><strong>☝️☝️ I’d love to be in touch about this.&nbsp;☝️☝️</strong></p>



<p>*Most people don’t have an extra laptop/tablet laying around. (And if you do, you should donate it to families who could really use it for remote learning.)&nbsp;A friend suggested making a raspberry pi version to bring down costs… open to more cost reducing ideas!</p>



<hr>



<p><em>Nerdy details:</em></p>



<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://wear-a-mask.glitch.me/">face detection web app</a>&nbsp;runs&nbsp;<strong>entirely on the frontend</strong>, and does not store any videos or images, neither on your device nor on any servers.</p>

<p>I originally forked off of a tutorial by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_Dj_gVXao4" target="_blank">CodeSTACKr</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/codeSTACKr/Face-Detection" target="_blank">(Github)</a>&nbsp;which makes use of the incredible&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/" target="_blank">face-api.js</a>. Special thanks to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/britishdan" target="_blank">Dan Coldham</a>&nbsp;for the elegant solution to a big false positives issue. I also found a&nbsp;<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-built-a-face-mask-detector-for-covid-19-using-pytorch-lightning-67eb3752fd61">way more data-sciency how-to</a>&nbsp;using pytorch.</p>



<p>Learn about the wonders of masks from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/health/coronavirus-hair-salon-masks.html">NYTimes</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent?fbclid=IwAR3qhv694T59BgD9GaW7fdzVC5anYS0vfh2ztRA1CtpAD4Hc-VfHWUZKgpo">UCSF</a>.</p>



<p>The app, code, etc. are all free to use non-commercially (I mean, like a business can use it but not sell it, you get the spirit – maybe this isn’t the right license? Would love advice.)</p>

<p>After I published my post pointing out the <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/06/diversity-and-big-tech-media/?swcfpc=1">hypocrisy of Big Tech Media in the diversity in tech debate</a>, I got a few grunts of acknowledgement from a couple of the publications covered. Afterwards, these journalists sat on what was surely a newsworthy story. Why? I don’t know.</p>



<p><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/15/big-tech-media-colluding/">Outside of journalists banding together in silence</a>, the post was well-received, but deep inside, I sensed people wanted a data size larger than just five Big Tech Media publications which I had used. So here is a more comprehensive data bank of 982 individuals across 14 publications. It’s a collaboration between myself and<a href="https://twitter.com/balajis"> Balaji</a>. It includes an estimated race and gender breakdown of those that determine what we read about tech, along with the code snippets used in collating the data as well as the raw data itself.</p>



<p><a href="https://tech-journalism-diversity-report.github.io/code/">Read the study, it includes code samples.</a></p>



<p>Since Big Tech Media hasn’t published an official diversity report of their organizations, the study was done using publicly available information on Twitter and cross-checked with Twitter lists of tech journalists. It uses a few different methods for data collection, and a few different methods to determine race and gender, and gets similar results each time. The data set is open source, so if there are any errors please submit a correction. <strong>However, the best bet would be for each tech media corporation to follow the lead of tech companies and release a public diversity report.</strong></p>



<p>Highlight of the results:</p>



<ul><li>Big Tech Media is ~ 80% White</li><li>Big Tech is ~51% White </li></ul>



<p>Again, you should take a moment and read it: <a href="https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com/">https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com</a>.</p>







<p><strong>Big Tech Media corporations should do the right thing and release the demographic breakdown of their employee base. There is even a federal requirement to file the </strong><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo-1-survey"><strong>form EEO-1 Survey</strong></a><strong> which breaks this data down.</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Acknowledgements.</em></strong><em> I’ve been writing on this topic for </em><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2010/04/05/black-founders/?swcfpc=1"><em>ten years</em></a><em>, and wrote about it </em><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/06/diversity-and-big-tech-media/"><em>again</em></a><em> in early July on my own accord.

August 1, 2020 | https://eek.ro/why-bpg-will-replace-gifs-and-not-only/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://eek.ro/why-bpg-will-replace-gifs-and-not-only/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Let’s start with some history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BPG (Better Portable Graphics) is a new image format with the purpose to replace JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>By Fabrice Bellard</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that BPG not only is way smaller than JPEG but also delivers a better quality. And that’s not all! It also supports animations!</p>
<p>And when I say animation, I actually say GIF-like movies with MP4 quality that are actually smaller than the mp4 it was built from.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example (I have not included a GIF example because the same quality size and frame rate means that the GIF will have exactly 33.8MB)</p>
<p>So let’s go:</p>
<p>
<video id="ambition-mp4" loop="">
<source src="https://eek.ro/assets/bpg/preview-ambition-no-audio.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>mp4, 25fps, 927kb
</p>

<p>
<img id="ambition-bpg" alt="Ambition BPG" src="https://eek.ro/assets/bpg/ambition.bpg">
<br>bpg, 25fps, 518kb
</p>


<p>The movie is called <a href="https://fnd.ie/vid/BJ3B">Ambition</a> and you can view it on <a href="https://fnd.ie/vid/BJ3B">Findie</a>.</p>
<h3 id="spot-the-differences-">Spot the differences? :)</h3>
<ul>
<li>There’s none (the mp4 doesn’t include audio, and neither does the BPG.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animation support.</strong> You can have a GIF half the size of an MP4.</li>
<li><strong>Video inline play</strong> (but without sound). One of the biggest problems is that on Mobile Safari no video can be played inline. GIFs solve, and when we have GIFs that are 5% the size of the original, that’s epic!</li>
<li><strong>High compression ratio.</strong> Smaller than a JPG and even smaller than Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/">WebP</a> with similar quality if not better.</li>
<li><strong>You can start using today</strong> with a Javascript decoder (gzipped size: 56 KB).</li>
<li><strong>And plenty other</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>GIFs today are not even GIFs anymore. With the release of Imgur’s <a href="https://imgur.com/blog/2014/10/09/introducing-gifv/">gifv</a> the internet went nuts for nothing more than a mp4 that has autoplay, and if mp4’s are not supported, or autoplay is disabled (mobiles), they’re replaced with very low quality GIFs.</p>
<h3 id="downsides">Downsides?</h3>
<p>We got just a few…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decompiling time!</strong> - Current example is around 8-10s (the bigger the file, the slower the decompiling)… This would be easily solved if browsers would add native support.</li>
<li><strong>Main thread blocking</strong> while decompiling large files.</li>
<li><strong>No sound support</strong> (but who cares, this is image encoding, we’re not talking better video formats).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-what-can-we-do">So what can we do?</h3>
<p>Why not go ahead and promote it so that browsers actually support it. Or you can start using it today, it requires some CPU processing, but hey! We’re saving bandwidth! :D</p>
<p>For example there’s a feature request on the Bugzilla Tracker of Firefox - <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1111277">here</a></p>
<p>Or share this article if you liked it! :D</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>For a beginner, it is not an easy task to understand Docker. I will admit that I have struggled with using and understanding containers for a long time and I still have a lot to work on. There is a ton of subtleties that goes into solidly grasping the concepts behind Docker, why it is so revolutionary, and why even a budding programmer might benefit from learning it and using it.</p>
<p><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/f9Rrghj6TDckb5nZZR/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47kyxuoduhgc2jfofwhix1gvnhxbp4spk29x3p5r0g&amp;rid=giphy.gif" alt="It is amazing"></p>
<p>This is my humble attempt to channel hours and hours of headaches, despair, and a-ha! moments into a beginner-friendly, digestible format. This is the first in a series of articles, and I hope it will give you a headstart in your Docker journey!</p>
<h2 id="some-history">Some history</h2>
<p>The typical way of writing software was simple. A developer works on his local machine, installing a bunch of packages, setting up the environment, etc. Once the necessary code was in good shape, our dev friend shares the code to the ops folks, and... it doesn't work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> Your code doesn't work.</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> Hey it worked on my machine!</p>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> What version of <code>XXX</code> do you run?</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> I have no idea, man...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, a very long time was spent troubleshooting dev environments instead of shipping features and improvements.</p>
<p>The solution to that was found in <strong>hypervisors</strong> and <strong>Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong>. With VMs, you can spin up as many development and test environments as you see fit, each configured for different operating systems. Just boot up a VM, configure the environments as you need them, develop software, test it, and your job is done! But how does all of this work? What are VMs? Let's look at the architecture of a computer running VMs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596313897133/V0-9594IP.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Types of VM"></p>
<p>There are a lot of terms that you might not know, so let's go through them. The <strong>infrastructure</strong> is the computer hardware, meaning CPU, RAM, SSDs and hard disks, motherboards, and anything else is part of the physical components of the host machine. The <strong>Host OS</strong> is the operating system that is installed on the infrastructure. As an example, if you were to purchase a MacBook, the aluminum shell and all the components are part of the infrastructure, while MacOS is the Host Os.</p>
<p>The <strong>hypervisor</strong> is a piece of software that handles the creation of Virtual Machines. Each of these VMs can run their independent process, as they believe they are using the hardware resources from the infrastructure. In reality, the hypervisor allocates hardware from the pool of resources that the infrastructure makes available. In simplest terms, it creates a virtual representation of portions of the Host Machine hardware and lets Virtual Machine run on those, managing the resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596306270830/a10Buy6vP.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="How does a hypervisor work?"></p>
<p>As you can see from the diagram, are two types of hypervisors, depending on where they sit in the system architecture. </p>
<h4 id="bare-metal-hypervisors-type-1-">Bare-Metal Hypervisors (Type 1):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed directly on the hardware and embedded in its components. In this case, there is no Host OS on these infrastructures. These are the most common type of hypervisors used in production environments, as they are more secure and have a higher performance by being so close to the machine level.</p>
<h4 id="hosted-hypervisors-type-2-">Hosted Hypervisors (Type 2):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed on an operating system. If you have played with VMs, this is most likely the type of hypervisor that you have used. Simply think of Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion, or any of the major VM providers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596309047453/pww4mOHmh.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Bare-metal vs Hosted Hypervisors"></p>
<p>The important point to note here is that, while a hypervisor provides all the resources and virtualized hardware, it does not provide an operating system. This is where the <strong>Guest OS</strong> plays its part, as the OS that is running on the VM. These are fully-fledged OS, including all the additional pieces of software needed to make the system run. This introduces a ton of additional bloat to the process and reduces the number of VMs that a single host can run.</p>
<p>Think about installing any OS. A fresh installation of Windows, for example, also comes with all the usual additional applications and supporting software. I doubt that our production-grade Nginx server will make plenty of use of a shiny copy of Paint 3D. </p>
<h2 id="enter-docker">Enter Docker</h2>
<p>A container solves the timeless problem of "IDK, man. It works on my machine" and the performance overheads of VMs by providing you a portable, replicable image of your development environment that can run on any OS. When an application is containerized, it is bundled with all of its dependencies. In this way, if I want to run the application on a different machine, I don't need to install anything else other than Docker, as all that makes my application tick comes embedded with the Docker Image.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is that Docker runs its containers directly on our machine's <strong>kernel</strong>. The kernel is the very low-level program that has complete control over both software and hardware in your computer, allowing the two to communicate.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596317886484/oQnh3758L.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Where kernel sits in a computer"></p>
<p>All of the Docker container's processes run along with the main operating system's processes, albeit in a logically isolated fashion. This isolation is made possible by utilities in the Linux kernel, specifically <strong>LXC</strong> (LinuX Containers), <strong>cgroups</strong> (control group), and <strong>namespaces</strong>. The specifics of how these work are a little tricky, but we will explore them in a future tutorial. </p>
<p>Docker is built off of these utilities, extending them and making them easy to use with a high-level API, called the Docker Engine. The Docker Engine is a REST API that can be accessed via HTTP or, most commonly, through a command-line interface. It sends instructions to the Docker Daemon, a constantly running background process that manages every interaction between Docker containers and the machine's kernel.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596302358014/I12LtIqFL.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Levels of interaction with Docker"></p>
<h4 id="comparing-docker-with-vms">Comparing Docker with VMs</h4>
<p>Let's look again at the VM architectural diagram and let's compare it to how Docker does its things.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596298477648/alMXfcmFx.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="VM vs containers"></p>
<p>This is where Docker has an advantage over VMs. Given that, as we explained before, the containers use the kernel of the host to run their processes, there is no overhead to run a container. A container has no kernel booting to do, it uses only the processes that are necessary to run the containerized application, it stops whenever my application stops and does not occupy hardware resources while not in use.</p>
<h4 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>Docker is a quick way to package applications in the environment that they were developed in, making sure that they can run no matter the underlying infrastructure, configuration, or OS.</p>
<h4 id="even-more-tl-dr">Even more TL;DR</h4>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596235460123/5sSjCOnwM.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="How Docker was born"></p>
<h2 id="some-docker-jargon">Some Docker jargon</h2>
<p>We explained what Docker is why it is great, but you surely have heard of Dockerfiles, Docker images, Docker containers, and maybe others. Let's clarify what those things mean.</p>
<h4 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h4>
<p>Docker images are read-only files that are to build containers. They include everything that the containerized process needs to run, such as source code, dependencies, runtimes, and objects. Most crucially, it provides a private filesystem to the container. Images are lightweight, portable, and can be used to deploy applications quickly and at scale. Every image is built from a Docker-specific script called a Dockerfile. </p>
<h4 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h4>
<p>A Dockerfile is a recipe that provides <em>mostly</em> clear and sequential instructions on how to build an image. A Dockerfile is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which creates a new layer. We will cover layers in a later installment of this series, but for now, we can think of these as building blocks that can be individually cached (i.e. saved to memory) for future builds.</p>
<h4 id="docker-container">Docker Container</h4>
<p>Once we build an image from a Dockerfile, we can finally deploy it as a container. Containers are nothing more than instances of Docker images. Multiple containers can run at the same time on the same machine and multiple containers can be instantiated from the same Docker image. Containers live for the time it takes for their processes to run or until they fail. </p>
<p>Combined with an extremely fast start time, we can see why they are valuable in environments that need to scale quickly. We can start as many containers as our underlying infrastructure can handle or as much as our manually allocated resources allow and we can get rid of them just as quickly.</p>
<h4 id="docker-registry">Docker Registry</h4>
<p>If we want to control every detail of our services on our own, we can write a Dockerfile that specifies every single step of the way to get there. But in most use cases we might be interested in running pre-built images of services that we use daily. For that reason, we can browse  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, an online registry of pre-built images of various software, from commonly used applications like databases (MySQL, Redis, Postgres, etc...), web servers (Nginx, Apache), or CMS (WordPress) to development environments in most languages (Python, Node.js, Java, etc...).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596243680676/_m6HenMF4.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Explore-Docker-Hub.png"></p>
<p>The images that you build through your Dockerfiles can be pushed to the various registries, either to DockerHub if we want to make them publicly available or registries like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS Elastic Container Registry</a>,  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry">GCP Container Registry</a> if we want to keep them private. If we want our images to be uber-private, we can also host our private registry by running a local instance of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/registry">Docker Registry</a>, which is available as a Docker image on Docker Hub.</p>
<p>We have now a better idea of the basic building blocks of Docker. We can also identify the cycle of Docker containers, from creation to instantiation.
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596255174293/jg6QyfiZV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Docker Lifecycle"></p>
<h2 id="next-steps-">Next steps?</h2>
<p>Whew! That was already a lot of information to digest! Make sure you understand the underlying concepts of Docker and why so many developers love the fact that it is in this world. In Part 2 of this series, we will start getting our feet wet with the Docker CLI, pull a few images from Docker Hub, and get experience with properly running containers in various use cases.</p>
<p>For now, if you want, keep in touch with me via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/antonio_lofiego">Twitter</a> and let me know what you think about this guide. I hope you liked your first steps with Docker because it's gonna be a hike!</p>

The exterior construction quality is absolutely top notch. Insides are pretty rough, but that's to be expected for 80's manufacturing capabilities. They didn't have access to specialized tapes (Nitto) and a whole bunch of industries that cater to small electronics manufacturing. If you ever open an iPhone, there is a tremendous amount of systems engineering and DFM/DFA that has lead to a boom in making parts that aid assembly.</p><p>What I admire about CASIO is that they have a consistent design language and I don't mean just the aesthetics. The way they construct their products, the way they make them usable and understandable to the user, the way they communicate the state of the system, the operability, etc. This design language changed over time as the company evolved. The family of products that released in 1983 were different than 1993 in terms of design.</p><p>If somone designed a calculator today, they would most likely be made from ABS plastic, in a clamshell case. An ARM microcontroller that replaces essentially 70% of the chips, and it would be impossible to repair. LCD would be glued in, self tapping screws, and no extra-mile attemps to increase the quality. Infact, the opposite. Modern electronics just feel like everyone is trying to race to the bottom, cut costs at all costs!</p>

          <p><h3><span>An Overview of the Journey</span></h3></p> <p><span>This is a write-up of the 6-month journey of running e-commerce stores that started in Feb 2017. Within two months of iterations, we were making mid-4-figure revenue per month. We eventually stopped when the paid traffic got more costly, and the experimentation became too time-consuming. </span></p> <p><span>While it was not a big success by any means, I hope other entrepreneurs and hustlers out there have something to gain from this case study. </span></p> <p><span>In the spirit of transparency, I will share all the details about the experience, including the day-by-day payout. If there are parts you would like to see more details on, </span> <a href="https://twitter.com/jhlyeung" target="_blank"><span>tweet at me</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>Here are some numbers for one of the dropshipping stores we had. We will dive into more details in the sections below. </span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/10dc06ec-da7f-4513-8b37-6c17f9f48df5/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195239Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=8e0371bdd6fe0b12f7ac92c0736c17cd0b656d4058c36f38692590967a3d03b8&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><h3><span>The Beginning - Excitement and big goals</span></h3></p> <p><span>Like many internet entrepreneurs, we started looking into e-commerce for "side hustle" ideas, to get us closer to financial freedom and all that good stuff.</span></p> <p><span>We started brainstorming ideas of things we could sell, and attempted to build a brand that would reflect our own desires: minimalist but stylish fashion for men. </span></p> <p><span>We quickly put together a Shopify site, picked a few products to dropship, and launched our first brand </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/norwoodlane" target="_blank"><span>Norwood Lane</span></a> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>On paper, dropshipping sounded so appealing: </span> <em>no risk, no need for inventory, high profit margin</em> <span>. All we had to do is pick the right products and find buyers!  It would be profitable as long as customer acquisition cost (CAC) + cost of buying the product from a Chinese supplier is lower than what we sell the item for. Simple unit economics!</span></p> <p><span>We had high hopes, and started dreaming about where the brand can go: which countries to expand to next, how many designers we were going to hire for our own branded products, where we will have our physical locations, which influencers we should reach out to first to promote our products, when I should decide to turn down the job offer from Microsoft...</span></p> <p><span>Very quickly though, reality just hit us in the face...</span></p> <p><span>We were running Facebook and Instagram ads at the time, but </span> <em>the few sales that we made were at a loss</em> <span>.</span></p> <p><strong>Things we tried:</strong> <span> ﻿</span></p> <p><li><span>Targeting different audiences with the ads</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different ad copies</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different product offerings: different types of wallets, watches, and other accessories</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different price points</span></li></p> <p><em>None of that worked.</em></p> <p><span>A few weeks in, it was time for Plan B! The products we were selling at that price point weren't working. We needed to iterate.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Systematically testing product ideas</span></h3></p> <p><span>We decided to launch two more dropshipping stores in parallel - one to test ideas, another to double down on the winning ones:</span></p> <div><li><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theooustore/" target="_blank"><span>The Oou Store</span></a> <span>: selling fun/cute gimmicky gifts. A general gift shop, where we would very quickly test product ideas (along with ad copies).</span></li></div> <p><li><span>A more specialty shop branded around the winning products. We would rebrand it depending on what products seemed to show promise.</span></li></p> <p><span>Each day, we would try an average of 3-5 new products, following this process:</span></p>  <p><li><span>Pick a few that we think could sell, add them to our catalog</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Run 2-3 Facebook ad copies in parallel for each product</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Check responses to the ads a day or two later </span></li></p> <p><span>This was an ongoing process. And after a few weeks of trying many ideas, </span> <em>we finally found a few winners.</em> <span> We found product-ad combos that we could repeatedly profit from.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Examples of products we tried</span></h3></p> <p><span>We tried a variety of products targeted at different niches. Here are some of the more popular items:</span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cc718120-451e-45f4-99c1-09cbde8627c1/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195107Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=7e22925f4c8f52d02ee569f3093de6861ed0aefe5b79db1c1a163a9cd1e0ce8a&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><span>...and some less successful ones: </span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cbfe0681-f35f-475a-be81-4dda8603de98/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195127Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=0e89220104974d5015b313efa4866b04c500b97dd8c7e3ae10e3ab52778f622f&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p>  <p><span>In general, it seemed that the more niche the audience, the better the product performed. But finding a winning product is part art, part science. There were many products that we thought would be winners that flopped, and vice versa.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Doubling down on the winning products</span></h3></p> <p><span>One of the items that started picking up in sales was a flamboyant rash guard featuring a oriental-esque mythical creature:</span></p> <p><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9ee2cde0-474d-4bb9-aee6-82e8408587e9/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20200801%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20200801T195152Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=545de8bbe5c384fca3b4668795bca49bbb3a3fc6c79e24d9562a517907b44628&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22"></p> <p><span>First there was order, then another on the same day. Then there was another. We knew something was working.</span></p> <p><span>We moved fast to create a specialty store front to brand around this - </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Precision-Fightwear-246986475709277/" target="_blank"><span>Precision Fightwear</span></a> <span>, selling MMA/BJJ training gear. </span></p> <p><span>With the more focused brand, we expanded the product catalog, and replicated the ad campaigns that worked by reallocating our ad spends to the winning products. We curated a few more similar designs from various suppliers, and build our best-selling </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=249898468751411&amp;id=246986475709277" target="_blank"><span>Mythical Creatures Collection</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>We were pricing each product at $40-50 a piece. And we would purchase them from our suppliers for $10-20 each. Our shipping time to the US would be around two weeks, which was an issue for some customers. To address this, we simply had a dedicated email address for shipping inquiries, and manually answered them as soon as we received them. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Distribution channels stop working at some point</span></h3></p> <p><span>Our main marketing channel was paid ads. Facebook ads in particular. We had tried other ad platforms, such as Instagram and Google / Bing ads. But it was with Facebook ads that we were able to consistently make a profit, thanks partly to the great targeting capabilities.</span></p> <p><span>As Charlie Munger would say: repeat what works. We happily did that.</span></p> <p><span>It worked, but only it didn't.</span></p> <p><span>By July, we were starting to see losses on some days, though sales where still coming in. The cost of running ads and buying the products from our suppliers exceeded what we were making from our customers. </span></p> <p><span>Apparently this is common pattern for internal marketing channels in general. So much so that Andrew Chen termed it the </span> <a href="https://andrewchen.co/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/" target="_blank"><span>Law of Shitty Click-throughs</span></a> <span>, and described it as a "strong gravitational pull".</span></p> <p><span>We tried a few more things to fight this gravity. Tweaked the ad copy. Changed the ad audience. We created new product lines, selling Muay Thai gears, and even started selling our own branded rashguard (custom designed, not dropshipped). </span></p> <p><span>A lot of time spent, not much results. A few more months later, we finally decided to wind down the store and put our energy on other projects.</span></p> <p><span>It could have been that we exhausted the niche within MMA enthusiasts. Or that ads were getting more competitive. Or that competitors popped up (a particularly severe issue with dropshipping businesses). There were many factors at play, and we would never know exactly why it stopped working.</span></p>  <p><span>Looking back, it was a good run. Going in with zero prior experience forced us to learn on the fly. And when there were customers banging on our doors, we had no choice but to get our acts together.</span></p> <p><span>Going forward, I don't think dropshipping is for me. It requires a constant effort to keep testing and promoting product ideas. And the process can get exhausting. The flip side of the low-touch model is that it comes with a low level of control. Too many things can eventually go wrong that would be hard to fix, for it to be a sustainable business model.</span></p>

  <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/materials.jpg">
These are all the materials we will use. A cell phone, and a linear polarizer filter sheet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your cell phone (or any display/light).</li>
  <li>
    <p>A polarization sheet such as the one in the link below.</p>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/em_wave.png">
    Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/58f0fd7e7c0149308e221579
</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/sunglasses.png">
    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjaAxUO6-Uw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png">
    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png" alt="Experiment 2"></p>

    <ul>
      <li>With 45º&nbsp;filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png" alt="Experimenet 3"></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_2.png">
</p>

<p>In Step 2, vertically …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When Jack Rhysider started <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/"><i>Darknet Diaries</i></a>, he had a blog that got a few thousand hits per day, 3,000 Twitter followers, and a full-time job as a network security engineer. Now, nearly three years and over 70 episodes later, the podcast has been downloaded over 8 million times. The show, which tells “true stories of the dark side of the internet”—including disturbing tales of hacking, data breaches, and cybercrime— is now a full-time job&nbsp; and pays for a production team.</p><blockquote><p>“I threw up my hands and was like, ‘well forget this. I guess people are already doing this.’”</p></blockquote><p>Rhysider is not only humble about his incredible success—he says you can grow a successful show, too. How? He breaks it down into three steps: Make an excellent show, grow your audience, and monetize it—in that order.</p><hr><p><b>Make an Amazing Show</b></p><p><span>Rhysider quickly realized that part of what made his show stand out was not just the stories he was telling, but the way he told them. “We all have different ways that we’ve grown up and the way we look at the world,” he explains. Owning that singularity was one key to Rhysider’s success.</span></p><p><span>When he launched the first four episodes in the fall of 2017, he didn’t see any other podcasters in the high-drama cybersecurity stories space. As soon as he launched, however, he recalls, “I found four shows that were doing the same thing,” which made him “furious” and nearly caused him to quit. “I threw up my hands and was like, ‘well forget this. I guess people are already doing this.’”</span></p><p><span>But he quickly realized he was giving his listeners an experience no one else was offering. any cybersecurity stories were either being told “in very dry and technical ways” or they came out in discrete chunks as the stories unfolded in real time. In contrast, he waited “until the chips had fallen” to let listeners hear the entire story from start to finish in one compelling episode.</span></p><figure id="attachment_359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-359"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="295" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1024x503.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-768x377.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1536x755.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20295'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1024x503.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-768x377.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1536x755.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing.jpg 2000w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-359">Image provided by Rhysider</figcaption></figure><p><span>Not only was he creating stories with a distinct, compelling arc, he was also very deliberate in his delivery, leaning heavily on other creators for inspiration. As the saying goes, “good artists borrow, great artists steal.”</span></p><p><span>“When I started podcasting I was stealing everything I could,” Rhysider says. He listened carefully to podcasters including Ira Glass, Malcolm Gladwell, and Aaron Mehnke. One of his signature sounds—making it sound like two people are talking, when there is only one—came directly from the true-crime podcast </span><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/dirty-john/"><i><span>Dirty John</span></i></a><span>. “They pan to the left and talked with a little filter, and then they pan to the right and talk with a different filter and it was the same narrator.” He remembers thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s so cool. I’m gonna try that.’</span></p><p><span>Podcasters weren’t his only creative influences. At one point, Rhysider sought to emulate the </span><i><span>Fight Club</span></i><span> narrator. “I realized he’s got insomnia, so I need to stay up till 3 am and then try to record the episode at 3 am,” he recalled.</span></p><p><span>Rhysider is adamant that a quality show depends on excellent storytelling—and that you can cultivate that skill. He recommends buying books on podcasting, taking courses, and focusing not just on the technology but the content itself. He says it’s not just “what mic to use, but how to tell a great story and how to be entertaining.”</span></p><p><span>With practice and plenty of study, Rhysider found his own groove: “By Episode 30 or so I had my own voice and my own style.” Clearly, it’s working. The show, which saw 800 downloads per episode in the first week, was rated among the</span> <a href="https://lists.pocketcasts.com/top-podcasts-2019"><span>top 25</span></a><span> podcasts of 2019 by Pocketcasts.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to Rhysider, “if you don’t make something great, you’re gonna lose your listeners, which means you have to get new listeners faster than you’re losing the listeners. And that’s difficult.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When you create a great show, you naturally gain what Rhysider calls “superfans,” people who are so excited about it, who want to share it with their friends and family. “They go into the office and they say, ‘You have to listen to this,’ or they tell their friend, ‘You have to listen to this,’ that’s number one,” he explains.</span></p><hr><p><b>Show Promotion to Grow Your Audience</b></p><p><span>Having spent four months toiling over the first four episodes, Rhysider knew he had something special and began promoting the show right away. He relied on traditional social media marketing strategies, creativity, and, when it came to Facebook, luck.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><figure id="attachment_369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-369"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1332" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-300x156.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1024x533.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-768x400.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1536x799.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-2048x1065.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%201332'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-300x156.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1024x533.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-768x400.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1536x799.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-2048x1065.jpg 2048w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-369">Who is the real Jack Rhysider? Looks like he’s doing something to protect his identity from Google Images.</figcaption></figure><p><span>It turned out, Rhysider had a friend at Facebook “who had a budget to play with.” His friend ended up gifting him $4,000 worth of Facebook ads. In return, his friend experimented with running different types of ad campaigns and had access to the analytics data.</span></p><p><span>Despite not being a huge fan of social media, Rhysider felt his show couldn’t have experienced turbo-charged growth without it. He referred to it as “a magic megaphone that you should not squander.”</span></p><p><span>Rhysider, in fact, only joined Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn after launching </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span>, in order to promote the show. Early on, he invested $500 on paid promotions with Instagram influencers, which he said helped him reach the 5,000 follower mark. From there, he focused on more organic growth on Instagram, continuing to post regularly and interacting with other accounts that were similar to his. He also used Reddit to help grow his audience.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, Rhysider has increased the show’s visibility by taking advantage of other types of networking opportunities. He’s given out </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span> stickers at the many conferences he’s spoken at, has been a guest on about 20 podcasts, and has successfully pitched his show to journalists who mentioned it in publications including </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/arts/podcasts-tech-science.html"><i><span>The New York Times</span></i></a><span>, Vulture, and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/17/grenfell-dust-on-our-lips-darknet-diaries-tip-off-observer-radio-reviews"><i><span>The Guardian</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p><hr><p><b>Monetize</b></p><p><span>With a top-notch show, a huge following, and a strategic approach to monetization, Rhysider has nailed the financial aspect of podcasting. Burnt out on his full-time job, he quit work six months after launching and was able to earn a full-time living six months after that, at the end of 2018. By the beginning of 2019, he had the means to hire additional producers, artists, sound designers, an editor, and a writer.</span></p><p><span>According to one of Rhysider’s </span><a href="https://lime.link/blog/4-methods-for-finding-sponsors-for-your-podcast/"><span>recent blog posts</span></a><span> on Lime Link, he has monetized through ads for the past two years and he’s been very intentional in his approach. Rather than using networks, which wanted to put more ads in his show than he was comfortable with, he uses AdvertiseCast, Megaphone MTM, and Affiliate Ads. “AdvertiseCast does fairly well filling up my ad slots, but because I’m hosted on Megaphone it’s just a matter of enabling MTM and if I have any unfilled ad slots, ads get automatically added in.” Although he said MTM “doesn’t pay very well,” he feels its simple set-up and low-maintenance make it worthwhile. “And if I want to throw in the occasional affiliate deal, then hey why not?” he says, adding,&nbsp; “I typically go for affiliate deals when the sponsor has one but isn’t interested in paying for ads, they just want to pay for results.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Regarding Rhysider’s three-pronged approach to building a successful podcast, he’s clear about one thing: No amount of social media promotion or attempts to monetize will work if you don’t have the foundation of a fantastic show that retains listeners. Beyond that, he hesitates to attribute </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span>’ exponential growth to any one strategy. Rather, he likens his success to the effort it takes to complete a cross-country bicycle trip. “It’s like a flywheel that you keep pushing.”&nbsp;</span></p> </div></div>]]>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on August 01, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's blog post is about solving the "Task Ordering" problem in Python.
You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to solve the problem using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force</a>.</li>
<li>How to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn's_algorithm">Khan's Algorithm</a> to solve the problem more efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have a list of tasks that you need to complete. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task A</strong> - do the dishes.</li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong> - wash your clothes.</li>
<li><strong>Task C</strong> - dry your clothes.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> - go for a run.</li>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> - have dinner.</li>
</ul>
<p>But you can't complete the tasks randomly.
You have some constraints. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> must be done before <strong>Task A</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task B</strong> and <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong> must be done before <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task E</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal is to find a way to complete the tasks in order and not violate the constraints.
E.g. one solution is</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Task D</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task E</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task C</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task A</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I represent the list of tasks as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset">set</a>. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>{ "A", "B", "C", "D", "E" }
</code></pre>
<p>I represent the constraints as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionary</a> that maps each task to the set
of tasks that must come <strong>after</strong>. E.g. this constraint dictionary</p>
<pre><code>{
    "E": {"A"},
    "D": {"B", "C"},
    "B": {"C"},
    "D": {"E"},
}
</code></pre>
<p>represents these constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> must be done before <strong>Task A</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task B</strong> and <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong> must be done before <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task E</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I represent the solution as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">sequence</a> of tasks. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>("D", "E", "B", "C", "A")
</code></pre>

<p>A simple way to use brute force to solve this problem is to generate every
permutation of tasks and check if it satisfies the constraints.
Here's a Python function, <code>task_order_bf</code>, that does this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>from itertools import permutations, combinations


def task_order_bf(*, tasks, constraints):
    """Solve the 'Task Ordering' problem using brute force.
    
    tasks -- a set of tasks.
    constraints -- a dictionary that maps each task to
        all the tasks that must come after.
    """
    for candidate in permutations(tasks):
        good = all(
            before not in constraints[after]
            for before, after in combinations(candidate, 2)
            if after in constraints
        )
        if good:
            return candidate


tasks = {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E"}
constraints = {
    "E": {"A"},
    "D": {"B", "C"},
    "B": {"C"},
    "D": {"E"},
}

task_order_bf(tasks=tasks, constraints=constraints)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>('D', 'E', 'A', 'B', 'C')
</code></pre>
<p>This code generates all possible orders of the tasks (ignoring constraints)
using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations">itertools.permutations</a>.</p>
<p>This code checks each candidate by using the built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all">all</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations">itertools.combinations</a> to make sure that for every pair of elements</p>
<blockquote>
<p>( ... <var>before</var> ... <var>after</var> ... )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That <strong>Task <var>before</var></strong> is allowed to be before <strong>Task
<var>after</var></strong>.</p>
<p>What's the time complexity of this solution? For <var>n</var> tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <var>n</var><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">!</a> permutations of the <var>n</var> tasks.</li>
<li>Checking that a permutation satisfies the constraints takes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O</a>(<var>n</var><sup>2</sup>) operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the overall time complexity of this function is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>! <var>n</var><sup>2</sup>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This problem of "Task Ordering" is also known also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">"Topological Sorting"</a>.
The concepts of "tasks" and "constraints" map to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)">vertices</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#edge">edges</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a>.</p>
<p>For a directed graph with vertices <var>V</var> and edges <var>E</var>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn's_algorithm">Khan's
Algorithm</a> performs a topological sort in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality">|<var>V</var>|</a> + |<var>E</var>|) steps</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a Python function, <code>task_order_fast</code>, that solves the "Task Ordering"
problem using Khan's Algorithm:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict


def task_order_fast(*, tasks, constraints):
    """Solve the 'Task Ordering' problem quickly, using
    Khan's Algorithm for topological sorting.

    """
    return khans_algorithm(V=tasks, E=constraints)


def khans_algorithm(*, V, E):
    """Use Khan's Algorithm to generate a topological sort
    of a directed graph given by vertices V and edges E.

    # Set up auxiliary data structures and functions.

    e_out = defaultdict(set)

            unlink(tail, head)
            if source(head):

    # If cycles are present, then no solution exists.

}

<p>In this week's post, you learned how to solve the "Task Ordering" problem using
brute force. Then you learned how to recast the problem in terms of topological
sorting. This allowed you to use Khan's algorithm to create a faster solution
to the "Task Ordering" problem.</p>
<p>Topological sorting is useful for dependency resolution in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation">build systems</a>
(like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">package managers</a> (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>).</p>
<p>In a mathematical sense, topological sorting is like creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_extension">linear
extension</a> from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set#Formal_definition">partial order</a> to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">total order</a>.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A solution can't exist if the task constraints form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory)">cycle</a>. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task A</strong> comes before <strong>Task D</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> comes before <strong>Task E</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> comes before <strong>Task A</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As it is, the functions return <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy">None</a> when a solution is not found.</p>
<p>Your goal is to modify the code to, instead of returning None, raise an
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">Exception</a> that describes that constraints that are in conflict. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ERROR: Unable to order tasks. Tasks "A", "D", "E" form a cycle.</p>
</blockquote>

next week's post. See you then!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>Before reading, you can try out my <a href="https://jinay.dev/backprop-vis">interactive visualization
tool</a> for a primer on what I’ll discuss
below.</p>
<p>At their core, neural networks are functions. They take some input, perform a
series of computations, and produce an output. Though most networks operate
in the realm of vectors and matrices, it can be a useful exercise to see them
without the extra barrier of linear algebra. For this purposes of this
explanation, we will only cover single variable functions, but the principles
we will see can be extended into any number of dimensions.</p>

<p>Before we reach the backwards propagation of gradients, we will observe the
forward propagation of values. The forward pass provides a reasonable basis
for understanding how functions can be represented as the result of other
functions combined. Finally, we can represent these functions as a
computation graph—an idea which will be useful when we arrive at the
backward pass of the function.</p>
<h2>Function Composition</h2>
<p>We begin with the most basic function, mapping the entire range of inputs to a single number.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x) = 1 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Simple, right? Let’s try to incorporate <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into the mix by creating the identity function—any <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in will be the same <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> out.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(x) = x 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>The power comes when we can compose the functions using different operations,
building a new function from the existing ones. By composing functions
together, we can evaluate the individual functions before we evaluate the
parent.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x) = f(x) + g(x) = 1 + x 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Likewise, we can feed the output of one function as the input of another,
increasing the complexity of the overall function while retaining its
individual parts.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>7</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x) = 7x + 3 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(x) = x^2 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>7</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><msup><mo>)</mo><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x) = g(f(x)) = (7x + 3)^2 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Intuitively, a human would first calculate the value of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>7</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">7x+3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> before
squaring the result. This staged ordering creates a hierarchy of functions
that our algorithms can harness.</p>
<p>We see this type of hierarchy building when we build models in any machine learning library. What TensorFlow calls a “model” is just a series of computations composed into a single function.</p>
<pre><code>model = tf.keras.Sequential()

model.add(Dense(<span>512</span>))
model.add(Dense(<span>512</span>))
...
model.add(Dense(<span>32</span>))
model.add(Dense(<span>10</span>))


y = model.predict(X)
</code></pre>
<p>Every time we call <code>model.add()</code>, we are adding to the hierarchy that defines
our neural network. In machine learning, composed functions <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> defined
earlier are less like <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x)+g(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and more like</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>5</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>4</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x) = f_5(f_4(f_3(f_2(f_1(x))))). 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Each <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f_n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a layer in the network which produces an output by using the previous layer as input.</p>
<h2>Building a Computation Graph</h2>
<p>We can visualize a composed function’s structure as a tree, each layer
representing a different stage of the operation. In fact, most programming
languages use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree">parse tree</a> to
store and evaluate expressions in code. This representation gives us the
ability to view a function in terms of its component parts, recursing
down the levels until we find the constants and variables at the
very bottom.</p>
<p>For example, take the function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> given below.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msup></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>In machine learning, this is a function called the <em>sigmoid</em>, often written
as <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sigma(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Let’s see how we could break the sigmoid into a computation
tree.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/sigmoid1.svg" alt="sigmoid"></p>
<p>Notice how all four leaf nodes are either a constant or a variable. These
are the most elementary parts of any composite function. We can even give the
intermediate functions letter names to highlight how each node is built from its children.</p>

<p>Up until this point, viewing functions as hierarchies seems to add
unnecessary abstractions on a relatively simple topic. However, now that we have
observed how to compute the “forward pass” of a computation graph, we
can compute the reverse using an algorithm called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">backpropagation</a>.</p>
<h2>Gradient Descent</h2>
<p>In machine learning, the end goal is to <strong>minimize error on a loss
function</strong>, and modern software achieves this goal through an algorithm called
<em>gradient descent</em>. Though I will not attempt to explain the entirety of
gradient descent here, a basic understanding of how it works is essential for
understanding backpropagation.</p>
<p>Loss functions measure how much the outputs of a model, the neural network,
deviate from the labels in a dataset. Tuning the parameters of the model will
either increase or decrease that loss, and the goal is to find the set of
parameters that will give us the minimum loss. Through gradient descent, we
try to estimate which direction we should tune our model in order to achieve
the optimal settings.</p>
<p>Imagine we have a loss function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that measures the performance of a model with only one parameter, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. The graph of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> could look something like this graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/graph1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From this zoomed out perspective, the valley in the curve (where loss is the
lowest) is obvious. However, when we train a model, this view is
significantly smaller, giving us only information about how the loss curve looks
near the current value of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/graph2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Intuitively, we should follow the direction that has the steepest slope downwards to find the minimum. In mathematical terms, we want to look at the gradient of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and take a small step in the direction down that gradient.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/graph3.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Backpropagation</em> is the tool that helps a model find that gradient estimate so that we know which direction to move in.</p>
<h2>Backpropagation</h2>
<p>The gradient is a collection of slope calculations called the partial
derivatives. Both partial derivatives and gradients answer a question that is
fundamental to our purpose: how does a small change in a variable <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
respectively change the output function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. In machine learning, we want
to observe how changing <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> will change the loss.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let us revisit some of the basic rules of calculus that are
crucial to understanding backpropagation. When computing partial derivatves,
we consider other variables of the functions constants, so <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> represents any constant or variable other than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>

<p>There are many more rules, but these basics encompass a large portion of what
functions you might see in machine learning applications. However,
using only these rules, our function vocabulary is significantly
limited. We can only take partial derivatives for simple functions like <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>5</mn><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">5x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
or <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>3</mn><mi>x</mi></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3^x + 2x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> if we are clever. The essential property for achieving infinitely
complex functions is a rule most calculus classes group with the rest.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow></mfrac><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(g(x)) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial g} \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>The chain rule enables us to unravel the composed functions we discussed
earlier—giving us the ability to compute arbitrarily complex partial
derivatives and gradients. Using the computation graph we constructed
earlier, we can move backwards from the final result to find individual
derivatives for variables. This backwards computation of the derivative using
the chain rule is what gives backpropagation its name. We use the
<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial f}{\partial g}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and propagate that partial derivative
backwards into the children of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> .</p>
<p>As a simple example, consider the following function and its corresponding computation graph.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>4</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mo>)</mo><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(x)=(4x+1)^2 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/backprop1.svg" alt="simple example"></p>
<p>As earlier, we assign the intermediate computations letter names to use in
calculation. Let’s find <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the slope of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>,
when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x=1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. First, let’s compute the forward pass of the function, labelling
the intermediate values of each node until we reach <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(1)=25</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Starting from the top, let us find the partial derivatives of the
tree on the path down to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. As we traverse down the tree, it only makes sense to take the partial derivatives with respect to the branches that <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a part of.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mi>f</mi></msup><mo>→</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g=e^f \rightarrow \frac{\partial g}{\partial e}=fe^{f-1}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Since <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a direct child of g, the chain rule is not necessary here. Knowing the values of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from the forward pass, we can find a numerical value for the partial derivative.</p>

<p>The next node in the path is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, a direct child of the previous node <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. To

the addition rule. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial c}{\partial d}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is 0 since a small change in <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">d</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> makes no change in <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>

</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>To find the desired value of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>c</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial g}{\partial c}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, we can finally employ the chain rule.</p>

</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Finally, we arrive at node <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the node containing <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<p>We’ve arrived at the end of the path to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, giving us the final value of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = 40</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>I encourage you to revisit my <a href="https://jinay.dev/backprop-vis/">visualization
tool</a> and play around with various
functions, tracing the path of the gradients down to your original variables.
You might even want to try <code>(4*x+1)^2</code> and see how the gradients change as
<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> changes.</p>
<p>This simple algorithm for calculating partial derivatives on a computation
graph is very similar to the way neural networks are trained in libraries
like Tensorflow. A firm understanding on how the libraries work allows you to
expand your capabilities beyond the prepackaged layers they provide. More
importantly, it allows you to gain insight on the algorithms used every day to train
computers on any amount of data.</p>
<p>The task remains constant—minimize error on a loss function.</p>

<p>Tools shape both their user and their result.
Paradigms of C and C++ have molded generations of systems programmers, the ubiquity and staying power of both languages is a testament to their utility.
But the resultant software has suffered decades of <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">memory corruption CVEs</a>.</p>
<p>Rust, as a compiled language <a href="https://blog.discordapp.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f">without garbage collection</a>, supports what have traditionally been C/C++ domains.
This includes everything from high-performance distributed systems to microcontroller firmware.
Rust offers an alternative set of paradigms, namely <a href="https://depth-first.com/articles/2020/01/27/rust-ownership-by-example/">ownership and lifetimes</a>.
If you've never tried Rust, imagine pair programming alongside a nearly-omniscient but narrowly-focused perfectionist.
That's what the borrow checker, a compiler component implementing the ownership concept, can sometimes feel like.
In exchange for the associated learning curve, we get memory safety guarantees.</p>
<p>Like many in the security community, I've been drawn to Rust by the glittering promise of a safe alternative.
But what does "safe" actually mean on a technical level?
Is the draw one of moths to flame, or does Rust fundamentally change the game?</p>
<p>This post is my attempt to answer these questions, based on what I've learned so far.
Memory safety is a topic knee-deep in operating system and computer architecture concepts, so I have to assume formidable prior systems security knowledge to keep this post short-ish.
Whether you're already using Rust or are just flirting with the idea, hope you find it useful!</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-are-the-memory-safety-guarantees-in-terms-of-exploitability">What exactly are the "memory safety guarantees"? In terms of exploitability?</h2>
<p>Let's start with the good news. Rust largely prevents a major vector for information leakage and malicious code execution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stack protection:</strong> Classic stack-smashing is now an <em>exception</em> and not <em>memory corruption</em>; attempts to write past the end of a buffer will trigger a panic instead of leading to <em>buffer overflow</em>. Regardless of panic handling logic (e.g. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/panic-reset"><code>panic_reset</code></a>), your application could still be subject to <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html">Denial of Service (DoS)</a> attacks. This is why fuzzing Rust is <a href="https://blog.hackeriet.no/fuzzing-sequoia/">still worthwhile</a>. But, as the panic prevents attacker-controlled stack corruption, you won't fall victim to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">Arbitrary or Remote Code Execution (ACE and RCE, respectively)</a>. Attempts to read past the end of a buffer are similarly stopped, so <a href="https://blog.getreu.net/projects/embedded-system-security-with-Rust/">no Heartbleed-style bugs</a>. Enforcement is dynamic: the compiler inserts runtime bounds checks where necessary, incurring small performance overhead. Bounds checks are more effective than the stack cookies a C compiler might insert because they still apply when indexing linear data structures, an operation that's easier to get right with Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/index.html">iterator APIs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heap protection:</strong> Bounds checks and panic behavior still apply to <a href="https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/">heap-allocated</a> objects. In addition, the ownership paradigm eliminates dangling pointers, preventing <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html">Use-After-Free (UAF)</a> and <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html">Double-Free (DF)</a> vulnerabilities: heap metadata is never corrupted. Memory leaks (meaning never freeing allocations, not over-reading data) are still possible if a programmer creates <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-06-reference-cycles.html">cyclical references</a>. Compile-time static analysis does the enforcement, soundly reasoning about abstract states representing all possible dynamic executions. There is no runtime cost. Effectiveness is maximal: the program simply can't enter a bad state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>References are always valid and variables are initialized before use:</strong> safe Rust doesn't allow manipulation of raw pointers, ensuring that pointer dereferences are valid. This means no <code>NULL</code> dereferences for DoS and no pointer manipulation for control flow hijack or arbitrary read/write. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html"><code>Option</code> type</a> facilitates error handling when <code>NULL</code> is a concept the programmer wishes to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/ffi.html#the-nullable-pointer-optimization">logically express</a>. These are compile-time guarantees, courtesy of ownership and lifetimes. A similar compile-time guarantee ensures variables can't be read until they've been initialized. Use of uninitialized variables is a warning in most modern C compilers; that aspect isn't novel. But ensuring valid dereferences certainly is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data races are completely eliminated:</strong> Rust's ownership system ensures that any given variable can only have one writer (e.g. a mutable reference) at any given program point, but an unlimited number of readers (e.g. immutable references). In addition to enabling memory safety, this scheme solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writers_problem">classic readers-writers concurrency problem</a>. Thus Rust eliminates data races, sometimes without the need for synchronization primitives or reference counting - but not <a href="https://youtu.be/ADbCqH7_SAs?t=669">race conditions in general</a>. Data race prevention reduces opportunities for <a href="https://www.redballoonsecurity.com/publications/papers/Concurrency_Attacks.pdf">concurrency attacks</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All good things in life come with a caveat. Let's look at the fine print:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Not all Rust code is memory safe:</strong> Satisfying the compiler's analyses is part of what makes implementing certain data structures, like <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/fourth.html">doubly-linked lists</a>, challenging in Rust. Moreover, certain low-level operations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O">Memory Mapped I/O (MMIO)</a>, are difficult to <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/register-rs">fully analyze</a> for safety. Blocks of code marked as <code>unsafe</code> are manually-designated "blindspots" for the analyses, bypassing safety-specific checks since the programmer vouches for their correctness. This includes parts of Rust's standard library, for which <a href="https://gts3.org/2019/cve-2018-1000657.html">CVE numbers have been assigned</a>, and, by extension, any external libraries called via C <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">Foreign Function Interface</a> (CFFI). Furthermore, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03296">researchers have found</a> that ownership's automatic destruction can create new (meaning unique to Rust) UAF and DF patterns in <code>unsafe</code> code. <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-silvestro.pdf">Hardened allocators</a>, which check heap consistency invariants dynamically, aren't entirely obsolete. Memory safety guarantees apply <em>broadly</em>, not <em>universally</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>unsafe</code> drops memory safety guarantees for a limited scope and doesn't eliminate all checks:</strong> <code>unsafe</code> isn't a free-for-all. Type, lifetime, and reference checks are still active; high-risk operations have explicit APIs (e.g. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.get_unchecked"><code>get_unchecked</code></a>). While memory corruption is possible with <code>unsafe</code>, the possibility is constrained to small portions of your codebase - around 1% of a typical Rust library <a href="https://youtu.be/NQBVUjdkLAA?t=1413">by one estimate</a>. From a security audit perspective, that's a colossal reduction in attack surface for a major bug class. Think of <code>unsafe</code> as a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">Trusted Computing Base (TCB)</a> in a larger system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interior mutability can push borrow checks to runtime:</strong> the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html">interior mutability pattern</a> allows multiple mutable aliases to a single memory location so long as they're not in use simultaneously. It's a sidestep of the borrow checker, a fallback when the problem can't be <a href="https://crates.io/crates/indextree">reframed in an idiomatic way</a> for powerful compile-time guarantees. Safe <em>wrappers</em> for <code>unsafe</code> APIs (e.g. <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>) verify exclusivity at runtime, incurring a performance penalty and introducing the potential to panic. I couldn't find metrics on how widely used this pattern is or isn't, but would again recommend <a href="https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/afl/tutorial.html">fuzzing</a> for probabilistic panic detection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, decades of hardware, OS, and compiler-level defenses have hardened C and C++ deployments.
Memory corruption 0-days aren't exactly low-hanging fruit.
Yet Rust still feels like a significant step forward and a noteworthy improvement to the security posture of performance-critical software.
Even though the <code>unsafe</code> escape hatch must exist, memory corruption - a large and vicious bug class - is largely eliminated.</p>
<p>So is Rust the new messiah, sent to save us from the hell of remote shell?
Definitely not.
Rust won't stop command injection (e.g. part of an input string ending up as an argument to <code>execve</code>).
Or misconfiguration (e.g. fallback to an insecure cipher).
Or logic bugs (e.g. forgetting to verify user permissions).
No general purpose programming language will make your code inherently secure or formally correct.
But at least you don't have to worry about these kinds of mistakes <em>and</em> maintaining <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2019/apr/21/modern-c++-wont-save-us/">complex, invisible memory invariants</a> throughout your Rust codebase.</p>
<h2 id="ok-what-about-embedded-systems-aren-t-those-super-vulnerable">OK, what about embedded systems? Aren't those super vulnerable?</h2>
<p>Let's assume "embedded" means no OS abstractions; the software stack is a single, monolithic binary (e.g. AVR or Cortex-M firmware) or part of the OS itself (e.g. kernel or bootloader). Rust's <a href="http://cliffle.com/blog/m4vga-in-rust/#on-no-std"><code>!#[no_std]</code> attribute</a> facilitates developing for embedded platforms.
<code>!#[no_std]</code> Rust libraries typically forsake dynamic collections (like <code>Vec</code> and <code>HashMap</code>) for portability to baremetal environments (no memory allocator, no heap).
The borrow checker barrier is minimal without dynamic memory, so prototyping ease remains roughly equivalent to embedded C - albeit with <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html">fewer</a> supported <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/specific.html">architectures</a>.</p>
<p>The resource-constrained and/or real-time embedded systems <code>!#[no_std]</code> targets often lack modern mitigations like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvug1Hup2iA">a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), No eXecute (NX), or Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)</a>.
We're talking about a lawless land where memory is flat and no one can hear you segfault.
But Rust still gives us that sweet, sweet bound check insurance when running baremetal without an allocator.
That's noteworthy because it might be the <em>first</em> and <em>last</em> line of defense in an embedded scenario.
Just remember that low-level interaction with hardware will probably require some amount of <code>unsafe</code> code, in which memory access without bounds check is opt-in.</p>
<p>For x86/x64, <em>stack probes</em> are also inserted by Rust the compiler to detect <em>stack overflow</em>.
At present, this feature doesn't apply to <code>!#[no_std]</code> or other architectures - although <a href="https://blog.japaric.io/stack-overflow-protection/">creative linking solutions</a> have been suggested.
Stack probes, often implemented via guard pages, prevent exhausting stack space due to unending recursion.
Bounds checks, on the other hand, prevent stack or heap-based <em>buffer overflow</em> bugs.
It's a subtle distinction, but an important one: for security, we typically care far more about the latter.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that memory, from the perspective of Rust, is a software abstraction.
When …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I was looking at one of my classic Macs a few weeks ago, and noticed that my Ubuntu 18.04 netatalk server wasn’t showing up in the Chooser anymore. If you’re not familiar with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">netatalk</a>, it’s an implementation of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol" target="_blank">Apple Filing Protocol (AFP)</a> that runs on Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and NetBSD. It allows other operating systems to act as Mac file servers. Version 2.x, which I use, supports the ancient AppleTalk protocol. This allows it to work with really old classic Macs that don’t even have a TCP/IP stack installed. Support for AppleTalk was removed in version 3.x, so that’s why I’m still using 2.x.</p>



<p>I checked out the server, and noticed that atalkd wasn’t running.</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ ps ax | grep atalkd<br>3351 pts/0 R+ 0:00 grep --color=auto atalkd</pre>



<p>Hmmm….why wouldn’t atalkd be running? I went ahead and tried to restart netatalk:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo service netatalk restart<br>Job for netatalk.service failed because the control process exited with error code.<br>See "systemctl status netatalk.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.</pre>



<p>Uh oh! Why won’t netatalk start?</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ systemctl status netatalk.service<br>● netatalk.service<br>Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/netatalk; generated)<br>Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Sat 2020-08-01 10:29:36 PDT; 54s ago<br>Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)<br>Process: 1320 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/netatalk start (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)<p>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: Starting netatalk.service…<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver netatalk[1320]: Starting Netatalk services (this will take a while): socket: Address family not supported by protocol<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver netatalk[1320]: socket: Address family not supported by protocol<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver netatalk[1320]: atalkd: can't get interfaces, exiting.<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: netatalk.service: Control process exited, code=exited status=1<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: netatalk.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.<br>Aug 01 10:29:36 miniserver systemd[1]: Failed to start netatalk.service.</p></pre>



<p>This setup had been working forever. What could have possibly changed? I was keeping up to date with all of my Ubuntu updates. I had already needed to <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/netatalk/+bug/1839015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manually patch the netatalk binary due to another bug</a>. Maybe I needed to reapply the patch? But no, the netatalk binary hadn’t been updated. That wasn’t it.</p>



<p>I tried some Googling and noticed that recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/appletalk?id=6cc03e8aa36c51f3b26a0d21a3c4ce2809c842ac" target="_blank">AppleTalk had been patched so that you can’t create raw sockets without the CAP_NET_RAW capability</a>, so I fiddled with setcap to set that capability on the atalkd binary, but that didn’t seem to fix anything, so I undid all the capability changes I tested.</p>



<p>After further experimentation, I realized that the appletalk kernel module wasn’t being loaded:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ lsmod | grep appletalk<br>doug@miniserver:~$</pre>



<p>Naturally, I tried to load it myself:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo modprobe appletalk<br>modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'appletalk': Cannot allocate memory</pre>



<p>Aha! There’s the real problem. Why can’t it allocate memory? I wondered if it was something specific to this particular machine. To test my theory, I headed over to my desktop Linux machine and ran the same modprobe command. It failed with the exact same error.</p>



<p>At this point after trying to do more research, I gave up for a while because I had more important stuff to worry about. It’s kind of difficult to search for info about this type of problem, because hardly anybody is using the AppleTalk networking layer in Linux anymore. “There are dozens of us!”</p>



<p>I finally came back and did some more troubleshooting. Since I knew it had worked before, I tried installing various kernel versions in a VM. Sure enough, Ubuntu’s 5.0.0 kernel worked fine. So this was definitely a kernel issue if I wasn’t already convinced.</p>



<p>Next, I tried <a href="https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bunch of upstream kernel versions</a>. I narrowed the problem down to sometime between kernels 5.0 and 5.1-rc1. Then I ran a git bisect between those versions, following the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBisection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instructions on the Ubuntu wiki for bisecting upstream kernels</a>. I also used “make localmodconfig” (followed by enabling appletalk in “make menuconfig”) to speed up the compile process after I noticed that most of the compile time was being spent building kernel modules that I wouldn’t be loading anyway.</p>



<p>The bisect process took quite a while. I probably should have figured out a way to automate it with qemu using a strategy similar to the one used in <a href="https://ldpreload.com/blog/git-bisect-run" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this excellent blog post</a>. But nevertheless, it finally settled on this commit from March 2019 being the start of the problem:</p>



<p><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6377f787aeb945cae7abbb6474798de129e1f3ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[6377f787aeb945cae7abbb6474798de129e1f3ac] appletalk: Fix use-after-free in atalk_proc_exit</a></p>



<p>This commit simply does a better job of checking return values of the functions called by atalk_init, and cleaning up properly if they fail. In particular, the return values of these functions, which were previously ignored, are now checked to ensure they succeed:</p>



<ul><li>sock_register</li><li>register_netdevice_notifier</li><li>atalk_proc_init</li><li>atalk_register_sysctl</li></ul>



<p>Further inspection revealed atalk_proc_init as the real culprit. <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/appletalk?id=e2bcd8b0ce6ee3410665765db0d44dd8b7e3b348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A refactor of atalk_proc_init, which happens to be the previous commit to the one linked above</a>, accidentally left the code in a state where it would return -ENOMEM instead of 0 on success. So it always returns -ENOMEM, regardless of success or failure. This explains the “Cannot allocate memory” error being reported when I attempted to insert the appletalk module.</p>



<p>Armed with this info, I did something really disgusting. I made a copy of the kernel module in /tmp and hacked it by tweaking bytes in a hex editor. A disassembly of atalk_proc_init reveals a line of code that loads a value of 0xFFFFFFF4 (-12) into the EAX register just before it exits. ENOMEM is defined as 12. So this is the line that’s causing it to return -ENOMEM. I simply hacked this line to load 0 into EAX instead. This basically leaves the logic working the same way it used to work before the two aforementioned patches were applied, because the return value was previously being ignored anyway.</p>



<p>Before:</p>



<pre>294:   b8 f4 ff ff ff          mov $0xfffffff4,%eax</pre>



<p>After:</p>



<pre>294:   b8 00 00 00 00          mov $0x0,%eax</pre>



<p>This hack by itself didn’t solve the problem:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo insmod /tmp/appletalk.ko<br>insmod: ERROR: could not insert module /tmp/appletalk.ko: Key was rejected by service</pre>



<p>The problem here is that Ubuntu’s kernel modules are signed. After hacking the binary, it no longer matched its signature. This is an indicator of just how ugly my hack is. So I did something even uglier: I stripped the signature out of the module completely:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ strip --strip-debug /tmp/appletalk.ko</pre>



<p>Then, I tried loading it again:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo insmod /tmp/appletalk.ko<br>doug@miniserver:~$</pre>



<p>Success! My dmesg log reports an error about a failed signature, thus tainting the kernel:</p>



<pre>[ 4479.495054] appletalk: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel</pre>



<p>But this doesn’t matter for my purposes. netatalk works now:</p>



<pre>doug@miniserver:~$ sudo service netatalk restart<br>doug@miniserver:~$ ps ax | grep atalkd<br>1698 ? S 0:00 /usr/sbin/atalkd<br>1716 pts/0 S+ 0:00 grep --color=auto atalkd</pre>



<p>Now I can store the hacked version of the module in the correct subdirectory in /lib/modules, and everything works automatically when I reboot. Yay!</p>



<p>This is a really ugly fix though. Whenever I upgrade my kernel, I’m going to have to manually patch it. That is, until the patch hits the mainline kernel, and then I can hope that Ubuntu pulls the fix into their kernel. The reason I’m documenting the binary patch here is because realistically, it’s going to take forever for the kernel fix to get released. I have no idea if it will be possible to convince Ubuntu to pull this fix into their kernels once it’s released. It’s not a high-priority bug fix because nobody uses AppleTalk anymore. And I don’t want to limit myself to an old kernel just for this silly reason.</p>



<p>So the first step here is to submit the patch to the linux-netdev mailing list, and get the fix merged into the mainline kernel. I searched the mailing list, and discovered that I wasn’t the first one to run into this bug. Actually, two separate people have both tried to fix it, but had their patches rejected for minor reasons:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=157058496118854&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH] net/appletalk: restore success case for atalk_proc_init()</a><ul><li>In this case, someone submitted a patch 10 months ago and was asked to tweak the patch. Then life got in the way (I totally understand), and he finally tried again about 9 months later:</li><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=159403465307674&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH v2] net/appletalk: restore success case for atalk_proc_init()</a></li><li>He was also asked to tweak the second patch because of a minor style issue (which I also understand). A third try at submitting the patch hasn’t been attempted as of this writing.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&amp;m=159541831715585&amp;w=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[PATCH 1/2] appletalk: Fix atalk_proc_init return path</a><ul><li>This is a more recent attempt from someone else, about a week and a half ago as of this writing. The author submitted this fix together with another unrelated AppleTalk patch, and the patch set was rejected for various minor issues (also understandable). A second version hasn’t been submitted as of this writing.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Obviously not too many people are using the appletalk kernel module these days, or else people would be up in arms about how it has been broken since kernel 5.1. I would offer up my own third attempt at getting this patch merged, but since two attempts were made just last month, I suspect one of them will succeed shortly. I hope so, anyway. In the meantime, I guess I’ll just continue binary patching my kernel module.</p>



<p>I think there is an even bigger long-term solution than this kernel fix. Classic Mac users who use netatalk with AppleTalk need to join forces to address a few things. netatalk 2.x is dead, but the last release of it is broken on Linux, at least the AppleTalk portion of it — which is the only reason I would still use it. Maybe we …</p></div></div>

It’s common to screw up the 95%, and the numbers work out that you have plenty of bugs in systems that are doing ‘easy’ things.</p><p>We should balance our attention for the majority of easy tasks and the minority of hard ones. Why do interviews only ask about knowledge that you need a few times a year, and not about habits you need every day? Should we use a language or platform that makes the routine code convenient, or the impressive code more impressive?</p><h3 id="reading">Reading</h3><blockquote><p>We are all sufferers from history, but the paranoid is a double sufferer, since he is afflicted not only by the real world, with the rest of us, but by his fantasies as well.</p></blockquote><p>I finally read <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/">The Paranoid Style in American Politics, the famous 1964 piece by Richard Hofstadter</a>.</p><p>It’s still relevant but I think two things have changed about the paranoid style:</p><ul><li>The paranoid people are winning. In Hofstadter’s time they were a marginal viewpoint: now they’re the default. The radius of QAnon and other fringe theories is staggeringly large right now. Even folks who don’t identify with Q casually accept many of its idiotic theories.</li><li>The obsession with citing facts in paranoid literature that Hofstadter mentions is no longer a thing: modern paranoia is untethered.</li></ul><h3 id="here-is-a-mild-take-on-javascript">Here is a mild take on JavaScript</h3><p>Using objects for data is one of the worst things about JavaScript. It’s really nice in other languages that you have one kind of object that’s part of your application and another that’s used for representing data. Ruby’s Hash, Python’s Dictionary, Java’s many datatypes, etc. JavaScript, traditionally, uses the same basic idea to represent all kinds of objects.</p><p>Basically every time that someone tries to use JavaScript objects for data, they write a security vulnerability by way of prototype pollution. The <code>Map</code> and <code>Set</code> datatypes help with this, but their relative unpopularity and inability to be directly serialized into JSON - and the fact that most developers are late to learn about them - means that a lot of people are just using objects for everything. And that’s, really often, a problem.</p><h3 id="the-core-cool-idea">The core cool idea</h3><p>My usual advice for <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/08/25/side-projects.html">finishing side projects</a> includes some variation on “be relentless about simplicity,” which translates into avoiding feature creep. The inverse is more instructive, though: know what the cool part is. For example, this month I <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1282123824901681153">made a small multiples visualization of a YouTube channel</a> that the internet generally liked. I made the project in one sitting and spent the last 45 minutes trying to make it interactive, so that you could click on the videos or hover over them and hear audio from each one. I was annoyed at this process because I was trying to implement it in a simple and lightweight way, and there was none. But I decided to avoid it: because making the thing interactive was too much work, but because I knew that what I had already made was the cool part. The interactivity might make it 10% cooler, but I had already done was the embodiment of the driving question, the implementation of the core cool idea.</p><p>Know what the core cool idea is. Side projects need one. If the core idea isn’t cool, you won’t be able to make the project cool by adding more stuff.</p><h3 id="politics">Politics</h3><p>I’m working through <a href="https://librivox.org/progress-and-poverty-by-henry-george/">Henry George’s Progress and Poverty as a free audiobook</a>, which has influenced my political-economic leanings from a distance for a while.</p><p>I think a bit about housing nowadays. I live in a major city with a housing crisis. Every single major American city has a housing crisis. Here’s one of my thoughts that I’m trying to refine:</p><p>Housing is both <em>real</em> (it can be used) and capital (it is a store of value). In coastal cities, owning a $1M house is more similar to owning $1M of stock than it is to owning $1M of cars or computers. The real goods depreciate in value quickly, the house is expected to gain value. Buying &amp; selling the car is like buying &amp; selling another real good, whereas the trading in real estate has stock-like tax advantages. But unlike more commonly accepted forms of capital (like stocks or bonds), the appreciation of the house is supposedly natural. When its value decreases, we pity the owner, whereas we tend to see crashing stocks as an ‘expected risk’.</p><p>Housing doesn’t have to be have so much like capital, and in many places it isn’t. But in America it does: both the political left and right are attached to the idea of housing being a wealth creation strategy.</p><p>The take is: housing can’t simultaneously produce wealth, be a safe investment, and be produced in enough quantity to avert crises. That’s the punchline. We want it to be part of two exclusive categories. It can’t, and most people end up advantaging the investment characteristics over the thing-people-need-to-live-in ‘real good’ characteristics.</p><p>To solve the housing crisis, we need to make housing worse, as an investment.</p><h3 id="the-answer-to-everything-is-maybe">The answer to everything is maybe</h3><p>Reading <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/compendium/types?share_key=baf6b67369843fa2">types: a programmers compendium</a> really drives home the point that <em>most bright-line definitions in software engineering aren’t real.</em> What a ‘strong type system’ <em>is</em> is really poorly defined. Same with a lot of concepts – things like ‘functional programming’ are more styles than they are categories.</p><p>Even ideas about performance aren’t really… real. Many languages have different implementations of, say, sorting, depending on data types and list lengths: saying “sorting is O(n log n)” is really a gamble.</p><p>Is HTML a programming language? The answer is <em>sort of</em>? You can do logic in it, like you can do logic in almost every system: CSS is a programming language. Calling one ‘markup’ and the other…&nbsp;the <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/10/03/considering-css.html">only mainstream example of its rather peculiar family</a> doesn’t really help anyone understand anything.</p><h3 id="its-hard-to-find-simple-technology">It’s hard to find simple technology</h3><p>I think my biggest disappointment with Rust is that it isn’t simple. It can <em>create</em> simple programs: with the right compiler flags, it’ll produce very small executables with minimal fluff, but the language itself is dramatically complex. The compiler is huge and fiendish. Language features are numerous and subtle.</p><p>Other mainstream systems are complicated. <a href="https://v8.dev/">V8</a> is an incredible engineering accomplishment and is really, really sophisticated. Practically every language and its implementation has grown significantly.</p><p>There are kind of few reasons to worry about this complexity in the 9-5, but in my free time it has me thinking about things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC">Tiny BASIC</a>, Forth, and Scheme - though even in the case of Scheme it’s hard to find an implementation that hasn’t grown a JIT or other fancy features.</p><p>On the Rust/Go-side of things, I’ve been paying a lot of attention to <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> - I think it’s pretty neat. It isn’t a ‘big idea’ language, just a really cleanly-designed C-like language that seems fix the main problems with C. And it’s really simple: the syntax is simple and it doesn’t have many big theories. It seems like it occupies a tiny portion of the current mindshare but for little CLI tools and systems software, could be really important.</p><p>After I started writing this, the ever-interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/everestpipkin">Everest Pipkin</a> published a <a href="https://github.com/everestpipkin/tools-list">list of tiny tools</a>, which is absolutely incredible - <a href="https://github.com/everestpipkin/tools-list#fantasy-consoles">fantasy consoles</a> is chock full of simple-at-their-core systems.</p><h3 id="helping-to-avert-the-apocalypse">Helping to avert the apocalypse</h3><p>In almost every way, the world is teetering on the brink. What can you do? It’s tempting to shut off the news and just get some work done when you can focus, and admittedly that’s what I’ve been doing most of the time. But there has to be something else.</p><p>In America, obviously part of this is <a href="https://joebiden.com/">voting for Joe Biden</a>. He’s the ‘anti-apocalypse’ candidate who couldn’t do worse than his predecessor even if he tried. He wasn’t my <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/05/16/elizabeth-warren.html">first pick</a>. But we aren’t choosing favorites anymore: we’re trying to avert the apocalypse, and there is no excuse to sit it out. If you don’t vote and the apocalypse happens, I’m blaming you.</p><p>Then there are other campaigns: donating to small, competitive candidates throughout the country. The smartest way to do this, I think, is by spreading donations between races that are picked by researchers. <a href="https://idlewords.com/">Maciej Cegłowski</a> has two such efforts: <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/great_slate">The Great Slate</a> (four rural house campaigns) and <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/state_slate_2">The State Slate</a> (eleven state house campaigns). He researches &amp; interviews candidates, configures an ActBlue page to split donations amongst them, and then you donate: it’s simple. <a href="https://blueprint.swingleft.org/">Blueprint</a> is doing something similar - splitting donations between ActBlue campaigns - but has visual polish like a fin-tech company and a more DC-insider staff. Both are ways of efficiently allocating donations to useful campaigns. They’re like value-factor index funds for political change.</p><p>When you allocate resources to useful campaigns, they are often Democrats running in conservative areas, so they’re often misaligned from you in one or more ways. It sucks that my donations go to folks with wishy-washy views on immigration policy or transit: but, again, we aren’t picking favorites anymore.</p><h2 id="nostalgia-bot">Nostalgia bot</h2><p>I’ve been following <a href="https://twitter.com/everyblock">every lot dc</a> for a while and it’s the first time that a Twitter robot has really resonated.

    <p>A Youtube video from 2009 was right - the "Four Chord" song truly is built on the most popular progression of four chords, based on an analysis of over one million songs.</p>
    <p>In 2009, the musical group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I">“Axis of Awesome” demonstrated the ubiquity of the what they call the <em>“Four Chord”</em> song</a>. They assert the that most popular songs of the last 40 years use a particular and popular progression of four chords: C-G-Am-F.</p>
<p>I wanted to see just how popular this particular progression is, so I asked the question: <strong>Are the four chords mentioned by the “Axis of Awesome” (C-G-Am-F) the most represented set of four chords?</strong></p>
<p>Not only did I get the answer, but this question ended up resulting in <a href="https://schollz.github.io/chords/">a new web app to find chord progressions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-and-analyzing-song-data">Gathering and analyzing song data</h2>
<p>To gather song data to analyze, I first wrote a program that parsed guitar tabs and extracted chords. The data sample included more than one million songs from almost every genre (except for classical), including blues, jazz, pop, rock, country, folks, etc. I divided each song into sections (i.e. Verse, Chorus, Pre-chorus) and collected the names of chords contained in each section. To aid in comparison, I transposed all the chords in each section of each song so that they were in the same key, the key of C.</p>
<p>Once the data was ready, I found that I had compiled over two thousand different four-chord progressions.</p>
<p>To rank these chord progressions I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> to sample the probability distribution of
four-chord progressions. This produced a list from <em>most</em> to <em>least</em> common chord progressions.</p>
<h2 id="most-four-chord-progressions">Most four-chord progressions</h2>
<p>After analyzing the one million plus songs, I had a list of the most common four-chord progressions. Guess which chord progress topped the list at the most probable?</p>
<p>C G Am F</p>
<p>probability = 7.6%</p>
<p>Yes, Axis of Awesome <em>was</em> right! Their “Four Chord” song encompasses the most popular progression I found.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the next six most common sets of four-chord progressions are permutations on these specific four chords:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Am F C G</p>
<p>probability = 5.1%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C Am F G</p>
<p>probability = 4.4%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>F C G Am</p>
<p>probability = 2.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C F Am G</p>
<p>probability = 2.0%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>F C Am G</p>
<p>probability = 1.5%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>F G C Am</p>
<p>probability = 1.4%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>After that you start getting chord patterns that include new minor chords like <em>Em</em> and <em>Dm</em>:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>C Em Am F</p>
<p>probability = 1.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C G Dm F</p>
<p>probability = 1.3%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Dm F C G</p>
<p>probability = 1.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C Am G F</p>
<p>probability = 1.1%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Am Dm G C</p>
<p>probability = 1.1%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C Em F G</p>
<p>probability = 1.1%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>It isn’t until about 60 chord progressions later that you get progressions that have any other chords, such as <em>Bb</em>.  For example, these are the most popular two:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>C G Bb F</p>
<p>probability = 0.3%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>F C Dm Bb</p>
<p>probability = 0.3%</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Those are just some of the most popular – there are many, <em>many</em>, more progressions.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-progressions-from-millions-of-songs">Exploring progressions from millions of songs</h2>
<p>It turns out that there is evidence that what Axis of Awesome claimed in 2009 is true: The most common four-chord progression seems to be C-G-Am-F. The other most common progressions are variations on those four chords, with addition of the other minors (Dm, and Em).</p>
<p>What about the other two thousand progressions? In order to explore them I built a chord-finding app based on the analysis of those million songs: <a href="https://schollz.github.io/chords/">https://schollz.github.io/chords/</a> Use it to help build your own progressions, and think about new music to create. Sometimes I use it when making <a href="https://infinitedigits.bandcamp.com/">my music I release</a>.</p>

A Taaalk can have any number of participants, who may or may not have a Twitter handle associated with their account. Their names can be any length - and so can the title of the Taaalk itself. But a tweet needs to have 140 characters or less. So my tweet needed to dynamically generate to take all of this into account with the one rule that it <strong>must</strong> include the url. Twitter shortens urls to 23 characters in length, and I always wanted a blank space before the url, so all the info in the tweet had to be 116 characters or less.</p></div><div><p>I built a function in my tlks_controller (this is a Rails application) which generated my Tweet, taking all the above into account:</p></div><div><div><pre>def tweet

        <p>In her new book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Harvard Business School’s Shoshana Zuboff argues Google and Facebook collect so much personal data for profit, that they’re changing the fundamentals of our economy and way of life. And now these companies are learning to shape our behavior to better serve their business goals. Shoshana joins Manoush Zomorodi to explain what this all means for us.</p>
        <p>We then explore whether or not it’s time to end our relationship with corporate spies. OG advice columnist Dear Abby gives us some tips to start with. We chat with philosopher S. Matthew Liao. <strong>He asks if we have a moral duty to quit Facebook.</strong> And journalist Nithin Coca tells us what it was like for him to quit both Facebook and Google. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t easy, but he has no regrets.</p>

  <blockquote>
<p>TL;DR - These are my notes for a potential computer hobbyist personal computer architecture. Someone called it "Minix for motherboards".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This roughly describes an architecture of off the shelf microcontroller components that can be used to create a basic standalone PC, somewhere in the neighborhood of performance of an old 286/386 DOS style PC.</p>
<p>If I build this, it will almost certainly be done in Rust. I do hope to specify the protocol/operational semantics well enough that you could create a component that was written in Micro/Circuit Python, C/C++, Ada, or maybe even as an embedded linux PC.</p>
<p>I currently am working on other projects, but I feel like this would be a fun project to stream, or maybe even write a book about learning embedded systems, or learning Rust with embedded systems?</p>
<p><strong>If you'd be interested in taking a class building/using a system like this, or would be interested in seeing this happen, <a href="mailto:james.munns@ferrous-systems.com">send me a message</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to design a PC-ish architecture that makes it easy for people learning embedded systems to build a single component. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making the system resistant to failure of a single component</li>
<li>Use only protocols/components that can be easily purchased</li>
<li>Be adaptive to allow for variety of components used</li>
<li>Value simplicity over performance</li>
<li>Make the steps to initial success very short</li>
<li>Make this fun for me and other collaborators to work on</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="project-anti-goals">Project Anti-Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Designing something that is wholly useful in commercial deployments</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="interesting-ideas">Interesting Ideas</h2>
<p>These are ideas that I think will help make the project successful.</p>
<h3 id="every-component-is-a-microcontroller-any-microcontroller">Every Component is a Microcontroller - Any Microcontroller.</h3>
<p>The idea is to have every part (or <strong>Component</strong>) of the system be its own standalone microcontroller system. Honestly, this is how most computers work today anyway, but the idea is to be able to use almost any microcontroller, from 8051, to Arm Cortex-M, to RISC-V parts, for any piece of the PC. At some point, I can see people even making parts of the PC out of FPGAs as well.</p>
<p>This includes all of the following PC parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Main CPU/Processor</li>
<li>An input controller (Keyboard/Mouse/Touch)</li>
<li>A network interface (Ethernet/Wi-Fi/LPWAN)</li>
<li>A storage controller (SSD/SD/HDD/RAMFS/USB)</li>
<li>A Sound Card</li>
<li>A graphics card (framebuffer, shaders)</li>
</ul>
<p>The system should use a protocol that almost every device has support for, and is forgiving. For that reason, I plan to use SPI for system communication.</p>
<h3 id="the-bus-protocol-spi-but-weird">The Bus Protocol - SPI, but weird.</h3>
<p>So, SPI is a simple, fast, and reliable protocol, but the trick is that it is WAY easier to write a SPI Controller, rather than a SPI peripheral. Since I want things to be simplest for the people writing the Components, they should be the SPI Controllers. But this leaves us with a problem, how do we make a PC with N SPI Controllers work with a single SPI peripheral? Here is where it gets weird.</p>
<ol>
<li>Every Component is a SPI Controller, with SCK, COPI, and CIPO pins wired to a central <strong>Arbitrator</strong>.</li>
<li>Every Component also has two GPIOs:
<ul>
<li>An output that is a "Request" line. This signals to the Arbitrator that the Component would like to talk</li>
<li>An input that is a "Go-Ahead" line. This signals to the Component to begin talking to the Arbitrator</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this system, the Arbitrator will either support being a SPI Peripheral for a lot of lines, or will handle MUXing the SCK/COPI/CIPO pins as necessary.
The Arbitrator will decide which component it wants to talk to, and for how long.
When a Component pulls its Request line low, the arbitrator will eventually acknowledge this by pulling the Component's Go-Ahead line low.
The Component can begin clocking SPI data at whatever speed it feels like, up to the maximum speed supported by the Arbitrator.
When the Component is done sending/receiving data, it checks whether the Go-Ahead line is still low.
If so, then the message was "accepted" by the arbitrator.
If the Go-Ahead line is released high before the Component releases the Request line, this means that the arbitrator has "hung up" on the Component, meaning either an error or timeout has occurred.</p>
<h3 id="the-arbitrator-basically-a-northbridge-chip">The Arbitrator - Basically a Northbridge chip</h3>
<p>The Arbitrator has two primary tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arbitrating the Bus Protocol as described above, servicing and discovering components that have been connected</li>
<li>Managing memory allocations used to communicate between devices</li>
</ol>
<p>I've already described the lowest level of the protocol above - we'll use an awkward SPI communication. However I haven't described how the higher protocol layers work.</p>
<p>All devices will communicate through a mailbox system.
The arbitrator will take data from the Components, and place them in an in-memory object store.
Each created item will be assigned a UUID, which will be returned to the Component on creation.
This UUID can then be placed in a mailbox to another component, sending access to the data to that component.
Each item is read-only.</p>
<p>Example (psuedocode):</p>
<pre><span>// A binary RPC messages are sent from Component to the Arbitrator
// The format will probably be binary, but maybe with an alternative
// command to use the following REPL format?
//
// Components are also assigned a UUID on boot. This Component has
// the own-address of 9ea8b6a7-2967-4db8-98b8-d4577548ed04.

// Data can be stored to the Arbitrator memory space. Data can then be
// referenced as inter-device storage using UUIDs as a reference. Data
// is allocated on a FIFO basis, with oldest memory items becoming
// dropped.
//
// The arbitrator may choose to limit the rate, maximum size or other
// parameters of creating memory items based on configuration.
CREATE(
    // number of bytes to write, can be set to zero for dynamic
    // length using something like COBS or when the Request
    // line is de-asserted
    13,

    // The payload of the data
    "Hello, world!",

    // No UUID provided to send to another component, just return
    // the newly created UUID. If provided, this would place
    // the created UUID into the mailbox of another component
    None,
)
// The following UUID is returned to the Component on success
-&gt; Result&lt;3b2fd5d1-ae16-46af-afc1-f60241d0a5b6, CreateError&gt;

// You can send data by reference to another component you know's

// are a FIFO queue of UUIDs that can be loaded by that Component
SEND_MAILBOX(
    // The data reference to send

This set off a week of unprecedented trading activity in the company's stock (KODK).</p><p>At around 12pm on Monday, the following was tweeted and deleted some time later:</p><p>"BIG announcement expected tomorrow from Kodak and the U.S. government regarding "a new manufacturing initiative."

A Redditor picked up on the story later that afternoon, posting it to r/pennystocks and retweeting the details:</p><p><img src="https://www.chartfleau.com/kodak/twitter_retweet.jpg" alt=""></p><p>This also appears to have moved the stock, as we see another $500k invested in about 30 minutes after the post, and the price climbing to +22% on the day.</p><h2>Monday, July 27 - Leaks, Price and Notional Volume of KODK Stock</h2><p>Compared with the next couple days, Monday's activity is pretty much invisible. While the $4 million traded on Monday is a lot for KODK, the next day we see $2 billion flood into the company ahead of the official announcement at the end of day.</p><h2>$2 Billion Trades Before the Official Announcement</h2><p>Following the announcement that the government would provide Kodak with a $765M loan to manufacture drug ingredients, at Wednesday's open KODK was up almost 900% on the week.</p><p>Robinhood account data shows retail interest rising on Tuesday, although Robinhood accounts for a small portion of overall trading activity. About 20,000 Robinhood accounts added KODK on Tuesday, while the stock was traded 867,308 times according to market-wide data reported by IEX, with more than 10,000 trades per minute during peak activity.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Starting September 1st, I'm shutting down the user-facing portion of <a href="https://invidio.us/">https://invidio.us</a> and stepping away from development. If you have an account on the site, you can export your data <a href="https://invidio.us/data_control">here</a>, which will allow you to import everything to <a href="https://instances.invidio.us/">another instance</a> or self-host.</p>
<p>The API will continue to function until October 1st, to give time for any services relying on it to migrate to other solutions. If you're a patron on Liberapay, I would urge you to switch your donation to <a href="https://liberapay.org/iv-org">iv-org</a>, as that will ensure it goes to the stewards of the project going forward.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the time of this writing, the main Invidious instance has roughly 35,000 users. It's difficult for me to even begin to think of those as actual people, and not just a number. At that level, the amount of feedback I receive, which I would consider rather small in comparison to others I've seen, is overwhelming. It's demoralizing not being able to respond to all of it properly. Even more so when I've received something that deserves an involved response, but I haven't had the time to reply, which counter-intuitively means the best comments are least likely to receive any response. To echo <a href="http://antirez.com/news/129">antirez</a>: it's crushing not being able to be "there" for people.</p>
<p>Lately, I've felt myself withdraw much more in return. For any project though, especially something that requires maintanence, it's difficult to actually "unplug" and mentally recharge. Turning off notifications has helped, but it's definitely taken its toll.</p>
<p>For any project of a certain size, it's more important for the lead to be a manager more than a developer. As an example, it's mostly well-known that Linus Torvalds <a href="https://youtu.be/H8Gd9t7FQqI?t=525">hardly does any coding anymore</a>. At that point working on a side-project becomes a job, and not one I particularly enjoy. If I had known that I would've ended up in that position on a passion project, I'm curious if I would have made it open-source, or started working on it at all.</p>
<p>In either case, I consider myself extremely lucky to have people that can manage the project in future, and can only imagine what it would be like for someone without that luxury. I can't help shake the feeling that somewhere, the software I use is being developed solely by volunteers who would rather quit, but don't have the ability to say "no". This post has been delayed for that very reason, especially when so many people have given so much, and I feel they deserve a proper goodbye. At this point though, I can't find the strength to leave on better terms.</p>
<p>I don't want this to read like I somehow feel underappreciated or underpaid. I'm not motivated by praise or money. After working on the same thing for three years, I'm just tired and ready to move on.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        <div>
            <p>I bought a couple EdgeStar AP14001HS portable air conditioners in April 2020, since I expect to spend most of the Summer at home.  I'm not able to use window A/Cs here, though that would be the obvious choice for efficiency because all the hot parts remain outside.</p>
<h3>Similar models</h3>
<p>From looking at Internet photos, these A/Cs appear to follow the same general desgin:</p>
<ul>
<li>EdgeStar AP14001HS</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-14S</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-14SH</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-141BG</li>
<li>Whynter ARC-143MX</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't say to what extent they are identical, but the stuff on this page <em>might</em> apply to all of them.</p>
<h3>Air Gaps</h3>
<p>I wanted a dual-hose air conditioner because single-hose models are thermodynamically suboptimal.  Blowing hot air out the window creates negative pressure in the room, which sucks outdoor air back inside through various cracks.  In theory, dual-hose models avoid this problem by cooling the condenser with outdoor air, which is then re-exhausted.</p>
<p>However, when I feel the intake and exhaust hoses on the AP14001HS, the volume of air moving through the intake is considerably smaller, so air must be leaking from the room into the condenser compartment, and also between the room and outside while the blower is off.  There are two major locations where this happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where the bottom meets the front:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/bottom_gap.jpg" alt="bottom gap"></p>
<p>I sealed this one using tape:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/bottom_gap_taped.jpg" alt="bottom gap taped"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the back, below the air filter:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/filter_gap.gif" alt="filter gap"></p>
<p>To block this one, I cut a <strong>436mm x 98mm</strong> rectangle from a sheet of 1/16" (1.5mm) ABS plastic.  A cereal box also works for prototyping purposes... in general, the material needs to be pretty thin, but rigid enough to keep itself flat.</p>
<p>The plastic gets pulled toward the rear while the compressor is running, and toward the front otherwise, so a piece of tape can help hold it in place.</p>
<p>Finally, if you decide to open the unit (a 12-inch #2 Philips screwdriver is helpful), it's possible to tape over some internal hose/wiring gaps, but I'm not sure how important these are.</p>
<h3>Am I going to fry this thing?</h3>
<p>These modifications are intended to make the condenser compartment run hotter, which may shorten the life of some components, but I have no idea which ones or by how much.  I at least have a couple bits of evidence that this might not be a terrible idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>I asked EdgeStar support about sealing the bottom gap:</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Me]</strong></p>
<p>I recently purchased a couple EdgeStar AP14001HS dual-hose air
conditioners, and noticed that the intake hose moves quite a bit less
air than the exhaust hose. It seems that the extra air is "leaking"
into the condenser compartment where the bottom meets the front of the
unit. See the attached photo, where I temporarily covered the gap
with masking tape. Are you able to tell me whether this gap serves a
necessary function? Otherwise, I would rather leave it covered,
because I chose a dual-hose model to keep the inside/outside air
isolated from each other.</p>
<p><strong>[EdgeStar Guy]</strong></p>
<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting EdgeStar support.</p>
<p>The area that you've taped up is considered an overflow release.
You are perfectly welcome to keep that area taped up though as it
shouldn't cause an issue.  My engineers have informed me that it's
OK to do this.</p>
<p><strong>[Me]</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.  I had suspected that the gap was to prevent the unit from
filling with water, though it seems bigger than necessary.</p>
<p>The AP14001HS specs say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooling Capacity (ASHRAE) 14000 BTU</li>
<li>Cooling Capacity (SACC) 8600 BTU (38% lower)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to this article, "infiltration air" is a major factor in
the SACC measurement:
<a href="https://support.edgestar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005480926-What-is-SACC-Seasonally-Adjusted-Cooling-Capacity">https://support.edgestar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005480926-What-is-SACC-Seasonally-Adjusted-Cooling-Capacity</a>-</p>
<p>Have your engineers evaluated what effect sealing this gap (and other
intake leaks) has on cooling efficiency?</p>
<p><strong>[EdgeStar Guy]</strong></p>
<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to me.</p>
<p>I wasn't able to get an answer for this from my engineers about the
effect on sealing the gap will have on efficiency.  They did say that
when the units are tested, they are tested with this gap to produce that
SACC rating.  There's no modifications to the units done while testing.
The efficiency of the units includes the air gap.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like there has been factory level testing with the gap
sealed, but the engineers who work on these units have performed their
own tests and found covering this gap to not be an issue.
They weren't able to give me additional information on the SACC though
as it's not something we can test at this location.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>Someone on <a href="https://www.rollitup.org/t/modifying-portable-a-c-for-use-in-sealed-grow-room-w-co2-tutorial-w-pix.887831/">a plant-growing forum</a> reported sealing a Whynter ARC-143MX tightly enough to maintain a high-CO2 atmosphere.  It's not clear for what duration it actually ran, but the thread spans 4 years and the author doesn't mention a failure.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I wouldn't say that there's no risk of damage, but at least it's been tried before.</p>
<p>After sealing these gaps, I could feel more air moving through the intake port, and less air coming from the exhaust when I briefly obstruct the intake.</p>
<h3>Stand back, I'm going to try science</h3>
<p>In order to test these modifications, I installed the air conditioner in a somewhat-sealed closet with a 1.5m² volume.  I initialized the temperature to roughly 72°F, set the A/C to 61°F (the minimum value), and let it run for about 3 minutes until the blower shut off.</p>
<p>This was repeated 3 times in the factory configuration (red lines), 3 times with the gaps sealed (blue lines), and finally 2 times in "single hose mode" (black lines) with the intake sucking directly from the closet space.  I logged the temperature using a phone pointed at a thermometer, running Open Camera on 10-second repeat:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/ap14001hs_open_sealed_graph.png" alt="open/sealed graph"></p>
<p>I don't think my setup is rigorous enough to calculate any absolute efficiency numbers, but clearly the sealed configuration does a better job of cooling, and single-hose mode is abysmal.</p>
<h3>Rant</h3>
<p>I find it disgraceful that the portable A/C companies are so clueless about efficiency that improvements can be made using basic household supplies.  This reminds me of the computer PSU industry before 80 Plus, where everything is garbage and nobody knows what to buy.  Why is all the innovation focused on single-hose designs?</p>
<p>Places like the Bay Area are full of apartments and condos that are gradually becoming unlivable as temperatures rise, so it would be nice if people could just throw money at a decent product.</p>
<p>It's possible that <a href="http://www.climax-air.com/">http://www.climax-air.com/</a> knows what they're doing, since they make (as far as I know in 2020) the only dual-hose portable with a variable-speed compressor.  But I've only looked at the website, since their supply is very limited.  Maybe I'll check again when the EdgeStars wear out.</p>
<h3>Photos of the closet setup</h3>
<p>(The second AP14001HS visible in the mirror was used to set the room temperature.)</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/closet1.jpg" alt="closet experiment 1">
<img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/closet2.jpg" alt="closet experiment 2"></p>
<h3>Building-related Notes</h3>
<p>Each unit consumes about 10.5 amps, so it's important to map out which circuit breakers feed which outlets, and avoid sharing a circuit with a high-drain appliance like a microwave or electric kettle.  Ideally, they should also sit on opposite legs of the main breaker.  So far, I've had no issues sharing a 15 amp circuit with a refrigerator or computer.</p>
<p>On a day that peaks around 95°F, two A/Cs running continuously can keep 850 sqft in the mid-70s.  My IR thermometer says the ceiling is considerably warmer than the walls, so it would probably be useful to improve the attic insulation.</p>
<p>I plan to run these in "heat" mode during the winter, which should consume less energy than the resistive baseboard heaters, but time will tell how well that works.</p>
<p>One caveat to this installation is that my windows are locked/taped into position, so I can't open them at night when the air is cooler outside.  It would be nice to have an automatic "ventilate" mode for this purpose.  However, an A/C cooled with cool air produces even colder air, so it doesn't need to spend much time running in this state.</p>
<h3>Simpler Hacks</h3>
<p>This unit blows indoor air mostly upwards.  I opened the case to remove the built-in deflector, and put a Frost King HD9 in its place. This creates a roughly-horizontal air stream, and also seems slightly quieter without those extra fins in the way.</p>
<p>(In this photo, note that I taped over the LEDs to reduce brightness, and the chunk of foam was from an abandoned soundproofing experiment involving repositionable adhesive.)</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/deflector.jpg" alt="deflector"></p>
<p>The hoses may be insulated using a 6 inch "tubular cotton stockinette bandage".  After 5 minutes of runtime with 2 layers of cotton, I measured 122°F at the hose and 102°F at the cotton surface.  This isn't the greatest insulating material, but it's cheap, easy, and looks reasonable enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/stockinette.jpg" alt="stockinette"></p>
<p>You can rip open a standard furnace air filter, and cut the zig-zag part to fit the air intake's plastic frame.  Note that this will restrict airflow, so it probably makes sense to run the blower on high.  I increased the density a bit after taking this photo:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/air_filter.jpg" alt="air filter"></p>
<h3>Soundproofing</h3>
<p>To make the unit run quieter, I started by wrapping it with a blanket, held in place using tape.  The hoses prevent anything from obstructing the room air intake.  Here is my "A/C burrito" prototype:</p>
<p><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/burrito_prototype.jpg" alt="burrito prototype"></p>
<p>With the unit running for hours when it's 90°F outside, the hottest point under the blanket is around 94°F, so it seems to do a reasonable job of keeping itself cool.</p>
<hr>
<p>For the improved version, I used mass loaded vinyl (MLV) wrapped in cotton blanket with velcro strips, held together using staples.</p>
<p>The cost of materials (for two copies) was roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>4ft x 12.5ft roll of 1 pound/sqft MLV: $110</li>
<li>Two twin-size (66 x 90 inch) cotton blankets: $50</li>
<li>A few yards of 2 inch velcro: $10</li>
<li>Staples with 9/16 inch legs (Bostitch BTHT73533): $4</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the dimensions I used:</p>
<p><a href="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/mlv_burrito_dimensions.png"><img src="https://pmarks.net/ac/assets/mlv_burrito_dimensions.png" alt="mlv_burrito dimensions"></a></p>
<p>I cut the MLV to size using a tape measure, square, pencil, and scissors.  Removing the bottom corners leaves room for the power cord.  The wings have different lengths because the power cord is off-center.</p>
<p>There are velcro strips along the top (with opposing velcro hot-glued to the A/C), and on the back so the burrito can attach to itself.</p>
<p>Photos of the MLV burrito:</p>

In the software world, a dependency could mean many different things, but
for this article, when I say dependency, I’m talking about a software package you install
using package managers such as <em>npm</em> or <em>pip</em>.</p><p>In many software ecosystems, dependencies exist in almost every project. In the Python world,
<code>pip install</code> makes it very easy to add a dependency to your project and get functionality
for free. Python’s package ecosystem contains plenty of high quality, well maintained dependencies,
but it also includes a lot of abandoned and lower quality ones. Adding new dependencies
to a project affects its maintainability. For example, a new version of Python is released,
and you want to upgrade your project. However, a dependency that you added a few months ago
doesn’t support the new version. Now you must choose to drop the dependency or wait for it
to support the new version and refrain from upgrading your project.</p><p>I frequently run into this scenario a lot professionally. Developers, including myself, too readily
add dependencies without considering the long term consequences to a project.
This article walks through how to properly vet a dependency before including it in your
project. I speak specifically about Python, but these lessons apply to any language or
software ecosystem.</p><h2 id="dependency-check-list">Dependency Check List</h2><ul><li>Popularity<ul><li>How many stars on GitHub?</li><li>How many downloads per month?</li></ul></li><li>Update Frequency<ul><li>What is the release cadence?</li><li>How quickly are issues resolved and are they tracked in the release notes?</li></ul></li><li>Financial Backing<ul><li>Does the project have funding?</li><li>Is the dependency backed by a legal entity?</li></ul></li><li>Manpower<ul><li>How many contributors does the project have?</li><li>Does the project have a governance structure or a core team?</li></ul></li><li>Licensing<ul><li>Is the license open source friendly?</li><li>Does the license allow forks?</li></ul></li><li>Complexity<ul><li>Could you implement the dependency yourself?</li><li>Could you maintain a fork of the dependency if it’s abandoned?</li></ul></li><li>Code Quality<ul><li>Does it have adequate test coverage and do the tests pass?</li><li>How many dependencies does it have and what are the quality of those dependencies?</li></ul></li><li>Documentation<ul><li>Does the project have comprehensive documentation?</li><li>Is the documentation kept up to date with the code?</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="checklist-explanation">Checklist Explanation</h3><h4 id="popularity">Popularity</h4><p>Popularity indicates whether or not the dependency is worth adopting. Downloads per
month and GitHub stars aren’t necessarily the best indicators of popularity, but these metrics
are easy to find and good enough. Including a dependency that does not have
a large adoption and following can be risky and should be done with care.</p><h4 id="update-frequency">Update Frequency</h4><p>Update frequency shows us whether or not a dependency is actively maintained. A dependency
does not necessarily need to release updates frequently to indicate quality. Some dependencies
don’t require frequent release because they’re mature and stable, but look for quick high
priority bug fixes to indicate quality.</p><h4 id="financial-backing">Financial Backing</h4><p>In the open source world, financial backing is a nice to have, not a must have. Some dependencies
grow so popular that they receive financing. Financing tends to indicate quality, but the
lack of financing is not a deal breaker.</p><h4 id="manpower">Manpower</h4><p>Frequently, you’ll find a dependency maintained by a single core contributor. If that core
contributor decides to abandon the dependency or lacks the time to maintain it, you now
face a tough choice of dropping the dependency, keeping the dependency without maintenance,
or maintaining it yourself. In some cases, another person forks and performs maintenance,
but you shouldn’t count on that.</p><h4 id="licensing">Licensing</h4><p>Often, licensing gets overlooked, but an open source approved license is important. If the
dependency does not have an open source approved license, then people might not be able to
fork it and maintain it. Additionally, being able to view the code itself gives you
insight into whether or not to implement it yourself.</p><h4 id="complexity">Complexity</h4><p>I see developers include new dependencies that don’t add a lot of functionality or new
dependencies that could be replicated easily. Dependencies are burdens and should only be
added if they truly save the developer time and effort.</p><h4 id="code-quality">Code Quality</h4><p>Code quality can be measured in numerous different ways, but for the purpose of this checklist,
we care about the dependency working as intended and not getting ourselves into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dependency hell</a>.
Testing indicates whether the dependency works as intended and using the checklist to vet
sub-dependencies helps prevent dependency hell.</p><h4 id="documentation">Documentation</h4><p>Quality documentation can be more important than the code itself. Well written documentation
makes adopting a new dependency much easier and indicates the dependency’s
quality. As a dependency grows, the documentation tends to drift out of sync with the code itself.
Ensuring the documentation stays up to date with the code helps indicate the quality of
the dependency.</p><h2 id="example-dependencies">Example Dependencies</h2><p>Let’s use actual Python dependencies to walk through an evaluation using the
checklist. We’ll use a simple rating scheme of positive, neutral, and negative with our
checklist.</p><h3 id="django">Django</h3><p>Django is a Python web framework that takes a batteries-included approach to building a
database-backed HTTP web service.</p><ul><li>How many stars on GitHub?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django has over
<a href="https://github.com/django/django" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50,0000</a> stars as of this writing which is a lot.
Are GitHub stars the best measure of popularity? No, but they provide a good enough and easy
to find measure.</p><ul><li>How many downloads per month?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django had over
<a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/django" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5,000,000</a> downloads the month
previous to this writing. This shows me a lot of people use this dependency, and I can be confident
adopting it.</p><ul><li>What is the release cadence?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django has a formal
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release process</a>
which follows semantic versioning and provides long term support releases. Django releases
bug fixes

alpha releases of upcoming versions.</p><ul><li>How quickly are issues resolved and are they tracked in the release notes?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django has its own
<a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue tracker</a> and, generally,
high priority bugs get resolved quickly. Django also has its own
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security policy</a> to ensure
sensitive, security related bugs won’t get disclosed publicly before a fix.</p><ul><li>Does the project have funding?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django receives
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding</a> from many
different sources including companies such as JetBrains, Sentry, and Rackspace.</p><ul><li>Is the dependency backed by a legal entity?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>An

positive because I don’t think I could implement Django. The positive
rating signifies that using the dependency would save me a lot of time and effort implementing
the functionality on my own.</p><ul><li>Could you maintain a fork of the dependency if it’s abandoned?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>negative</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Again, Django is a large, complex project. I rated this negatively because if Django is
abandoned I doubt that I could maintain a fork of it. Maintaining a fork would be time
consuming. Even though Django is unlikely to be abandoned, I rate this negatively,
because if Django is abandoned, that negatively impacts the maintainability of my project.</p><ul><li>Does it have adequate test coverage and do the tests pass?<ul><li>Rating: <strong>positive</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>Django has a

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout-marketing"><section><div> <p><i>by</i> <span>Joe Marshall</span> <i>on</i> <span>July 26th, 2020</span></p> <p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/atlas-header.png"></p></div> <div><h2 id="intro-to-stripe-atlas">Intro to Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas is a <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">“platform for forming a company”</a> aimed in particular at startups and internet businesses. It consolidates a lot of the legal paperwork, fees, and hassle of incorporating a business, giving you access to a bevy of Stripe resources for company formation, all behind an online dashboard that sits inside your usual Stripe account. It costs $500 and covers a few hundred dollars in legal fees, plus it comes with thousands of dollars in credits with affiliated partners.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe Atlas offers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof your company is incorporated - papers, Tax ID, etc  </li>
<li>Stripe account  </li>
<li>Business checking account with Azlo Banking (optional, more on this later)  </li>
<li>Access to the Stripe Atlas community  </li>
<li>A year of registered agent fees (required for Delaware Corps, normally $100/year)</li>
<li>Off-the-shelf legal templates created by Stripe Atlas-affiliated lawyers</li>
<li>Special offers from vendors ($5,000 in AWS credits, $10,000 in Digital Ocean, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Stripe Atlas was designed initially for businesses that wanted to incorporate as Delaware C Corporations, it’s been expanded to support LLCs - meaning that if you don’t want to issue stock, have a Board of Directors, etc, but just want the legal framework for some shared profit venture, with the liability protection of an LLC, Stripe Atlas is still for you.</p>
<p>A major feature of Atlas, finally, is that it optionally comes with a business bank account. Access to the US banking system is a killer feature for international entrepreneurs who might want to process payments, sell / purchase companies, or otherwise participate in the American market.</p>
<p><strong>So, Stripe Atlas is for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entrepreneurs who want to simplify the incorporation process  </li>
<li>Startup Founders  </li>
<li>Bootstrappers / Indiehackers / Side Project-ers  </li>
<li>International Entrepreneurs who want to do business in the US</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-we-chose-stripe-atlas">Why <em>We</em> Chose Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>We’re a <a href="https://formcake.com/about">small, four-person bootstrapped business</a> (basically, bullet points one and three). We knew and trusted Stripe as our payment processor and loved the idea of not only consolidating a lengthy, involved process into a tool we (already!) used, we also saw the $500 fee as more than worth it, considering the promised $5,000 in AWS credits, registered agent fees, and incorporation fee. The ability to create a business bank account in addition to the incorporation was gravy, considering that we needed a business-only Stripe-connected account. For us, since all we required was a garden-variety, digitally-oriented LLC formation with the ultimate company divided into four ownership units, Atlas made perfect sense. If our needs hadn’t been so simple and we’d ultimately needed something more custom, we still would’ve explored Stripe Atlas’ premade templates and flat-fee legal services, but more cautiously.</p>
<h2 id="approval-process">Approval Process</h2>
<p>In order to get approved for a Stripe Atlas account and a Delaware C Corporation, you’ll need to provide some information to Stripe for <em>each person</em> who’s going to be a part owner of the company:</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo of your driver’s license</li>
<li>Driver’s license number</li>
<li>Driver’s license expiration</li>
<li>Physical address</li>
<li>Social security number</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you submit this info Stripe will hit you with a whole mess of emails asking you to Docusign everything from an IP Assignment, which assigns any intellectual property you might have created to the company, to the actual paperwork dividing stock if you’re a Delaware C Corp or ownership units if you’re an LLC. It’s all very direct and automated, signing each stage of documents and providing the requisite information unlocks the next stage of documents and info-gathering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong>: We signed up and submitted all our personal info<br><strong>Day 3</strong>: A mistake! We noticed in our Stripe Atlas dashboard that the status of our documents was no longer "Submitted." We notified them, resubmitted some things, and they rectified the error.<br><strong>Day 6</strong>: We receive the company formation documents: IP assignment, ownership percentages, etc.<br><strong>Day 10</strong>: We received our bank account with Azlo but still couldn’t accept payment (trying to process one would trigger an error through the Stripe API)<br><strong>Day 14</strong>: We receive our EIN (Employer Identification Number), otherwise known as our tax ID. We can now accept payments!</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-aws-credits">Stripe Atlas AWS Credits</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas teases a number of partner benefits in their promotional copy - $5,000 for AWS, up to $100,000 for GCP (!). Of course our all-AWS infrastructure makes those AWS credits essentially free money, so we were very interested in maximizing that benefit.</p>
<p>So after signing up for Atlas and going through all the AWS rigamarole we were able to secure only $1,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">posted about it</a> and actually received a follow up from Stripe:</p>
<section>
Hi David, 

<p>Thanks for your interest in Stripe Atlas. My name is Tony and I’ll be happy to share further about our tools.</p>
<p>We know that building a new business is exciting and challenging—but it can also be costly. To help you get off to a great start, Stripe Atlas has partnered with Amazon Web Services to create some great offers for Stripe Atlas businesses.</p>
<p>In your case, applying through Stripe Atlas, the amount you're eligible for is (up to) $5000. The "up to" phrase is because there is a lifetime eligibility cap.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about AWS benefits or Stripe Atlas, just reply to this email—we're happy to help.       </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Tony</p>
</section>

<p>In summary: It seems that though Stripe can advertise the "up to" amounts it’s the actual partners (like AWS) who are setting the standards for what companies merit what credit payouts. Basically, Stripe directs you to AWS, you verify you’re a Stripe customer via a code, and the Amazon Gods pay what they pay.</p>
<p>It seems in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> (the program giving the credits) we signed up under the "Bootstrapped / Self-funded" option to get our $1,000 in credits. Maybe if we'd signed up as a "Funded" startup we could've expected the full $5,000?</p>
<p>It’s disappointing and a little opaque, but no more than most marketing copy. Just keep in mind as you’re reading those credit totals in the official Stripe Atlas documentation that they come with light asterisks - it’s not ultimately Stripe awarding those amounts.</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-taxes">Stripe Atlas Taxes</h2>
<p>We have been incorporated for under a fiscal year, so alas we haven’t had the pleasure of doing taxes yet. We have done some research into it though, and tried to get a sense of what support Stripe offers Atlas companies during tax time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of some of the Stripe communication around taxes. These resources all came in an email to Atlas founders:</p>
<section>
Taxes &amp; Legal <br>
- Tax season ends July 15. <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/official-stripe-atlas-2020-tax-thread/11361">Get answers to your questions.</a><br>
- <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/guidance-on-extension-of-time-to-file-w-irs-c-corp-no-revenue/13511">“I’m looking for guidance on how to apply for an extension with the IRS.”</a><br>
- <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/should-i-pay-taxes-again/13738">“I paid taxes four months ago. I just got an email saying I have to pay again.”</a>
</section>

<h2 id="azlo-banking-option">Azlo Banking Option</h2>
<p>We decided to create a business checking account with Azlo because we desperately needed to move off my-real-live-checking-account we naturally shipped with.</p>
<p>We haven’t done anything exciting from a financial perspective - no complicated M&amp;A’s, accounting logistics, or large business loans - we’ve just been depositing money from our Stripe account and occasionally withdrawing.</p>
<p>One neat feature of using Azlo + Atlas is that when you’re activating your Stripe account, moving beyond the testing stage and generating a live production token, as soon as Stripe gives you a valid token you’re ready to accept payments - immediately. It’s a great feeling adding that critical Stripe token to your secrets management, pushing it live, and knowing someone can “walk up”, purchase your digital product, and pay you money for it, all completely automated. This is admittedly a small thing but also indicative of some of that Stripe attention to detail they’re so great about.</p>
<h2 id="our-conclusion">Our Conclusion</h2>
<p>Really the only blemish on our entire Stripe Atlas experience was wanting that sweet $5,000 in AWS credits but settling for $1,000 - which feels like a pretty small, spoiled gripe. Having the central location for everything company incorporation-related in our Stripe dashboard - where we’re already comfortable - and small things like document and personal info checklists, only having to pay a single entity (Stripe) instead of a million small fees, along with just having the whole thing on rails, makes Atlas a great proposition.</p>
<h2 id="other-stripe-resources">Other Stripe Resources</h2>
<p>Here are a few resources we’ve found useful. They run the gamut from the official sources for some of the technologies we’ve mentioned to particularly good community discussions around common issues.</p>

manage a fleet of Linux servers with Puppet. And in my spare time, I'd like to
manage the servers I run with Ansible or Puppet in the future.</p>
<p>Virtual Machines are easily obtained nowadays. Cloud providers such as Digital
Ocean or Exoscale offer virtual machines with various operating systems at
rather moderate prices. You only have to pay for the time the virtual machines
are actually running, so you can save money by shutting those hosts down when
not needed.</p>
<p>However, running those virtual machines locally costs even less. No additional
public IPv4 addresses are wasted, and, most importantly, a local setup allows
you to test changes to be applied to your productive environment locally
beforehand.</p>

<code>node2</code>, which later could be used for a Puppet setup with a Puppetmaster ‒

Dell Latitude E6430 from 2013 with 8 GB or RAM, which is just laying around
here. (This also proofs that you don't need a whole lot of hardware resources
for such a setup.)</p>

<p>Given a fresh Debian setup with the lightweight LXQt desktop, a couple of
packages need to be installed in order to get virtualization to work:</p>
<pre><code># apt-get install \
    qemu-kvm \
    libvirt-clients \
    libvirt-daemon-system \
    virtinst \
    bridge-utils
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to activate virtualization in the BIOS. Check if the <code>kvm</code> kernel
module is activated:</p>
<pre><code>$ lsmod | grep ^kvm
kvm                 835584  1 kvm_intel
</code></pre>
<p>If there is a number not equal to 0 in the third column, <code>kvm</code> is up and
running.</p>

<p>Usually a <code>default</code> network is pre-defined, which can be checked as follows:</p>
<pre><code># virsh net-list --all
 Name      State      Autostart   Persistent
----------------------------------------------
 default   inactive   no          yes
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>default</code> network can be configured to be started up automatically:</p>
<pre><code># virsh net-autostart default
Network default marked as autostarted
</code></pre>
<p>Until the next system restart, it is started up manually:</p>
<pre><code># virsh net-start default
Network default started
</code></pre>
<p>A bridge interface <code>virbr0</code> should have been created:</p>
<pre><code># brctl show
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
virbr0          8000.5254005f4e6b       yes             virbr0-nic
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that NAT is activated:</p>
<pre><code># sudo sysctl -a | grep 'net.ipv4.ip_forward ='
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
</code></pre>
<p>The value of the above property must be <code>1</code>.</p>
<h2>Possible Issues</h2>
<p>If <code>iptables</code> is in use, make sure to forward the traffic from the guests over
the bridge <code>virbr0</code>, so that the guests also have internet access:</p>
<pre><code># iptables -I FORWARD -i virbr0 -o virbr0 -j ACCEPT
</code></pre>

<p>Since networking over the bridge interface requires <code>root</code> privileges, all
virtual machine files are put into the <code>/opt/vms</code> directory, which first needs
to be created:</p>
<pre><code># mkdir /opt/vms
# cd /opt/vms
</code></pre>
<p>The network installer for Debian Buster can be downloaded from the official
website:</p>
<pre><code># wget https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/\
debian-10.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>master</code> virtual machine is now setup using <code>virt-install</code>:</p>
<pre><code># virt-install \
    --name master \
    --memory 1024 \
    --vcpus=1,maxvcpus=2 \
    --cpu host \
    --cdrom debian-10.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso \
    --disk /opt/vms/master.qcow2,size=8,format=qcow2 \
    --network network=default \
    --virt-type kvm
</code></pre>
<p>The machine gets 1 GB of memory and a 8 GB disk. Most importantly, the network
is set to the <code>default</code> network.</p>
<p>A window showing the Debian installer appears. Just install the standard system
utilities and the SSH server. The following users and passwords shall be
configured:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>root</code>: <code>topsecret</code></li>
<li><code>user</code>: <code>secret</code></li>
</ul>
<p>After the setup is finished, just let the system boot, and login as <code>root</code>. Then
shut the virtual machine down:</p>
<pre><code># shutdown -h now
</code></pre>
<p>The two additional guest nodes can be created by cloning the <code>master</code> virtual
machine just set up:</p>
<pre><code># virt-clone --original master --name node1 --file node1.qcow2
# virt-clone --original master --name node2 --file node2.qcow2
</code></pre>
<p>Now start up all the nodes:</p>
<pre><code># virsh --connect qemu:///session start master
# virsh --connect qemu:///session start node1
# virsh --connect qemu:///session start node2
</code></pre>

<p>In order to conveniently access the guests, static IPs should be assigned to
them. The network configuration can be edited as follows:</p>
<pre><code># virsh net-edit default
</code></pre>
<p>An editor showing an XML configuration appears:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;network&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;default&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;uuid&gt;fecb90d5-9b46-48f6-8b93-e57032f8ba6a&lt;/uuid&gt;
  &lt;forward mode='nat'/&gt;
  &lt;bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/&gt;
  &lt;mac address='52:54:00:63:d3:70'/&gt;
  &lt;ip address='192.168.122.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'&gt;
    &lt;dhcp&gt;
      &lt;range start='192.168.122.2' end='192.168.122.254'/&gt;
    &lt;/dhcp&gt;
  &lt;/ip&gt;
&lt;/network&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dhcp</code> section needs to be extended with static IP definitions, which map
the MAC addresses of the guest's virtual network interfaces to the static IP
addresses to be used.</p>
<p>The MAC addresses of the virtual machines can be extracted from their
configuration as follows:</p>
<pre><code># virsh dumpxml master | grep -i '&lt;mac'
    &lt;mac address='52:54:00:db:07:7c'/&gt;
# virsh dumpxml node1 | grep -i '&lt;mac'
    &lt;mac address='52:54:00:a4:77:a9'/&gt;
# virsh dumpxml node2 | grep -i '&lt;mac'
    &lt;mac address='52:54:00:51:e8:ef'/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Using those MAC addresses, new static host definitions can be created as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;host mac='52:54:00:db:07:7c' name='master' ip='192.168.122.2'/&gt;
&lt;host mac='52:54:00:a4:77:a9' name='node1' ip='192.168.122.3'/&gt;
&lt;host mac='52:54:00:51:e8:ef' name='node2' ip='192.168.122.4'/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The XML network definition should now look as follows (the <code>uuid</code> and <code>mac
address</code> of the host will vary):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;network&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;default&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;uuid&gt;fecb90d5-9b46-48f6-8b93-e57032f8ba6a&lt;/uuid&gt;
  &lt;forward mode='nat'/&gt;
  &lt;bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/&gt;
  &lt;mac address='52:54:00:63:d3:70'/&gt;
  &lt;ip address='192.168.122.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'&gt;
    &lt;dhcp&gt;
      &lt;range start='192.168.122.2' end='192.168.122.254'/&gt;
      &lt;host mac='52:54:00:db:07:7c' name='master' ip='192.168.122.2'/&gt;
      &lt;host mac='52:54:00:a4:77:a9' name='node1' ip='192.168.122.3'/&gt;
      &lt;host mac='52:54:00:51:e8:ef' name='node2' ip='192.168.122.4'/&gt;
    &lt;/dhcp&gt;
  &lt;/ip&gt;
&lt;/network&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>After saving the configuration, the network <code>default</code> needs to be restarted:</p>
<pre><code># virsh net-destroy default
# virsh net-start default
</code></pre>
<p>The guest virtual machines must also be restarted so that they will get the new
IP addresses assigned:</p>
<pre><code># virsh shutdown master
# virsh shutdown node1
# virsh shutdown node2

# virsh --connect qemu:///session start master
# virsh --connect qemu:///session start node1
# virsh --connect qemu:///session start node2
</code></pre>
<p>The virtual machines should now be accessible through SSH:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh user@192.168.122.2
$ ssh user@192.168.122.3
$ ssh user@192.168.122.4
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that the network communication is working between the guests:</p>
<pre><code>[user@master]$ ping node1
[user@master]$ ping node2
</code></pre>
<p>Also make sure to define the proper hostname in <code>/etc/hostname</code>, for it is still
<code>master</code> for the two guests that have been cloned from the initial image:</p>
<pre><code>[root@node1]# echo 'node1' &gt; /etc/hostname
[root@node2]# echo 'node2' &gt; /etc/hostname
</code></pre>
<h2>Adding Some Comfort</h2>
<p>Consider adding the following definitions to <code>/etc/hosts</code>:</p>
<pre><code>192.168.122.2   master
192.168.122.3   node1
192.168.122.4   node2
</code></pre>
<p>So that you can access your virtual machines by their host names:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh user@master
$ ssh user@node1
$ ssh user@node2
</code></pre>
<p>In order to login to the guests without typing a password, create an SSH key
locally without any passphrase:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh-keyen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that your <code>~/.ssh</code> folder has the access mode <code>700</code>, and the contained
files all have the access mode <code>600</code> (thanks to <a href="http://marmaro.de/">meillo</a> for
pointing that out):</p>
<pre><code>$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*
</code></pre>
<p>Copy the public key to the hosts using <code>ssh-copy_id</code> (thanks to meillo again for
hinting that utility to me):</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@master
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@node1
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@node2
</code></pre>
<p>Check that the SSH connection now works without any password:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@master
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@node1
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_vms_rsa user@node2
</code></pre>

<p>Three virtual machines running Debian GNU/Linux have been installed on a
rather old laptop running Debian GNU/Linux itself. Those virtual machines can be
comfortably accessed without any passwords through SSH, and are able to
communicate with one another over a virtual network.</p>
<p>It took me almost a day ‒ and gave me some additional grey hair ‒ to get all
this information together from various sources. After I figured out how to
create the setup described above, it only took me about two hours to reproduce 
everything on another laptop (including the setup of the laptop itself) and to
write this article.</p>
<p>Since I did the try-and-error part on Arch Linux, this article can also be used
on that distribution, and probably many others as well. Only the packages to be
installed will probably vary on other distributions.</p>
<p>I plan to describe the setup of a local Puppet environment based on the setup
described above in a forthcoming article.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>What happened to the rebels of the financial revolution?</p>



<p>We’re starting this week with a quote from a piece by Ian Kar at <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fintechtoday.substack.com/" target="_blank">Fintech Today:</a></p>



<blockquote><p>In the first half of 2020, overhyped neobanks went from a contrarian opinion to a major industry talking point.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>What was just recently a contrarian opinion, is now stated as fact.</p>



<p>Just a couple of years ago, neobanks were spearheading the ‘financial revolution’, armed with a seemingly bottomless flow of venture capital.</p>



<p>Today, they’re largely out of the mainstream news cycle.</p>



<p>This week, we’re diving into the world of consumer fintech: Why did neobanks suddenly become so boring? What drove the hype cycle? Where did it go?&nbsp;</p>



<p>From there, the harder question: with the initial boom out of the way, what’s the long game for these banks?</p>



<p>We have a bunch to cover, so best get started!</p>



<h4>Cash Flows &amp; Sleek Logos</h4>



<p>Only about 2 years ago, every other week, news would break of a brand new neobank — seemingly out of nowhere — <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/one-a-new-digital-bank-aimed-at-the-middle-class-raises-17m-series-a/" target="_blank">raising</a> an 8 figure Series A, sending their CEO to speak at TechCrunch Disrupt to talk about their (very unique) company ‘values’, then hunkering down until it was Series B time.</p>



<p>Rinse, repeat.</p>



<p>Today, neobanks have reached almost meme status in tech and investing circles.</p>



<p>It quickly seemed like anyone and everyone could start a neobank. The space is extremely interesting. To get picky, almost none of the (US) neobanks are actual “banks” so to speak — they don’t store and insure client funds themselves, rather partnering with an FDIC licensed incumbent, serving as an intermediary.</p>



<p>The apparent relative ease to launch a neobank was an attractive sell for many new founders.</p>



<figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png" alt="" width="900" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png 725w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-300x66.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_700/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-700x154.png 700w" data-sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_725/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21.png 725w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-300x66.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_700/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chrome_2020-07-23_23-20-21-700x154.png 700w"><figcaption>522,000 results!</figcaption></figure>



<p>While launching a mobile bank — especially in the US — involves an immense roll of red tape, regulation, and high bars to entry, it is far less complicated than launching a “traditional” financial institution.</p>



<p>Rapidly looking to ride the trend, card issuers — namely Visa and Mastercard — scrambled to be first pick to serve these new banks in offering debit cards. In the US neobank space today, Visa fights to hold its lead.</p>



<p>As such, it quickly became a relatively smooth process to issue debit card services once your online bank was established. To add to that, several other fintech infrastructure companies quickly popped up to supplement the growth of the space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These ranged from the complex field of compliance (eg. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://alloy.co/" target="_blank">Alloy</a>), interbank connections (eg. <a href="https://plaid.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plaid</a>), and a bunch of under-the-hood services that were previously handled in-house by large banks, now being commoditized in the form of competing startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this came together to form a space perfectly ripe for creating new challenger banks with attractive brand values, all aimed at “making your finances more transparent”, “dethroning the big banks”, etc.</p>



<p>To go with the shiny mission statement, you need a shiny product — and neobanks nailed the mark.</p>



<h4>Hype Cycles &amp; Making Banking Cool</h4>



<p>I’m a brand strategy guy at heart, so seeing Starling Bank’s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.starlingbank.com/news/vertical-debit-card-launch/" target="_blank">announcement</a> of one of the first-ever vertical debit cards was a masterclass in brand differentiation. It had been tried before, but nothing had quite reached the mainstream.</p>



<figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg" alt="" width="900" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg 603w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10-300x169.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_603/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10.jpg 603w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://thistooshallpass.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PersonalBusinessDebitCards.9bd54d10-300x169.jpg 300w"></figure>



<p>Once Starling Bank made it ‘cool’, the vertical debit card and minimalistic design became&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;representation of mobile banks, quickly adopted by Venmo, N26, Revolut, and so many more.</p>



<p>This widespread aesthetic adoption, though, did little to help with the copycat, meme status beginning to plague banking startups.</p>



<p>Business strategy aside, you have to admit they look sleek…</p>



<p>In a space not exactly known for its innovative creativity, neobanks brought a fresh coat of (bold, matte) paint, both through the physical product, and user experience.</p>



<p>Brick and mortar banks have immense resources to outperform on features and depth, but this comes at the expense of simplicity. From design to product experience, neobanks solidified simplicity and minimalism as a top priority, with a heavy sprinkle of customer experience.</p>

<p>Armed with a beautiful product, a mission to make a boring field exciting and accessible, and a target market of mobile-first digital natives, the next step was to ramp up marketing spend. This was the not-so-secret sauce in bringing hype to the banking space.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/@tejas_rd" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tejas Raut Dessai</a> put it best:</p>



<blockquote><p>The menu is simple — a checking account, a debit card, and a few other adjacent services. The modus operandi is somewhat simpler too, raise a ton of cash, hit the gas on marketing, grow deposits, and leverage the spread on income to fuel more marketing.</p></blockquote>



<p>Neobanks quickly took a page out of the DTC playbook and ran up paid social spend, with a focus balanced between brand building and user acquisition.</p>



<p>My Instagram Stories ads are the perfect proof of this, as is the London Underground.</p>

<p>If you’re a neobank, the hype train is now smoothly in motion.</p>



<p>User count is skyrocketing, all seems well. In fact, ARPU is even slowly rising as your neobank is slowly moving along the adoption cycle from early-adopters to the mainstream.</p>

<p>But now the problems are beginning to creep in.</p>



<p>Hypergrowth is brilliant,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://thistooshallpass.blog/when-you-come-at-the-king/" rel="noreferrer noopener">required, even,</a>&nbsp;in the months fresh off a funding round. The issue, though, is that hypergrowth is seldom sustainable — especially when it’s largely tied to ad spend.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that sustainable growth can’t be built on paid channels, rather that it’s a much more expensive and risky long-term play, relative to building out alternative, less expensive, and organic acquisition channels.</p>



<p>Neobanks have begun to fall out of the Silicon Valley spotlight as they now begin to build out more sustainable paths to growth — or profitability.</p>



<p>It’s the end of the beginning. Next step, prepare for the future.</p>



<h4>The Long Game</h4>



<p>The rise of the neobank in the US has been a relatively recent one, compared to the rest of the western world.</p>



<p>That doesn’t come as a huge surprise though. America has long <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/92575/banking-fintech-adoption-north-america-trends/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">lagged</a> Europe in terms of consumer financial infrastructure and product innovation. Corporate finance knows no better land, but consumer tech has fallen by the wayside.</p>



<p>While the rest of the world quickly adopted chip and pin, contactless payments, and instantaneous bank transfers, the US kept&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/03a1f4b0-06d3-11e4-ba32-00144feab7de" rel="noreferrer noopener">mailing cheques</a>, swiping magnetic strips, and waiting 3-4 days for transfers.</p>



<p>This failure (refusal?) to modernize is largely why, until recently, almost all top neobanks were Europe-based.</p>



<p>US entrants are finally changing that, though. <a href="https://www.chime.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chime</a>, <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Varo</a>, and <a href="https://www.sofi.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">SoFi </a>are among the most recognizable neobank leaders today in the US, and quickly caught VC attention in the Bay Area.</p>



<p>Fast forward a couple of years to today, the widespread hype in tech and VC circles for neobanking is much more subdued.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean neobanking itself has slowed down, though.</p>



<p>Beyond offering checking accounts and debit card services, fintech companies and neobanks are making moves up, and across the value chain.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Going Up</h4>



<p>As we touched on earlier, until very recently, there have been no US-based neobanks that hold an actual banking license, with regards to FDIC coverage. This means that no neobank had been approved to have client deposits insured by the US government.</p>



<p>For this reason, as we saw before, neobanks, upon launching, partner with a sponsor banking institution, one that&nbsp;<em>does</em>&nbsp;hold an FDIC license, and operates via their services.</p>



<p>This all changed when US-based neobank Varo, recently <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/press_release/fdic-approval-moves-varo-to-final-stage-of-bank-charter-journey/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> approval by the US government to be the first mobile bank to be granted FDIC approval. This marks a watershed moment in the fintech space, allowing the company to decouple from their sponsor bank (Bancorp) and vertically integrate a significant part of their value chain.</p>



<p>In offering independence from a partner institution, Varo will be able to bring all customer data in-house, and regain control over the cut of profits the partner bank would have otherwise claimed.</p>

<p>Though license integration is nothing new for neobanks on the international scene (lead competitors such as N26, Monzo, or Revolut all already hold EU-wide banking licenses), the move up the value chain is exciting news for US-based neobanks.</p>



<p>This brings me to a prediction: within the next 2 years, we’ll have seen the first US neobank IPO.</p>



<p>Through this lens, a bank charter is an attractive line item in an S-1.</p>



<h4>And Across</h4>



<p>Integrating operations away from a partner bank to in-house, though, brings with it a need for significant resource allocation to regulatory compliance. This is the expensive downside of integration,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://e.businessinsider.com/click/19418706.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwvYmxvZy9yaXNpbmctY29tcGxpYW5jZS1jb3N0cy1odXJ0aW5nLWN1c3RvbWVycy1iYW5rcy1zYXkv/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB9b8b3c6a" rel="noreferrer noopener">representing</a>&nbsp;costs to the tune of 6-10% of revenue.</p>



<p>For the many neobanks already hemorrhaging money, engaged in a vicious race to the bottom, working hard to avoid death by a thousand Instagram mid-rolls, the extra costs vertical integration brings makes little financial sense.</p>



<p>So, instead of looking up the value chain, as in the Varo example, many neobanks are exploring lateral moves.</p>



<p>We saw earlier how most of today’s neobanks began as online checking accounts. They then expanded to offering debit card services. Now, many players are looking further afield.</p>

<p>This takes both the form of geographical expansion and product expansion.</p>



<p>Many established companies are now looking to expand operations horizontally to lending, insurance, and robo-advisory roles.</p>

        <p>Neohabitat is a relaunch of the first massively multiplayer online roleplaying game, Lucasfilm's Habitat. Originally developed in 1985 by Lucasfilm Games (now LucasArts) for the Commodore 64, Habitat is considered the grandfather of modern MMORPGs. Neohabitat is an open-source project led by Randy Farmer, one of Habitat's creators, reviving the original Habitat world.</p>

<p>I was never trained in music beyond some piano lessons as a child,
but I’ve always loved strange and interesting music and sounds.
For the last few months, I’ve been assembling a collection of patch cables
and circuit boards on my desk which, when connected just right,
can create anything from melodic sequences to fast, driving beats to
wacky electronic soundscapes.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>modular synthesizer</strong> in the Eurorack format.
Eurorack is a <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100t_e.htm">de-facto standard</a>
created by German synthesizer manufacturer Doepfer designed around the concept of
voltage control. Everything in Eurorack is controlled through changing voltages,
from -10 to +10 volts, representing everything: audio, pitch, speed, slope,
and even <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/doepfer-a-197-3-rgb-led-controller">color</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/side-shot.jpg" alt="My synthesizer shot from an “aesthetic” angle.">
</figure>

<p>As I learn more about Eurorack and the modular ecosystem, it reminds me more and more
of the magical feeling of working with UNIX tools:
it is a world that exchanges programs for filters, oscillators, and VCAs,
text for voltage, and pipes for patch cables.</p>
<h2 id="text-audio-and-control-voltage">Text, Audio, and Control Voltage</h2>
<p>We’re all used to voltage representing audio.
An “AUX cord”, correctly called a 3.5mm TRS (tip, ring, and sleeve)
stereo cable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
carries two channels of voltage and a common ground between audio devices through
a nearly universal<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> standard.
For audio signals, this voltage jumps between a maximum and minimum voltage.
Its value over time is eventually turned into the movement of a speaker or
headphone diaphragm, which in turn moves the air and can be heard.</p>
<p>In modular synthesis, though, we don’t just use these analog signals to represent the
movements of air that our ears hear as audio.
We also use them to control other parameters: pitch, for example.
Like the text streams that we use to move data around in UNIX tools,
or the JSON payloads that power a huge portion of the modern web,
voltage-based communication is simple but versatile.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/control-voltage.jpg" alt="A module in my synthesizer displaying the changes in control voltage representingpitch"></p>
<p>The micro-Ornament and Crime module displaying changing pitch values,
as represented by the voltage coming into its CV1 input.</p>

</figure>

<p>These voltages are, by their nature, analog -
there are infinitely many values between C4 and D4, or even between C4 and C#4.
Among other things, this means that complex microtonal music is not just possible,
but just as easy for the hardware to produce as music in any Western scale.</p>
<p>Text, of course, isn’t analog, but it does have similar characteristics.
It’s not always easy to parse or generate exactly the right text,
but with enough information, it’s always possible to interoperate with something
that uses a text interface, or even JSON structured data.</p>
<h2 id="oscillators-filters-grep-and-awk">Oscillators, Filters, <code>grep</code>, and <code>awk</code></h2>
<p>The traditional synthesizer, as invented by Bob Moog and co., produces sound
through a so-called <strong>subtractive</strong> process.
Sound, some kind of complex wave-form, is produced by an <strong>oscillator</strong>,
according to control voltage representing pitch.
That waveform, which has lots of harmonics, is put through an amplifier
which turns the sound on when a note is being played, and off when it is not,
and through a filter, which removes some harmonics and emphasizes others.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/threshold.jpg" alt="A Threshold module, outside of the synthesizer."></p>
<p>Just one module, removed from my synthesizer.
This is a four-oscillator retro digital voice, which produces three channels of
square waves and one “complex” waveform (noise, stepped triangle, etc.)</p>
<p>Each voice has four voltage inputs and one output, along with two buttons
and two knobs. The module also provides a “mixed” output.</p>

</figure>

<p>Of course, this is not so different from a standard UNIX log mangling pipeline,
where <code>cat</code> grabs some output from a file, <code>awk</code> formats it in some easy-to-work-with
way, <code>grep</code> cuts out irrelevant information, and <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, or a second <code>awk</code>
invocation formats the output.
This is the versatility of universal, standard interfaces like text, JSON, or voltage;
each tool does what it does, and interoperates cleanly.</p>
<h2 id="envelopes-signal-flow-and-mkfifo">Envelopes, Signal Flow, and <code>mkfifo</code></h2>
<p>In my rack, I have a simple signal flow mapped out by the sequence of modules.
My <a href="https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-sol">Winterbloom Sol</a> turns digital
signals into control voltage.
The <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/kinks/">Kinks</a>,
<a href="https://pushermanproductions.com/product/jakplugg-open-source-pique-4hp-peaks-pcb-fr4-panel/">Pique</a>
and <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">Ornament and Crime</a> modules shape that CV.
Then come two oscillators, a filter, a set of amplifiers, and some effects.</p>
<p>But that’s not necessarily the order I actually patch the signal chain.</p>
<p>Most synths have an “envelope” control, sometimes controlling the level of a signal,
and sometimes controlling a filter.
The magic of modular is that each of those components is discrete.
One module generates control voltage every time a note is played.
Another module (a <strong>voltage controlled amplifier</strong> or VCA) uses that control voltage
to change the volume of the note,
turning a rising voltage into attack and falling voltage into decay.
A third  module (a <strong>voltage controlled filter</strong>) uses that control voltage to change
the harmonic content of the sound. Just by moving a cable from the “FM” input to the
“Q” input, that filter can go from subtracting harmonics to emphasizing them,
or maybe both!</p>
<p>This is the flexibility of modular synthesis.
Every signal exists within a constrained realm, and every module manufacturer
knows what their interface should expect.
Each module does some transformation - in a sense, every module represents
a mathematical funtion, transforming voltage-over-time and knob positions
into voltage-over-time, which can itself be transformed by further modules.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily something we see often in UNIX programming -
but it is possible!
With <code>mkfifo</code>, we can create more complex data flows and unique ways of moving
information around, using multiple FIFOs as input and output files.
In web systems, this kind of many-way connection is very common;
even relatively simple systems like If This Then That allow users to create
long, wide, branching data flows, and even flows that contain cycles.
Ideally, each program or API does work like a mathematical function,
taking command line arguments and input and transforming them into
output and perhaps some side effects, like making a Mastodon post or
writing to disk or a database.</p>
<h2 id="modularity-open-source-and-market-forces">Modularity, Open Source, and Market Forces</h2>
<p>In the forward to  <em>The UNIX Time-Sharing System</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,
the seminal 1978 paper on UNIX, Doug McIlroy articulates the philosophy of modularity
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh.</li>
<li>Expect the output of every program to become the input of another, unknown,
program.</li>
<li>Design and build software […] to be tried early, ideally within weeks. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the same values that motivate the design of the best Eurorack modules.
Each module is easy to experiment with, designed to accomplish one or a few tasks,
explicitly built to integrate with other modules, and well-documented.</p>
<p>Eurorack’s modularity works well because there is no incentive to lock in users -
indeed, there is a significant disincentive, since no one small company
could ever hope to produce a universal product line.
Building modules that work well in as many systems as possible is the best way
to maximize sales.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/front-shot.jpg" alt="A front-on shot of my case, along with my Beatstep Pro controller"></p>
<p>My whole synthesizer is controlled by this Beatstep Pro, and optionally by Linux
software like 100r ORCA.</p>

</figure>

<p>Indeed, even in the cases where larger companies (like Intellijel) have tried to
invent their own standards to get at least some degree of lock-in revenue,
the size of the market limits the effectiveness of that strategy.
Their smaller, 1U form factor has been widely adopted, and there are now nearly
a dozen small manufacturers making compatible modules.</p>
<p>We, as software engineers, should strive to build software that is amenable to
interoperability, because that is the most effective way to support creativity.
Documented, open, and capable APIs are good, if your software must be centralized;
federation through open protocols is even better.</p>
<p>Critically, your interface does not need to be optimal.
Control voltage in 1v/Oct certainly isn’t; it requires difficult and imprecise
exponential conversion circuits, or slow and expensive floating point computations.
Consider, for instance, ActivityPub and the Mastodon ecosystem.
Eugen Rochko could have easily stuck with OStatus, which does have some advantages,
but the Mastodon project’s move to ActivityPub catalzyed an entire ecosystem,
with dozens of other microblogging products, as well as blogs, video sharing,
music sharing, and photo sharing software springing up, all able to interoperate
at least somewhat.</p>
<p>Modularity also promotes longevity.
The predecessor to <code>ls</code> was written in 1961<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>; the GNU <code>find</code> command has
history as far back as 1987<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. These programs are so deeply embedded in the brain
stem of computing that building a modern server operating system without something
compatible is nearly unthinkable.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/open-source.jpg" alt="Another side shot of my synthesizer."></p>
<p>Every module in this photograph is open source - software and hardware.</p>

</figure>

<p>I should also point out that, while free and open source software is,
in my opinion, a moral good,
software freedom and open protocols/interfaces are tangential concerns.
While many Eurorack modules are open source, some of the most popular are not;
for example, Make Noise’s analog computer Maths is not an open source design,
but it is the heart of many modular systems because it integrates well into
the ecosystem and has a clearly documented and well-specified interface.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Simple Storage Service, for instance, is a proprietary service with an open
protocol, and it is hugely successful - so much so that many projects have sprung up
to implement its interface, and a huge volume of cloud software is designed to work
with “S3 - and other stuff that works the same.”</p>
<p>Modularity is the most direct path to innovation. As software engineers,
we should do our absolute best, both technically and politically, to build
programs that do one thing well,
programs that can be tried early,
and programs that work well together.
Anything else guarantees stagnation, lock-in, frustration, and eventual obscurity.</p>

When I was a wee lad, I loved the movie the Social Network. The movie revolved around Mark Zuckerberg starting Facebook from his college dorm room. I would get so inspired after watching that I would proclaim to my friends, “I”m going to build the next Facebook!”. Then I would open up my <del>pirated</del> copy of Adobe DreamWeaver and pretend to know was doing. </p><p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/cedc741cbcef0b97cc652ad9cb29d0ad/tenor.gif?itemid=13969571" alt="People from the Social Network   movie staring at computer" title="Rare footage of me in 2009 having no idea what I'm doing"></p><p>At the time, I did not know much html. And the only css I knew was how to the change the color of text. But I was going to write the next Facebook.</p><h4>Spoiler Alert: <em>I didn’t write the next Facebook</em>.</h4><p>The truth is, Facebook was <strong>not</strong> Zuckerberg’s first website. He was already an experienced programmer by the time he started Facebook. And no one talks about the projects he made before he got to Harvard. That’s an important thing to remember, your first projects are going to suck and no one but you will want to use them. And that’s okay!</p><p>In the game development community, there is a common piece of advice given to beginners. “Don’t write an MMO as your first game”. It's not surprising that aspiring gamedevs come into the field wanting to create the games they enjoy playing. This advice is not meant to be discouraging. What said is that you have to crawl before you can walk. If you dediate yourself to a huge project early on, you will become overwhemled and burn out.</p><p>But if you accept that your first works will suck, you will grow and learn what you can do. The faster you get past the sucky bits, the faster you get to the <em>not so bad</em> parts.</p><h2><a name="programming-is-a-change-in-mindset" href="#programming-is-a-change-in-mindset" id="programming-is-a-change-in-mindset" title="Anchor Link"></a>Programming is a change in mindset</h2><p>Learning to program is not about learning how to use the latest Javascript libraries. Its not about learning how binary works (Though that’s not a bad path). Its not even about learning a language .

Computers are purely logical. A computer will do what it's told. A computer knows only the information its given. If your program is not doing something you want, this means you need to step through how the computer is interpreting what's being told.</p><p>This can be a foreign concept for some. You have to think like a computer. People who tend to be better at math pick up programming a bit quicker. For me, I am not naturally good at math, so this took me a long time to grasp.</p><h2><a name="experienced-programmers-question-their-expertise-all-of-the-time" href="#experienced-programmers-question-their-expertise-all-of-the-time" id="experienced-programmers-question-their-expertise-all-of-the-time" title="Anchor Link"></a>Experienced programmers question their expertise all of the time</h2><p>To this day I still question if I am an imposter and I have been programming for over 10 years.

This page provides links to digitised versions of old maths textbooks. All the books listed here are available to view for free online. There are probably thousands of old maths textbooks online, so this list is by no means exhaustive. Note that I have mainly listed algebra and arithmetic books (rather than geometry books) because that's my area of interest.</p><p>

<p><b>Early 20th Century</b></p>

















<p>
Due to copyright restrictions there are relatively few books available online from the 20th Century. I recommend ordering from&nbsp;<a href="http://abebooks.co.uk/" target="_blank">abebooks.co.uk</a>&nbsp;(or looking in maths department offices!) if you're interested in maths textbooks from this period.</p>
<p>
* I have marked a few of my favourite books with a star.</p>
<br></div>

<br></div>
<div>
<p>
Some of these books have multiple editions available online, but to keep this page manageable I have only listed one edition in each case.</p><p>

        <div>
            <p><a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> is a tool that proxies traffic from a
subdomain (like <a href="http://2fb551c6b2fd.ngrok.io/">http://2fb551c6b2fd.ngrok.io</a>) to a port on your localhost. I’ve
been using it off and on for years. There’s a couple use cases I’ve used it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward web traffic to a local next.js / webpack server, to show a website in
progress without having to deploy it. This way I can send an ngrok link to a
friend/coworker and they can see the latest.</li>
<li>Forward api traffic from a device (ex. an iPhone if I’m working on an iOS app) to my
local api server.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been very useful, but recently I’ve switched to
<a href="https://github.com/omrikiei/ktunnel"><code>ktunnel</code></a>. <code>ktunnel</code> deploys a service on
kubernetes, which will proxy traffic to a local port of your choice. It’s more
work to set up than <code>ngrok</code>, so it won’t be worth the hassle for a lot of
people, but there’s a few upsides to self-hosting.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit for me is that I can use my own domain, so instead of a
random ngrok subdomain I’ll set it up on something like
<a href="http://apiproxy.mbuffett.com/">http://apiproxy.mbuffett.com</a>. Additionally, there’s no connections limit,
you’re only limited by the server you’re hosting your cluster on. Last but not
least, it’s free if you have a cluster available, which I happened to have.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>I’ll assume that you have a kubernetes cluster running. If you don’t, and want to get started with one,
you can start a cluster and connect to it with kubectl pretty quickly. I
recommend Digital Ocean, they have an easier setup than AWS/GKE. Once you’re at
the point where you can run <code>kubectl get all</code>, and have an ingress controller
set up (I use
<a href="https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/kong-for-kubernetes/install/">kong</a>), then you’re
good to go.</p>
<h3 id="running">Running</h3>
<p>First, you’ll need to install <code>ktunnel</code>, check out the installation instructions
<a href="https://github.com/omrikiei/ktunnel">here</a> for the latest. I built from source
but you can also get the latest binary. After that, you can start ktunnel like
this:</p>
<pre><code>ktunnel expose ktunnel-proxy &lt;LOCAL_PORT&gt;
</code></pre><p>This will create aservice on your cluster called <code>ktunnel-proxy</code>, which will
take traffic on port 80 and forward it to your localhost on port <code>&lt;LOCAL_PORT&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The next step is to expose the new service to the world. To do that, create an
ingress that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ktunnel-proxy
spec:
  rules:
    - host: proxy.&lt;YOUR_TLD&gt;
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: ktunnel-proxy
              servicePort: 80
</code></pre><p>Of course, you’ll also have to set up DNS to get traffic from <code>YOUR_TLD</code> to go to
your cluster. If you’re using Digital Ocean, you can point the A records to
a load balancer that points to your cluster.</p>
<p>So after this, when you go to <code>proxy.&lt;YOUR_TLD&gt;</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS will resolve to your cluster IP</li>
<li>The ingress controller will direct traffic to the <code>ktunnel-proxy</code> service</li>
<li>The <code>ktunnel-proxy</code> service will direct traffic to your <code>&lt;LOCAL_PORT&gt;</code> on
your localhost</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="gotchas">Gotchas</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that the termination process for ktunnel will try to delete the
service and deployment it created on startup. If you’ve lost internet connection
or something, it’s possible this doesn’t get run. If <code>ktunnel</code> isn’t able to
start up, you may want to run <code>kubectl get services</code> and see if there’s a stray
<code>ktunnel</code> service hanging around.</p>

<p>There’s always been a considerable level of criticism against Java from a big sector of our industry; this criticism has been mostly focused on Java’s <strong>verbosity and the amount of boilerplate code it generates</strong> in many cases without need. Although I’ve always liked Java, I couldn’t say that these allegations are wrong; it’s indeed true that Java’s verbosity and its amount of clutter could become very annoying in multiple occasions. Although most of the times we have to accept that we don’t live in a perfect world and in most of the cases we have to accept the lesser of two evils. So yes, Java wasn’t perfect, we all know that, but the main question is why nothing was done before to address these concerns.</p>



<p>In my personal opinion, the only reason why changes took so long is because there wasn’t enough competition for Java, things were right as they were. <strong>Java language was dominating the market probably due to the lack of serious competitors</strong> and due to the big efforts made by Sun first and then Oracle afterwards.</p>



<p><strong>The strong type safety provided by Java and some of its characteristics as a well-structured language made it a very popular language for big projects</strong>; by using Java it’s generally more difficult to get things really out of hand. Also one of the main characteristics of Java, being a multi platform language which runs on its own virtual machine, made it a perfect match for many organisations. If you add its inherent capability of performing automatic performance optimisations through its famous JIT compiler, something that minimises in many cases the effects of badly-written code, then you have a pretty solid set of reasons to use Java.</p>



<p>But then what happened? What happened is that new languages able to run in the same JVM as Java were introduced into the market; languages that were eliminating some of the biggest annoyances in Java and offering a nicer environment to developers with quite a flat learning curve in some cases.</p>



<p>Before we continue let’s recapitulate and take a brief tour through the history of JVM languages!</p>



<h2>History of JVM languages</h2>



<p>Once thing I’d like to clarify before we start, is that I’ve skipped some of the existing JVM languages mainly because they never got enough traction to be considered candidates to be used widely in our industry. Having said that, let’s kick off our quick tour thorough JVM languages history!</p>







<p>To start with our tour we have to start with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a> of course, the oldest and most popular language in the JVM world.<br><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a> was officially released in January 1996</strong>, so it’s been around for twenty-four years already; not bad, eh? Initially Java was a purely imperative language following a purely object-oriented programming style; also being a strongly typed language.  Java’s syntax is similar in some way to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank">C++</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C</a> languages, but it’s considered an improved version because it’s much easier to write code with Java than C or C++. On the other hand, we have that the biggest argument among its detractors is its verbosity.</p>



<p>The second JVM language that was released was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a>; it started being around since 2003, although <strong>it’s first official and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Community_Process" target="_blank">standardised</a> version 1.0 didn’t come up until January 2007</strong>. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groovy-lang.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a> had the benefit of being able to be <strong>used as a scripting language as well</strong>. Groovy is a <strong>dynamically typed language</strong>, so type checks occur at runtime; this is one of the reasons why some developers don’t like Groovy. You write your code in Groovy, it looks correct on compilation time but then on runtime is when you realise that there’s something  wrong.</p>







<p>A very popular language for a few years came up next, we’re talking about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a>. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a> was officially released in 2004</strong> and it brought <strong>a new programming model to the JVM world with functional programming</strong> and its declarative approach. We could affirm that Scala was the first to bring this concept of immutability that we’ve talked about before, so it has done very good things for the Java transformation. On the other hand, Scala detractors don’t like it due to its complex grammar and in general low readability.</p>







<p>The next language to make its appearance in the JVM world was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank">Clojure</a>, a purely functional language that is becoming quite popular recently but it <strong>first appeared in 2007</strong>. Clojure is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">LISP</a> based language characterised by its simplicity and the use of pure functions. Among its drawbacks we could mention that it’s dynamically typed (same as Groovy) and the learning curve is much steeper, as its syntax is completely different from other JVM languages. There are a couple of good books that you should read if you’re interested in learning <strong><em>Clojure</em></strong>: “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://geni.us/hurUc7p" target="_blank">The joy of Clojure</a>” and “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://geni.us/7azovHB" target="_blank">Programming Clojure: 3rd Edition</a>“.</p>







<p>And lastly but not least we have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank">Kotlin</a>! <strong>Kotlin</strong> was first released in <strong>February 2016 </strong>and since then it hasn’t stopped growing in popularity. It was designed by the company <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">JetBrains</a> with one clear goal: eliminate all the  most popular Java problems. In the way it’s been designed <strong>it has kept all the good things about Java </strong>but at the same time <strong>eliminating the majority of its problems</strong>; that’s why it’s becoming so popular and many consider that it could defeat Java in the next few years. If you want to know more about <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> (I encourage to do so, as it’s a great language), I’d recommend that you read the book <a href="https://geni.us/f4BI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Kotlin in Action”</a>, a fantastic book to start with <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> for Java developers.</p>

<p>So this are the most important JVM languages, we have skipped some others that are not so popular but we could mention some of them: <strong>Jython, JRuby, Ceylon, Fantom, et</strong>c. You can check the whole list of the existing JVM languages <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>One thing that we could notice is that <strong>Java didn’t have much competitors in the first eight or ten years</strong> but since then it started having some competition; so is having competition good or bad?</p>



<h2>Benefits of increased competition</h2>



<p>As we mentioned earlier, Java hadn’t changed too much in its early years probably because there was no need for it; the language was widely used and very popular despite of being far from perfect.</p>



<p>But then new competitors showed up, more modern languages that were bringing new features and solving some of the pain points that Java developers had been suffering for a long time.</p>



<p>For instance, let’s look at <strong><em>Scala</em></strong> language; Scala’s popularity was increasing since 2009, developers were welcoming this new functional style that allowed them more flexibility and also write parallel code safely and easily. We can see this trend in the following Google Trends graph:</p>

<p>What was Oracle’s reaction to this new trend? Java Lambdas and Streams were released in 2014. I think we can all agree that at that point was when Java made its biggest step to defeat Scala; everyone who currently works in the industry can feel that lose of steam that Scala has been suffering in the recent years.</p>



<p>One more benefit in having more competitors in the JVM world is the <strong>continuous improvements that JIT compiler and the JVM itself are experiencing.</strong> Now there are much more people interested in having an optimised JVM and improved performance optimisations. So competition has been a good thing for everyone!</p>



<p>The last competitor to appear in the arena has been <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> has been very important because in some way it has shown Oracle the way to go forward. <strong><em>Kotlin</em></strong> has shown that it’s possible to keep the good parts of Java but creating a more concise and fast to code language.</p>



<p>If we look at Google Trends to see how popular has Kotlin been in the last  few years this is what we have:</p>

<p>So it seems that Kotlin became quite popular fairly quickly but it seems to be settling down in the last couple of years.</p>



<p>Oracle has taken good notes of the industry’s reactions with regards to Kotlin and if you take a look at the JDK 15 release notes, you can see that some of the Java new features are basically copies of what Kotlin had changed. For example, the <strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359" target="_blank">new Java records</a></em></strong>, the new <strong><em>text blocks</em></strong> (multi-line string with triple quotes) or the new <strong><em>switch</em></strong> statement; which is more or less a copy of Kotlin <strong><em>when</em></strong> statement. You can take a look at JDK 15 release notes <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jdk.java.net/15/release-notes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>All of this we’ve talked about is what I call <strong>“The Kotlinisation of Java”</strong>; by becoming its stronger competitor in its history, Kotlin has shown Java the way to go. From my point of view Kotlin has been the only language I’ve seen that could overcome Java as a leader in our industry.</p>



<h2>The “Kotlinisation” of Java</h2>



<p>Some of the upcoming Java features are going to be a massive improvement for Java in terms of readability and in terms of improving one of the main weaknesses in Java, its verbosity. We could affirm that they all have <strong>a suspicious similarity with some Kotlin features</strong>.</p>



<p>Please keep in mind that most of these features are <strong>feature previews</strong>, what means that if you install JDK 14 or JDK 15 when it gets released, <strong>you won’t be able to use them by default.</strong></p>



<p>Java feature previews are new features that are introduced in a release but are disabled by default; they’re <strong>included in the release just to gather feedback from the community of developers</strong>, so they’re <strong>still subject to changes</strong> and that’s why it’s not recommend to use them in production code.</p>



<p>To enable them at compilation time you’d have to do the following:</p>



<pre><code>javac --enable-preview --release 14</code></pre>



<p>If you want to enable them at runtime you’d have to run the following:</p>



<pre><code>java --enable-preview YourClass</code></pre>



<p>Of course, you can also enable them in your IDE, but <strong>be careful to not enable previews by default</strong> in all your new projects!</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at those changes that are going to have a bigger impact on our coding with future versions of Java!</p>



<h4>Java records</h4>



<p>Java records are a feature that many of us have been demanding for a long time; I guess you’ve been in the same situation multiple times, when you reluctantly have to implement <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#toString--" target="_blank">toStri…</a></p></div></div>

        <p>Better living through reliability.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://sre-blog.com/2020-07-29-base-alerts.html">Base Alerts</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://sre-blog.com/2020-07-29-base-alerts.html">2020-07-29</a></p>
<p>
As we migrated from host base alerts to application alerts with
Prometheus, devs asked which alerts they should implement. A reasonable
question. The common and (in my opinion) not super useful answer are the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/">Four
Golden Signals</a>.
The golden signals, while technically correct, remain open to
interpretation which is friction to understanding.
</p>

<p>
So instead I'll give you the list of alerts you should have for every
production service (in alphabetical order):
</p><ul>
  <li>CPUUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>DiskUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>FileDescriptorsTooHigh</li>
  <li>GoroutinesTooHigh</li>
  <li>JVMHeapUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>MemoryUsageTooHigh</li>
  <li>PodContainerRestarting</li>
  <li>ProbeFailing</li>
  <li>ProcessCrashlooping</li>
  <li>ProcessCrashloopingSlowly</li>
  <li>Server500sTooHigh</li>
  <li>ServerLatencyTooHigh</li>
  <li>TaskDown</li>
  <li>TooManyTasksDown</li>
</ul>


<p>
These come out of experience running distributed systems from several prior
companies. Now one might argue that some of these are redundant or not
applicable to certain circumstances, and you'd be right! But if you're arguing
with me about nuance, then I've done my job to provide enough of a framework
for you to build on and mold to your specific needs.
</p>

<p>
In future posts, we'll expand on each of these, explaining why each is useful,
what each intends to catch, what types of services might not need these alerts,
etc.

<p>9th April 2019</p>
<p>This is a two-digit LED digital thermometer I made as a birthday present for my friend’s son. As he's only two years old he can’t read yet, but he can read numbers, so I thought it would be fun for him to have something that would tell him the temperature on a seven-segment display:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/twodigitthermometer2.jpg" alt="TwoDigitThermometer2.jpg" width="710" height="360"></p>
<p><em>Two-digit thermometer, based on an ATtiny84 and a DS18B20 1-Wire temperature sensor.</em></p>
<p>It uses a DS18B20 1-Wire temperature sensor, and an ATtiny84 to drive the display and read the sensor. It's just over 25mm square; about the size of a British 50 pence piece.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The two-digit thermometer is designed so it could be put in a waterproof case outside the window, to show the outside temperature in all weathers. To conserve power the thermometer flashes the temperature every 24 seconds, and then goes to sleep, and it achieves a battery life of about a year with a CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thermometer can display temperatures between -19°C and 99°C. To display temperatures between -10°C and -19°C the left-hand display is used to display "-1". Outside this range it displays 'Lo' for temperatures below -19°C or 'Hi' for temperatures above 99°C. If you live in a part of the world where temperatures regularly reach below -19°C you could change it to light the decimal points to indicate negative temperatures.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the circuit, following the way the prototype was laid out on the breadboard:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/twodigitthermometer.gif" alt="TwoDigitThermometer.gif" width="617" height="282"></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the Two-Digit Thermometer, based on an ATtiny84 and a DS18B20 temperature sensor.</em></p>
<p>The ATtiny84 has just enough I/O lines to drive the display and read the one-wire input from the DS18B20 temperature sensor. I used the 8MHz internal clock, as my 1-wire interface was designed to work at 8MHz.</p>
<h3>Construction</h3>
<h4>The prototype</h4>
<p>I built a prototype on a mini breadboard, available from SparkFun <sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup> or HobbyTronics in the UK <sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>:</p>

<p>For the prototype I used a TO-92 DS18B20, and a PDIP ATtiny84. The display was a two-digit seven-segment common-anode 3.6" LED display type 3621AS from AliExpress.</p>
<h4>The PCB</h4>
<p>For the final version I designed a board in Eagle and sent it to PCBWay for fabrication <sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>. There's a link to the Eagle files at the end of the article if you want to make yourself a board.</p>
<p>This used an ATtiny84 in an SOIC package, and a DS18B20 in an 8-pin µSOP package available from RS-Online <sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup> or AliExpress <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>. The resistors, capacitor, and LED are all 0805 size. I soldered all the SMD components apart from the display using a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun set to 250°C.</p>
<p>The LED display was a two-digit seven-segment common-anode 10mm surface-mount type <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>, and I soldered this with a&nbsp;conventional soldering iron. I built two versions, with red and yellow displays. Here's the yellow one:</p>

<p><em>Version of the two-digit thermometer with a yellow LED display.</em></p>
<p>The battery holder is an SMD 20mm coin cell holder available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>, or from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>, soldered to the back of the board:</p>

<p>Note that if you are making this thermometer for a child, please bend the tabs on the coin cell holder, after inserting the cell, so the coin cell can't be removed and swallowed.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>The main program stays in sleep mode most of the time to save power, and gets woken up by an interrupt from the watchdog timer.</p>
<h4>Reading the temperature sensor</h4>
<p>The 1-wire interface to the temperature sensor is based on my earlier&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1LJD">Simple 1-Wire Interface</a>, using the ATtiny84’s 16-bit Timer/Counter1 to do the timing. It is set up with a 1MHz clock:</p>
<pre>void OneWireSetup () {
  TCCR1A = 0&lt;&lt;WGM10;                   // Normal mode
  TCCR1B = 0&lt;&lt;WGM12 | 2&lt;&lt;CS10;         // Normal mode, divide clock by 8
}</pre>
<p>The routine <strong>DelayMicros()</strong>&nbsp;then gives a delay in a specified number of microseconds by waiting for a compare match with output compare register OCR0A:</p>
<pre>void DelayMicros (unsigned int micro) {
  TCNT1 = 0; TIFR1 = 1&lt;&lt;OCF1A;
  OCR1A = micro;
  while ((TIFR1 &amp; 1&lt;&lt;OCF1A) == 0);
}</pre>
<p>The routine <strong>DisplayTemperature()</strong> reads the temperature from the DS18B20 and displays it. Since there is only one device on the bus you can ignore the serial number, and just send a Skip ROM command which sends subsequent commands to any device:</p>
<pre>void DisplayTemperature () {
  cli();                                  // No interrupts
  if (OneWireReset() != 0) {
    sei();
    DisplayError(0);                      // Device not found
  } else {
    OneWireWrite(SkipROM);
    OneWireWrite(ConvertT);
    while (OneWireRead() != 0xFF);
    OneWireReset();
    OneWireWrite(SkipROM);
    OneWireWrite(ReadScratchpad);
    OneWireReadBytes(9);
    sei();                                // Interrupts
    if (OneWireCRC(9) == 0) {
      int temp = DataWords[0];
      Display((temp+8)&gt;&gt;4);               // Round to nearest degree
    } else DisplayError(1);               // CRC error
  }
}</pre>
<p>The DS18B20 returns the temperature as a signed 16-bit integer in units of 1/16th of a degree. This is rounded to the nearest degree and displayed by calling <strong>Display()</strong>.</p>
<h4>Errors</h4>
<p>The routine <strong>DisplayError()</strong> displays errors in the 1-wire interface:</p>
<pre>void DisplayError (int no) {
  Buffer[0] = Error;
  Buffer[1] = no;
}</pre>
<p>If the 1-wire interface fails to find a 1-wire device on the bus it displays <strong>E0</strong>. If the 1-wire interface gets a CRC error in the data read from the temperature sensor it displays <strong>E1</strong>.</p>
<h4>Multiplexing the display</h4>
<p>As in a few of my previous projects, the display is generated under interrupt, using the contents of the array&nbsp;<strong>Buffer[]</strong>. For example, to display "20" execute:</p>
<pre>Buffer[0]=2; Buffer[1]=0;</pre>
<p>The program uses Timer/Counter0 to generate an interrupt at 125Hz, fast enough to avoid flicker, which is used to multiplex the display. It is first configured in&nbsp;<strong>setup()</strong>:</p>
<pre>  TCCR0A = 2&lt;&lt;WGM00;                      // CTC mode; count up to OCR0A
  TCCR0B = 0&lt;&lt;WGM02 | 4&lt;&lt;CS00;            // Divide by 256
  OCR0A = 250-1;                          // Compare match at 125Hz
  TIMSK0 = 0;                             // Interrupts initially off</pre>
<p>The compare match interrupt service routine calls&nbsp;<strong>DisplayNextDigit()</strong> and counts down a ticks counter:</p>
<pre>ISR(TIM0_COMPA_vect) {
  DisplayNextDigit();
  Ticks--;
}</pre>
<p><strong>DisplayNextDigit()</strong> reads the data in the appropriate element of&nbsp;<strong>Buffer[]</strong>&nbsp;and lights the segments in the corresponding display digit. The program uses a #define to cater for both common cathode and common anode displays. If your circuit displays "88" when you first connect power you've probably got this wrong. Here's the common cathode version:</p>
<pre>void DisplayNextDigit () {
  PORTB = PORTB | 1&lt;&lt;digit;                    // Turn old digit off
  digit = digit ^ 1;                           // Toggle between 0 and 1
  char segs = charArray[Buffer[digit]];
  PORTA = segs;                                // Lit segments high
  PORTB = PORTB &amp; ~(1&lt;&lt;digit);                 // Turn new digit on
}</pre>
<p>Finally, the routine <strong>Display()</strong> decodes a two-digit number into <strong>Buffer[]</strong>:</p>
<pre>void Display (int n) {
  int units = n % 10;
  int tens = n / 10;
  int temp0 = tens;
  int temp1 = abs(units);
  if (tens &lt; -1) {temp0 = Lo; temp1 = Lo+1; }
  else if (tens &gt; 9) {temp0 = Hi; temp1 = Hi+1; }
  else if (tens == -1) temp0 = Minus1;
  else if ((tens == 0) &amp;&amp; (units &gt;= 0)) temp0 = Blank;
  else if ((tens == 0) &amp;&amp; (units &lt; 0)) temp0 = Minus;
  Buffer[0] = temp0;
  Buffer[1] = temp1;
}</pre>
<p><span>It handles the special cases of temperatures below -19°C, temperatures between -19°C and -10°C, and temperatures above 99°C.</span></p>
<h4><span>Saving power</span></h4>
<p>To keep the power consumption as low as possible the program disables the ADC as it isn't used, turns off the clocks to the USI and ADC, and enables the PWR_DOWN sleep mode:</p>
<pre>  ADCSRA &amp;= ~(1&lt;&lt;ADEN);                   // Disable ADC to save power
  PRR = 1&lt;&lt;PRUSI | 1&lt;&lt;PRADC;              // Turn off clocks to USI &amp; ADC to save power
  set_sleep_mode(SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN);</pre>
<h4>The main program</h4>
<p>The main program displays the temperature for a tenth of a second, and then goes to sleep. I found that this was about the shortest display time that was clear to read.</p>
<p>I found that it's quite difficult to keep your eyes focussed on the display, without blinking, when you're waiting for the next temperature flash. I therefore added a two-second countdown, which flashes the decimal points in turn, before showing the temperature. This should have a negligible effect on the current consumption:</p>
<pre>void loop () {
  Buffer[0] = DP; Buffer[1] = Blank;
  DisplayOn(12);
  WDDelay(6);                              // Sleep for 1 second
  Buffer[0] = Blank; Buffer[1] = DP;
  DisplayOn(12);
  WDDelay(6);                              // Sleep for 1 second
  DisplayTemperature();
  DisplayOn(12);
  WDDelay(9);                              // Sleep for 8 seconds
  WDDelay(9);                              // Sleep for 16 seconds
  WDDelay(9);                              // Sleep for 24 seconds
}</pre>
<p>The display remains off for 24 seconds between flashes, using three calls with the watchdog timer's maximum delay of 8 seconds. The current consumption when displaying the temperature is 6.6mA, and when asleep is 4.7µA, so the average current consumption is 1/240 x 6.6mA. The CR2032 button cell has a typical capacity of 225mAh, so the expected life is:</p>
<p>(225/6.6) x 240 / 24 = 340 days, or approximately a year.</p>
<h3>Lowest temperature</h3>
<p>Given that this circuit might be used at very low temperatures I was interested in the temperature range of the components I used.</p>
<p>The ATtiny84 and LED display are rated at -40°C to +85°C. The DS18B20 and resistors and capacitors are rated at -55°C to +125°C. The limiting factor will be the CR2032 button cell, which is rated at between -20°C and +70°C. You could extend this by using the equivalent BR2032 lithium-carbon monofluoride button cell which is rated between -30°C to +85°C.</p>
<h3>Compiling the program</h3>
<p>I compiled the program using&nbsp;Spence Konde's ATTiny Core&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>. Choose the&nbsp;<strong>ATtiny24/44/84</strong>&nbsp;option under the&nbsp;<strong>ATTinyCore</strong>&nbsp;heading on …</p></div></div>

 <li>Part 3: Johannes Huebner on how he wants to democratise electric car conversions.</li></ol>

<h2 id="johannes-can-you-tell-us-a-little-how-you-got-started-with-electric-vehicles">Johannes, can you tell us a little how you got started with electric vehicles?</h2>

<p>It started in 2008. I graduated from University with a degree in Computer Science and electrical engineering. I always had a knack for this stuff, soldering, the hardware part and also some software. The initial motivation was that I was probably going to have to commute and just thinking that I would turn on my diesel car every day…It smells terrible in the morning when it is a cold start, it pollutes the city… it felt so wrong. This is what got me into electric traction.</p>

<p>I thought about a go-kart, but that didn’t seem like a good idea. Taking the bike was a lot more practical in the end, but it sparked the idea of EV conversions. The second motivation was purely technical, <strong>I found it intriguing that you can control these large powerful motors with a few lines of code and control very precisely what it can do</strong>… That’s fascinating.</p>

<p>I started with the controller code that was about forty lines of code. It was enough to spin the motor, of course, code started to grow as it got better. At the start I blew up some components, but amazingly little, thankfully after that not too much. From there on, I spent time after work and persisted on it over years. The first conversion rolled out in 2012/13, roughly 5 years after I started.</p>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Proud-of-my-first-transaxle.jpg" width="400" alter="first transaxle"></p>

<h2 id="why-open-and-free-software-and-hardware">Why open and free software and hardware?</h2>

<p>I set up an electric car forum where I published the results of my experiments. At some point I was confident that what I built could be used by other people.</p>

<p>At the time. I was a Linux person and I liked the idea of open source, as opposed to Intellectual property. <strong>Hiding or being secretive, I never liked that. So, I decided to start something similar, but for automotive motor control</strong>.</p>

<p>At the time, AC motor control was considered something very complicated that only specialist companies would be able to manage. I wanted to show people that it is not that hard and I wanted people to be able to use these superior AC motors. The code was a great way to achieve that.</p>

<figure><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/the-very-first-prototype.jpg" width="400" alter="first prototype"> 
 <figcaption>First prototype.</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="why-are-ac-motors-superior">Why are AC Motors superior?</h2>

<p>DC motors have large mechanical components. Many properties of the dynamics of the DC motor control are managed mechanically. They cannot be controlled by software precisely. It’s hard to transfer energy back into the battery with DC motors. They wear out because of the moving parts. But, AC motors don’t have these problems and they can be precisely controlled. And I mean, there’s no production costs.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-got-the-project-off-the-ground-what-happened-then">So you got the project off the ground, what happened then?</h2>

<p>I decided to go open source with both hardware and software. Around that time I came across an open source charger project. I learned a lot from that project, there were many things that I thought didn’t need to be there. It made me focus on how to improve my own designs. It also made me think that perhaps I needed to create a kit.</p>

<p>Soon after, I noticed what <a href="http://coders4climatestrike.com/2020/06/a-community-that-converts-cars-to-electric-part-2-damien-maguire-interview.html">Damien</a> was doing. I was fascinated by the way he had been doing things and by his enthusiasm. I have to admit, I was very proud when he contacted me to get one of the my kits. He was one of the first people to inquire about it. He set it up online on his YouTube channel. I was very happy to be in contact with Damien. This is a relationship that’s been growing ever since. The designs are open source, so he took the design and adjusted it to use the Tesla motors. <strong>The rest is history. It’s a lot of back and forth between us. I took his ideas and put them back into my design and it’s just very much open source is supposed to work.</strong></p>

 <figcaption>First kit.</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="i-guess-that-is-how-open-inverter-came-about-then-or-is-it-a-collection-of-things">I guess that is how Open Inverter came about then, or is it a collection of things?</h2>

<p>It has become a collection. Initially, Open Inverter was just one inverter.</p>

<p>One of the main problems to bridge at the time was how to make your car road legal. If you pick some random motor and build your own inverter you can end up spending a lot of time and money testing to get the car approved and road legal.</p>

<p>The next development was that big car manufacturers like: Nissan, VolksWagen and Tesla started making electric cars, and those electric costs were crashing. <strong>With this, we have available high quality parts. Those parts are road legal qualified motors. This means that one of the main blockers for car conversions has been lifted! A massive win!</strong> With all the legal issues gone this is a big push for recycling and making conversions easier.</p>

<h2 id="these-oem-parts-are-from-hybrid-electric-only-or-both">These OEM parts are from hybrid, electric only, or both?</h2>

<p>It can be from any of them. We started with a few electric components. The first was an OEM drive chain of a Tesla.  Nowadays we are looking into hybrids more because it’s so much cheaper. If you go out and buy a Tesla part, it will set you back by about 5000 euros. If you go out and buy a somewhat equivalent hybrid drive, you can get it for about 200, 300 euros. Another large barrier to EV conversions removed.</p>

<h2 id="i-get-the-sense-that-youre-really-into-democratising-this-is-that-so">I get the sense that you’re really into democratising this. Is that so?</h2>

<p>Most definetly! I was inspired by the Steve Jobs biography and some articles where they describe how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wosniak</a> worked. For example when he got a $100 per part, he didn’t use all the budget on it. He shrunk the design to the very essence of what was necessary.</p>

<p>What I aim for is: <strong>not much there that doesn’t need to be there</strong>. I do not use expensive components because of fancy data sheets. Do not use many components that are supposedly superior. What’s the point in measuring the current with 0.1% accuracy If all you need is like 5% .</p>

<h2 id="so-that-gets-us-to-the-last-few-years-what-has-been-happening">So that gets us to the last few years, what has been happening?</h2>

<p>In 2016 I registered the domain for <a href="http://coders4climatestrike.com/2020/07/openinverter.org">Open Inverter</a>. The idea was to create a platform for this ecosystem.  Not much happened for two years, but then a guy called Demare Deokman from Canada suggested we make a forum. We also added a Wiki and a shop. Before that people had to email me to request the different parts.</p>

<p>Then I started the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/openinverter">patreon page</a>, so that people could support my “artisanal engineering” work.  I hope it might become self-sustaining soon. If that happens I can spend all my time on this improving on the hardware and software.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-people-order-a-part-from-open-inverter">What happens when people order a part from Open Inverter?</h2>

<p>The process starts with getting the correct parts ordered, then I put it together, load the software to it, do some test procedures.I try to be as complete as possible, so people don’t have to go out and shop for something else when they get the kits. Follow the link for more info on the features of the <a href="http://johanneshuebner.com/quickcms/index.html%3Fen_features,8.html">Inverter Kit</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-blocker-for-more-car-conversions-to-electric">What is the blocker for more car conversions to electric?</h2>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Touran--electric-transaxle.jpg" width="400" alter="Touran conversion electric transaxle"></p>

<p>The main blocker is education. If you start off knowing nothing it’s hard to collect information. We’re trying to solve that, but it’s a long road. It would be ideal to know, given a car you want to convert: What parts would be suitable? What work needs to be done, What mechanical adaptations?</p>

<p>Deleting misinformation would be good too. There are a lot of rumors out there that might keep people from even thinking about doing a car conversion. Some examples are around lithium batteries and how their usage erases the environmental benefits of an EV.  Another one is more practical, on how to make sure your car conversions are road legal without huge costs.</p>

<p><img src="http://coders4climatestrike.com/img/2020-johannes/Touran--fossil-removal.jpg" width="400" alter="Touran conversion"></p>

<h2 id="since-you-are-enabling-car-conversions-do-you-have-it-in-your-plans-to-create-a-car-conversion-company">Since you are enabling car conversions, do you have it in your plans to create a car conversion company?</h2>

<p><strong>I wouldn’t. I see my work more like an ISO layer. It would be great if my work could enable others to run such a business.</strong> I think car conversions will eventually become more mainstream than they currently are. There are a lot of conversion shops in Germany but they have to charge ridiculous money to get the job done, it’s such custom work.</p>

<p>Every car is a new project. Standardising the conversions would make sense because it has certain advantages over buying a new electric car: the environmental impact is lower, parts already exist, also, you can customise certain aspects of the car to suit your needs better.  <strong>There are some very good chassis out there, that just have the wrong engine</strong></p>

<h2 id="speaking-of-debunking-myths-is-it-expected-that-i-would-lose-the-back-seats-if-i-convert-a-car">Speaking of debunking myths, is it expected that I would lose the back seats if I convert a car?</h2>

<p>Maybe that would have been true with my first conversion many years ago, the <a href="http://johanneshuebner.com/quickcms/index.html%3Fen_electric-car-conversion,6.html">92 Polo</a>, the battery weighted 250 kilograms. However, with nowadays technology I could probably fit most of the batteries in front and wouldn’t lose them.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-interesting-integration-plans-for-open-inverter">Are there any interesting integration plans for Open Inverter?</h2>

<p>It is in the plans to have some sort of standard so that other systems, like Open Vehicles can use the information Open Inverter provides such as motor temperature, motor speed, etc. This is a significant amount of work but I think it would be very useful</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Many people, including me, have been using gradient boosting machine (GBM), one of the most popular and powerful machine learning algorithms, to solve machine learning problems without knowing exactly what is going on underneath.</p>



<p>In this article, I will elucidate all the mathematics behind without leaving anything ambiguous.</p>

<h3 id="problem-definition">Problem Definition</h3>

<p>Most of the machine learning problems, including classification and regression problems, could be modeled as</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{x}$ and $y$ are features and label respectively, $L$ is the loss function, $F$ is a function which represents the model, and $F^{\ast}$ is the optimized function.</p>

<h3 id="gradient-descent">Gradient Descent</h3>

<h4 id="parameter-space">Parameter Space</h4>

<p>Suppose $F$ is a parameterized model with parameters $\mathbf{P}$,  $F(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{P})$, our optimization goal becomes equivalent to</p>



<p>where</p>



<p>and the optimal model is</p>



<p>We apply gradient descent to optimize the parameters $\mathbf{P}$. Suppose at time step $t-1$, the value of the parameters are $\mathbf{P}_{t-1}$. The gradient of the parameters, $\mathbf{g}_t$, is computed as follows.</p>



<p>where $j$ is the index of the parameter in the model.</p>



<p>The updated parameters at time step $t$ will become</p>



<p>where</p>



<p>Here ${\rho}_{t}$ is a scalar. Usually in machine learning, ${\rho}_{t}$ is arbitrary and is not optimal. To reach good optimization performance, we do linear search for ${\rho}_{t}$, i.e.,</p>



<p>Because ${\rho}_{t}$ is a scalar, so it could not make all the parameters in $\mathbf{P}$ to reach optimal values in one step. To optimize the parameters, we would have to do multiple steps to update. If we unroll the time-series updates, we would have</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{P}_{0}$ is the initialized parameters at time step $0$.</p>

<h4 id="function-space">Function Space</h4>

<p>In stead of doing optimization in parameter space, we could also do optimization in function space. We consider $F(\mathbf{x})$, i.e., the value of function $F$ evaluated at point $\mathbf{x}$, as the parameter to optimize.</p>



<p>Our objective function is</p>



<p>and we define</p>



<p>We assume function $F$ has no constrains, i.e., for any $\mathbf{x}$, $F(\mathbf{x})$ could be any value. Minimizing the above objective function is equivalent to minimizing ${\phi}(F(\mathbf{x}))$ for each $\mathbf{x}$ in the integral interval. Usually, there are infinite number of $\mathbf{x}$, and it is impossible to minimize ${\phi}(F(\mathbf{x}))$ for all $\mathbf{x}$. However, in practice, our training data is finite, so we could do this.</p>



<p>Suppose our training set consists of $N$ data points ${ \mathbf{x} ,y }_{1}^{N}$, the function $F$ could be represented as a discrete function</p>



<p>if $\mathbf{x}$ does not exist in the training data, $F(\mathbf{x})$ is undefined and it could be any value. Also note that $F$ does not have to be differentiable with respect to $\mathbf{x}$.</p>



<p>For each $\mathbf{x}$ from the training set, We compute the derivative of ${\phi}(F(\mathbf{x}))$ with respect to $F(\mathbf{x})$,</p>



<p>So similarly,</p>



<p>We apply gradient descent to optimize $F$. Suppose at time step $t-1$, the value of the parameters are $F_{t-1}$. The gradient of the parameters, $g_t$, is computed as follows.</p>







<p>where</p>



<p>So the updated function $F$ becomes</p>



<p>Similarly, the value of ${\rho}_{t}$ is determined by linear search,</p>



<p>Note that because each data point $\mathbf{x}_i$ in the dataset only has one label $y_i$, i.e., $P(y_i | \mathbf{x}_i) = 1$,</p>



<p>The most frequently used loss function for regression is L2 loss.</p>



<p>The $g_t(\mathbf{x}_i)$ expression for L2 loss becomes</p>



<h3 id="gradient-boosting-machine">Gradient Boosting Machine</h3>

<h4 id="theory">Theory</h4>

<p>As we have pointed out, the optimization in functional space directly tunes the value of $F(\mathbf{x})$, and the optimization for $F(\mathbf{x})$ does not dependent on the training data points other than $\mathbf{x}$. So $F$ would be very likely not to generalize well to the data points that have not been shown in the training set.</p>



<p>If we could impose smoothness to $F$ by introducing nearby data points when tuning the value of $F(\mathbf{x})$, $F$ is likely to generalize better.</p>



<p>So instead of updating $F$ using discrete function $g$ which has no smoothness at all, we use another smooth function $h$ such that $h(\mathbf{x})$ is close to $g(\mathbf{x})$ for $x \in {{\mathbf{x}_{i}}}_{1}^{N}$. In order to make $h$ smooth, we need to use all the data points from training set ${{\mathbf{x}_{i}}}_{1}^{N}$ to fit the parameters for $h$.</p>



<p>Concretely, we create a new model $h(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{a}_t)$ at each time step $t$. The update of function $F$ becomes</p>



<p>Because $h(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{a}_t)$ is a smoothing version of $-g_{t}(\mathbf{x})$, therefore, we use $(\mathbf{x}_i, g_{t}(\mathbf{x}_i))$, $x \in {{\mathbf{x}_{i}}}_{1}^{N}$, as the train set to fit $h(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{a}_t)$ using L2 loss.</p>



<p>Note that $h(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{a}_t)$ is parameterized and smoothed by fitting using all data points from the train set. Sometimes, $-g_t(\mathbf{x}_i)$ is also denoted as $\tilde{y}_i$, and $\tilde{y}_i$ is called “pseudo-response”.</p>



<p>The constant $\rho_t$ could be computed using linear search.</p>



<p>Therefore, gradient boosting machine is nothing special but using a parametric smoothing function $h(\mathbf{x}_i; \mathbf{a}_t))$ to replace the discrete non-parametric gradient function $g_t(\mathbf{x})$ during the machine learning optimization in the function space. In each time step, we introduce a new model, which is called “boost”.</p>

        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It has been few years now that .NET have added <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-jit-finally-proposed-jit-and-simd-are-getting-married/">SIMD support</a>. Last year, in .NET Core 3.0, a new feature <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/hardware-intrinsics-in-net-core/">“hardware intrinsics”</a> was introduced. This feature gives access to various vectorized and non-vectorized hardware instructions that modern hardware support. .NET developers can access these instructions using set of APIs under namespace <code>System.Runtime.Intrinsics</code> (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotNet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics?view=net-5.0">msdn</a>) and <code>System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86</code> (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86?view=net-5.0">msdn</a>) for Intel x86/x64 architecture. In .NET Core 5.0, APIs are added under <code>System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Arm</code> (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.arm?view=net-5.0">msdn</a>) for ARM architecture.</p>

<p><code>Vector64&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>Vector128&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code> data types represent vectorized data of size 64, 128 and 256 bits respectively and are the ones on which majority of these intrinsic APIs operate on. <code>Vector128&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code> are used for Intel instructions while <code>Vector64&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Vector128&lt;T&gt;</code> operates on ARM instructions.</p>

<p>For new .NET developer, it can be challenging to understand the underlying concept on top of which these APIs are built, especially if they have never worked on “Single instruction, multiple data” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a>). I faced those challenges too. This post will explain these .NET SIMD datatypes and then give example usage of each .NET API present on them. Since the usage can be easily seen on MSDN, I will also provide the outcome that can be accomplished by each API which will make it easier to grasp their intent. I will mostly focus on <code>Vector64&lt;T&gt;</code> APIs (and sometimes <code>Vector128&lt;T&gt;</code>) but it should be also applicable for <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3 id="vector128">Vector128</h3>

<p><code>Vector128</code> datatype holds data of 128 bits. You can interpret those 128 bits as 16 8-bits, 8 16-bits 4 32-bits, or 2 64-bits value. Below is the pictorial representation.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <code>V19</code> above is a register to demonstrate how they are represented in disassembly of ARM64.</p>

<h3 id="data-representation">Data representation</h3>

<p>Let us understand how the data is interpreted in various data types. We will take an example of <code>Vector64</code> but is applicable to <code>Vector128</code> as well.
Suppose you are operating on 8 1-byte data <code>&lt;11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18&gt;</code> . Let us see how they are stored in binary format.</p>

<pre><code>lane:     0           1         2          3         4           5          6          7 
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      | 00001011 | 00001100 | 00001101 | 00001110 | 00001111 | 00010000 | 00010001 | 00010010 | 
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data:     11          12        13         14          15         16         17         18 
</code></pre>

<p>However, same data can be interpreted in 4 16-bits as <code>&lt;3083, 3597, 4111, 4625&gt;</code>. Note that value <code>00001011</code> and <code>00001100</code> above at index <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> respectively are combined below to <code>00001100 00001011</code> at index <code>0</code>.</p>

<pre><code>lane:          0                  1                   2                 3          
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      | 0000110000001011 | 0000111000001101 | 0001000000001111 | 0001001000010001  | 
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data:          3083              3597                4111              4625 
</code></pre>

<p>Next, it can be interpreted as 2 32-bits to get <code>&lt;235736075, 303108111&gt;</code>.</p>

<pre><code>lane:                  0                                  1
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      | 00001110000011010000110000001011 | 00010010000100010001000000001111 |
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
data:               235736075                           303108111
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, it will be <code>&lt;1301839424133073931&gt;</code> if interpreted as 1 64-bits value.</p>

<pre><code>lane:                                 0
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
      | 0001001000010001000100000000111100001110000011010000110000001011 |
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
data:                          1301839424133073931
</code></pre>

<p>As seen above, in SIMD nomenclature, <code>lane</code> is often used as an alternative to <code>index</code> of an element inside the vector.</p>

<h3 id="apis-examples">APIs examples</h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><article><p>A few years ago I splurged on an exercise bike. It’s a pretty expensive
item imho, both in upfront and ongoing subscription costs. But I was able
to justify it by riding it all the time so that per-ride it wasn’t that
expensive. I’m happy to say this was a huge boon for my fitness and it
was worth every penny.</p><p>The bike is the Flywheel Home Bike by Flywheel Sports. You open up the app,
pick a class, and start riding. The app shows you a live video stream of an
instructor, your position on the leaderboard so you can compete with the
other people in the class, and your realtime stats like power (watts) and
cadence (rpm). There’s all the usual motivational badges that come with
fitness apps these days, and each ride is logged so you can track your
progress over time.</p><p>Or, that’s how it used to work anyway.</p><p>Flywheel recently and abruptly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144268/flywheel-digital-classes-shut-down-peloton-exercise-trade-in">shut down</a> the Home Bike service following a legal battle with their competitor, Peloton. The bike does still work in that you can still pedal and adjust the resistance and technically get a workout. But the app is no longer so there are no classes, no competition, and no stats.</p><p>Flywheel customers left wanting a bit more had a few options:</p><ol><li>Swap it for a free refurbished Peloton. Join Peloton for the same monthly fee and take their classes instead. Not a bad deal and arguably an upgrade.</li><li>Use the free <a href="https://lifefitness.com/icg-digital-experience/training-app">LifeFitness ICG Training App</a>. The Flywheel Home Bike is a rebranded LifeFitness IC5 so it just happens to work with this app. This gives you live stats like power and cadence and the ability to track your progress but doesn’t provide any live classes or competition, nor is it officially supported.</li><li>Add a set of power meter pedals ($). Use the bike with the massively-multiplayer online cycling simulator <a href="https://www.zwift.com/">Zwift</a> and other training apps.</li><li>Reverse engineer the bike. Set its data free to be used with Zwift and other training apps. No power meter pedals required.</li></ol><p>The rest of the post is a walk-through of my experience writing some code that enables the Flywheel Home Bike to work with Zwift and other training apps. It likely also works for the LifeFitness IC5 and support for other bikes should be easy to add.</p><p>The finished program is called <a href="https://github.com/ptx2/gymnasticon">Gymnasticon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ptx2/gymnasticon">the code</a> is open-source on GitHub.</p><h3 id="project-goals">Project goals</h3><p>The primary goal is to make the Flywheel Home Bike work with Zwift. It would be great if it also works with other cycling apps like TrainerRoad and Rouvy.</p><p>The solution should be easy to use for a non-developer and non-destructive to the bike.</p><p>The plan to get there is broken down into 3 parts:</p><ol><li>Write some code to get power and cadence data out of the bike’s proprietary protocol</li><li>Write some code to send power and cadence data to Zwift emulating a Bluetooth bike</li><li>Put the two together into a final working solution</li></ol><h3 id="part-1---getting-data-out-of-the-bike">Part 1 - Getting data out of the bike</h3><p>Only two pieces of information are needed to make a bike work with Zwift: power (watts) and cadence (rpm). Power enables Zwift to calculate your speed and position in the game. Cadence improves the experience of cadence-based workouts and enables Zwift to accurately animate your character.</p><p>We know from experience that this bike is capable of producing that information and that it communicates with the official Flywheel app using Bluetooth so the first step
is to open up a Bluetooth service explorer and see what’s available.</p><figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" src="https://ptx2.net/posts/unbricking-a-bike-with-a-raspberry-pi/videos/clip4_bluetility.mp4" alt="Bluetility on macOS shows the services offered by the Flywheel Home Bike." width="100%"></video><figcaption><p><a href="https://github.com/jnross/Bluetility">Bluetility</a> on macOS shows the services offered by the Flywheel Home Bike.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The bike advertises a single service with two characteristics (aka data values). A web
search for the service UUID tells us this is <a href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/include/bluetooth/services/nus.html">Nordic UART Service</a> which
is a custom service defined by Nordic Semiconductor. It allows sending
arbitrary data back and forth, emulating a serial port.</p><p>The characteristics are named from the bike’s perspective. To transmit
data to the bike we write to the receive (RX) characteristic. To receive data
from the bike we subscribe to the transmit (TX) characteristic.</p><p>Clicking subscribe on the (TX) characteristic shows that the bike is already sending some data. It is a bit hard to see the data here though. The short JavaScript program below uses the <a href="https://github.com/abandonware/noble">noble</a> Bluetooth client library to connect to the bike and dump all the received data to the console so we can begin to analyze it.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>/**

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

API handlers (think <code>http.Handler</code>), include a <code>context.Context</code> tied to the connectivity of the caller. If the client disconnects, the context closes, signaling to the handler that it can fail early and clean itself up. Importantly, the handler function returning <em>also</em> cancels the context.</p> <p>But what if you want to do an out-of-band operation after the request is complete? Like shadowing a new implementation or emitting analytics data that isn’t cheap enough to send inline? Perhaps there are some <a href="https://blog.golang.org/context">request-scoped values</a> attached to the context necessary to perform these operations.</p> <p>A straightforward solution might be to create a new context and attach used values. Copying works if the application owns those key-value pairs, and they are enumerable. But it should feel rickety. And, in the case of shadowing, this is an assumption that’s different than the actual implementation. Is there a better way?</p> <h2 id="the-situation">The Situation</h2> <p>OK, so we’ve got an HTTP endpoint that <em>does something</em>, and we’re testing out a new implementation that we think is better. We want to ensure that’s the case (via metrics and other heuristics), and we want to verify that, given real production data, it has the same behavior. Instead of doing this sequentially with the actual request, which would add to its latency, we instead choose to do it concurrently in a goroutine:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>Handle</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>req</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Satisfied with the approach, we push this code to production and gleefully await the data. Unfortunately, the data indicate that the new implementation often mismatches, returning an error (<code>context.Canceled</code>) instead of the expected output. What gives?</p> <blockquote> <p>For incoming server requests, the context is canceled when the client’s connection closes, the request is canceled (with HTTP/2), or when the ServeHTTP method returns. <cite><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request.Context">http.Request.Context</a></cite></p> </blockquote> <p>In our case, while the <code>shadow</code> function is running concurrently, <code>Handle</code> may have finished writing the response and returned, which results in the <code>req.Context.Done</code> channel being closed. Anywhere the context is used past that point will result in the cancellation error. To understand how we can overcome this, we need to grok context’s design.</p> <h2 id="the-context-prototype-chain">The Context Prototype Chain</h2> <p>When creating a context, every single constructor requires a parent <code>context.Context</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>cancel</span> <span>:=</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>WithCancel</span><span>(</span><span>parent</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Under the hood, the new context composes around the parent, inheriting any pre-existing deadlines, cancellations, and key-value pairs. If the parent (or any other ancestor) is canceled or times out, the “doneness” is propagated down through the chain of child contexts, exposed via the <code>Done</code> and <code>Err</code> methods. The converse is false however: a canceled child context does not cancel its parent.</p> <p>Additionally, attaching values results in a new child context for each new key-value pair without mutating the parent. When calling <code>Value</code> on a context, it walks up the ancestor chain, checking each parent for the requested key. This pattern permits a child to overwrite a value without mucking up the parent or any other parallel chains sharing a similar root context. It also means that value lookups are <code>O(n)</code> and not <code>O(1)</code>, so be judicious in how many values you include in a context.</p>  <p>This construction is known as a <em>prototype chain</em>, where each “link” is a new context that refers to its predecessors to share and override the behavior. And we want to break that.</p> <h2 id="break-the-chain">Break The Chain</h2> <p>Well, not exactly. In our shadowing case, we still want access to any values on the parent context, but we want to disconnect the new code from the handler’s cancellations. Instead of breaking the chain (which is essentially creating a completely new one), we need to short-circuit the existing one’s behavior. We do this by forming a new context “link”:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// DisconnectContext returns a child context from parent that does not</span>
<span>// propagate cancellation or deadlines. Value pairs are still propagated.</span>
<span>func</span> <span>DisconnectContext</span><span>(</span><span>parent</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>{</span> <span>parent</span><span>:</span> <span>parent</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// disconnectedContext looks very similar to the unexported context.emptyCtx</span>
<span>// implementation from the standard library, with the exception of the parent's</span>
<span>// Value method being the only feature propagated.</span>
<span>type</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>parent</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Deadline will erase any actual deadline from the parent, returning ok==false</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>)</span> <span>Deadline</span><span>()</span> <span>(</span><span>deadline</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Time</span><span>,</span> <span>ok</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Done will stop propagation of the parent context's done channel. Receiving</span>
<span>// on a nil channel will block forever.</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>)</span> <span>Done</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;-</span><span>chan</span> <span>struct</span><span>{}</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Err will always return nil since there is no longer any cancellation</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>)</span> <span>Err</span><span>()</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Value behaves as normal, continuing up the chain to find a matching</span>
<span>// key-value pair.</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>)</span> <span>Value</span><span>(</span><span>key</span> <span>interface</span><span>{})</span> <span>interface</span><span>{}</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>ctx</span><span>.</span><span>parent</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The implementation is simple and effective; all methods return zero values. The only exception (<code>Value</code>) delegates to the parent. The <code>shadow</code> goroutine can now be modified to use this new helper:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>shadow</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>,</span> <span>input</span> <span>*</span><span>Input</span><span>,</span> <span>expectedOut</span> <span>*</span><span>Output</span><span>,</span> <span>expectedErr</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>// disconnect from the parent context chain</span>
	<span>ctx</span> <span>=</span> <span>DisconnectContext</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span>

	<span>// execute the new implementation wtih the same inputs</span>
	<span>newOut</span><span>,</span> <span>newErr</span> <span>:=</span> <span>DoSomethingBetter</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>input</span><span>)</span>

	<span>// &lt;snip&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>There we have it!</p> <h2 id="here-be-dragons">Here Be Dragons</h2> <p>I’d categorize this as dark arts: it breaks the fundamental contract of how contexts are supposed to work, and it is opaque to the rest of the stack. To mitigate this at work, our constructor requires a timeout to prevent the context from becoming a permanent zombie:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>DisconnectContext</span><span>(</span><span>parent</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>,</span> <span>timeout</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Duration</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>CancelFunc</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>ctx</span> <span>:=</span> <span>disconnectedContext</span><span>{</span><span>parent</span><span>:</span> <span>parent</span><span>}</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>WithTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>timeout</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Even so, this sort of foot-gun should give you the shivers. Breaking the context chain should be well documented and isolated from the main flow of the application (if possible). Ideally, I encourage exploring other strategies, especially if this behavior will be more than temporary.</p> <p>For example, is there a better way to get shadowing?</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Have the networking layer do the work for you.</strong> If your service has a configurable proxy in front of it, such as Envoy, you can <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-msg-route-routeaction-requestmirrorpolicy">mirror traffic</a>. Mirroring allows testing a new implementation in isolation alongside the existing one without impacting the downstream client. While more operationally intensive, this will more closely match the real behavior of the application flow and not muddy handler code with shadowing logic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Make it in-your-face.</strong> Right now, the shadowing behavior is ad-hoc, but using an experimentation library, like GitHub’s <a href="https://github.com/github/scientist">scientist</a>, will make the shadowing explicit and structured in the code. A tool like this might come with builtin statistics and tracing to validate the results.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Control it with feature flags.</strong> Feature flag tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/vsco/dcdr">dcdr</a>, are not exactly a separate strategy, but more of a recommendation. When introducing a new code path, you may not want to expose all traffic to it simultaneously. A subset of all traffic is often enough to vet experiments. By leveraging feature flags, the shadowing can begin in the “off” state, and then slowly ramped up to increasing percentages of the incoming requests.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All-in-all, while I wouldn’t call breaking the chain a <em>good</em> pattern, it can be useful in this context (heh), and other valid use cases surely exist.</p> </section>  </article>  </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

<p>You’ve probably heard the word eigenvectors hundreds of times in class and have been asked to calculate it hundreds more. But why is this concept so central in Linear Algebra? Why is it that we study the eigenvector of a matrix so often?</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll see how Eigenvectors help us immediately understand what a linear function will do to an input. We’ll do so by playing with an interactive visualization that allows us to see just that.</p>

<h3 id="quick-refresher">Quick Refresher</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_scaling.png" width="300">
    Here, applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on its eigenvector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> leades to a new vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is in the same direction as <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Image Source: Wikipedia.
</p>

<p>Let’s do a quick refresher to begin with. The eigenvector of a linear function A is just the vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> s.t. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Av = \lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constant <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which we call the eigenvalue. At a high level, the eigenvector is just a dimension along which the linear function only stretches its input (for real valued eigenvalues).</p>

<p>This is great and all but what can we do once we find an Eigenvector? What does it tell us about the underlying Matrix?</p>

<h3 id="linear-functions-pull-inputs-towards-the-dominant-eigenvector">Linear Functions Pull Inputs Towards the Dominant Eigenvector</h3>

<p>Let’s start with an example. Take the following linear function:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> repeatedly on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>


    
    
    




<p>To play with this visualization, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
  <li>Notice how the output vector tilts towards <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So just by knowing an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (namely the dominant eigenvector), we can get a sense of what <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> does -  <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <strong>pulls</strong> its input towards the axis of the dominant eigenvector.</p>

<p>How is this happening? And why is it only towards one eigenvector?</p>

<h3 id="breaking-up-the-input-with-an-eigenbasis">Breaking Up the Input With an Eigenbasis</h3>

<p>You’ll be surprised to see that this behavior comes very naturally from the properties of linear functions.  Let’s see this with an example.</p>

<p>Let’s keep the same matrix/linear function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and analyze applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> three times on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/standard_flow.png">
    In the standard way, we'd just use standard matrix multiplication to find <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>The standard way to do this is to simply follow the rules of multiplication and carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>v</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A(A(A(v))).</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> But instead, let’s do this a different way using eigenvectors.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split_flow.png">
    In the following discussion we will split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into a linear combination of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>'s eigenvectors. We then apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to each of these pieces and combine the result.
</p>

<p>We know that that any vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be written as the sum of the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. After all, eigenvectors are linearly independent and form a basis for the space (if the matrix <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is diagonalizable, which it is). If <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A,</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> we can break up <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as:</p>

<p><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = c_1 \cdot v_1 + c_2 \cdot v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constants <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split.png">
    We first split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into its eigenvector subcomponents.

<h3 id="dominant-eignevalues-and-eigenvectors">Dominant Eignevalues and Eigenvectors</h3>

<p>Now, what happens when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is larger than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. there exists a dominant eigenvalue)? In this example, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1 = 5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2 = 2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Let’s now display what it would look like to carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> when we have this difference in eigenvalues.</p>

<p>The interaction below shows this setup:</p>




    
    
    




<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase or decrease the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
  <li>Notice how “Output Eigenvector 1” and “Output Eigenvector 2” change at different rates.</li>
  <li>Notice how “Final Output Vector” tilts towards “Output Eigenvector 1” as you drag the slider to the right.</li>
</ol>

<p>We thus see that when there’s one eigenvalue larger than the other (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1 &gt; \lambda_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), the linear function pushes its inputs towards the eigenvector associated with that large eigenvalue (“Output EigenVector One”). The more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the larger this effect.</p>

<p>Note this “push” effect will only happen towards this eigenvector with the largest eignevalue - not any of the other eigenvectors.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-happens">Why this happens</h3>

<p>This tilt towards “Output Vector One” happens due to exponential growth. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> grows much faster than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. As such the more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in our exponentials), the bigger the difference between <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Hence the <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> term has much more weight in the final sum. This increasing difference is shown in the plot below.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/exponentials.png">
    Due to the power of exponentials, the dominant eigenvector will play a bigger and bigger role the more times we apply A. Notice how the distance between the two expontial functions increases with x.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, just using the properties of linear functions, we are able to see why eigenvectors are so important. They show us where a linear function will “push” its inputs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><h3>

<span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> is a uniquely simple way of programming computers. It is particularly suited to the multi-computer chips of <span color="green">GreenArrays</span>. How simple it is:

</h3><h2>Words</h2>
<span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> uses words much as English does. (A <em>word</em> can be a subroutine, if that helps.) A <em>word</em> is a string of lower-case characters (from a set of 48) ending with space. The character @ is pronounced <em>fetch</em> and fetches a number from some address. Likewise, ! (<em>store</em>) stores a number. Some words:<ul><span color="green">
   <li>and or drop dup over push pop
   </li><li>for next unext -if if then
   </li><li>; @ ! @+ !+ @b !b @p !p
   </li><li>+ . +* 2* 2/ - b! a!
   </li></span><li><span color="green">12345 -1 144 0</span></li></ul>   

<p>If you type a <span color="#a0a000">word</span>, the computer will perform some action. For example</p><ul>
   <li><span color="#a0a000">on</span></li></ul>
might turn on a light.

<h2>Numbers</h2>
Words that look like numbers are placed on a push-down stack (like a stack of dishes). @ also puts numbers on the stack. There they serve as arguments for later words:<ul>
   <span color="green"><li>1000 ms
   </li></span><li><span color="green">3 !</span></li></ul>


<h2>Definitions</h2>
New words are defined in terms of old:<ul>
   <li><span color="red">toggle <span color="green">on 1000 ms off ;</span></span></li></ul>
The red word is defined by the following green words. When you type <span color="#a0a000">toggle</span>, the light is turned on, the computer waits 1000 ms (milliseconds) then turns it off. Semicolon marks the end of this word (return from subroutine).

<p>Other words:</p><ul>
   <li><span color="red">on <span color="green">3 ! ;</span></span>
   </li><li><span color="red">off <span color="green">2 ! ;</span></span></li></ul>
Here a number is stored into a register to change an output.

<h2>Loops</h2>
Computers are good at repetition. Here's one way to define a loop:<ul>
   <li><span color="red">ms <span color="green">for 1ms next ;</span></span></li></ul>
The word <span color="green">for</span> expects an argument and puts it into a counter. The word <span color="green">next</span> returns to <span color="green">for</span> that many times. The word <span color="green">1ms</span> waits 1 millisecond.

<h2>Conditions</h2>
Computers sometimes need to make decisions:<ul>
   <li><span color="red">abs <span color="green">-if - 1 + then ;</span></span></li></ul>
<span color="green">abs </span>will return the absolute value of its argument. If it is negative, <span color="green">-if</span> does a ones-complement and adds 1. If it is not negative (positive or 0) <span color="green">-if</span> jumps to <span color="green"> then</span> and does nothing.

<h2>Compiler</h2>
<span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> compiles source code into machine instructions, which can then be executed. It uses color to indicate the function of a word:<ul>
   <li><span color="#a0a000">Yellow</span> - a word to be executed
   </li><li><span color="red">Red</span> - a word being defined
   </li><li><span color="green">Green</span> - a word to be compiled as part of a definition
   </li><li>White (or black) - a comment to be ignored</li></ul>
Color aids understanding, avoids syntax and simplifies the compiler.

<p>The compiler reads words from text stored in memory. A special editor manages this text. <span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> code is exceptionally compact.

</p><h2>Program</h2>
A program in <span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> is a collection of simple words that describe a task. Although definitions can be long and complicated, that is not wise. A larger number of simpler words is easier to read, write, debug and document.

<p>The computer begs fallible programmers: Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS). <span color="red">color<span color="green">Forth</span></span> helps.</p></div>]]>

I did a few bits and pieces of jobs in London and traveled in Asia before finally ending up in Budapest where I live now as an expat.</p><p>I started a business to help match language teachers with students. It was born out of me trying to be a language teacher, realizing I wasn't very good at it but found I was pretty good at finding students and being able to link them with other teachers. I built a website for that, and that was <a href="https://www.weareteacherfinder.com/">Teacher Finder</a>. It had some success and then it started to decline. Because of that, I needed to search for new work. <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> was one of the tools I've learned to use when building Teacher Finder to automate parts of it. When I found myself with more time, I started freelancing using Zapier. It developed into my current business, an agency called <a href="https://www.luhhu.com/">Luhhu</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://luhhu.com/"><div><p>Luhhu | Zapier Certified Experts</p><p>We help people automate their business with Zapier.</p><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5cadfb01ef329c01f3f582bd/5cadfca2a8cff783ba4c6b3b_Favicon.jpg"><span>We're Zapier Certified Experts</span></p></div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5cadfb01ef329c01f3f582bd/5ec7dccd0a860f2afb6d1de0_Screen%20Shot%202020-05-22%20at%2016.07.54.png"></p></a></figure><h3 id="how-did-you-come-up-with-the-idea-to-build-it-what-was-the-main-motivation-behind-it">How did you come up with the idea to build it? What was the main motivation behind it?</h3><p>I thought I could teach English. I didn't have any qualifications. But people would probably want to speak to a native speaker.</p><p>I had a little bit of success, but I didn't enjoy teaching. I had a bit of experience with SEO and I could build a half-decent website. When I started to get inquiries of people looking for a teacher, I started referring them on to other teachers I knew and I realized there could be a business here. I would refer the leads on and I would get a small referral fee. I built the website out a bit, and I put profiles on there. I started thinking about other cities in Europe like Berlin, Madrid, Barcelona, where people would be looking for teachers.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-build-the-platform">How did you build the platform?</h3><p>I built the original website in WordPress. Right at the very start, it was a WordPress website and a Gravity form. A big Google Sheet was running the whole operation, and Zapier automated the process of matching up teachers, getting updates from them, and sorting out payments. After some time, I migrated away from that Google Sheet and built a custom backend using Bubble.</p><figure><img src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/teacherfinder.PNG" alt="teacher-finder-homepage" srcset="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/teacherfinder.PNG 600w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/teacherfinder.PNG 1000w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/teacherfinder.PNG 1600w, https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/teacherfinder.PNG 1766w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Teacher Finder Homepage</figcaption></figure><p>We were constantly battling in some cities. There were loads of teachers, but not too many people looking for teachers, or at least not looking online for them. The reverse happened in some cities. In Germany, we always had plenty of German teachers and English teachers, but we had a surprising amount of demand for Spanish teachers. We didn't have many teachers. In Hamburg or Munich, we came to find there were only two or three really good, full time working private teachers. But they had more students than they could handle. We had a lot of students contacting us we simply couldn't help. It was very hard to scale. In some cities, we will try to bring in more demand and in some cities trying to manage more supply. Keeping that seesaw balance was difficult.</p><h3 id="what-channels-did-you-use-to-find-students-and-teachers">What channels did you use to find students and teachers?</h3><p>We didn't do too much in terms of finding students. We didn't do too much outbound marketing. We had blog content. I think we crept up on Google search. Someone searching German teacher in Berlin would probably find us in the top listings. We never had problems finding students. In terms of teachers, my partner spent a lot of time in message boards for expats in different cities posting, looking for people posting about being teachers, and posting about work. We would go to other teacher listing sites, contact people through there, and try to recruit them. It was a lot of hustle looking around anywhere where expats or language teachers were congregated online, and just messaging them finding out if they had availability and convincing them to sign up.</p><h3 id="what-were-your-biggest-challenges-you-had-to-overcome">What were your biggest challenges you had to overcome?</h3><p>We got to a point where we had a nice balance in enough cities to bring in enough money. It was always a little bit difficult. We had a pricing model where teachers paid us a fee, once they've had four successful lessons. If a student dropped out before that we wouldn't charge the teacher. We'd only charge a one-off fee. We weren't taking a percentage of their earnings, which I think teachers liked, but we had to constantly get updates from teachers. As that scaled, it became a labor-intensive process of chasing up teachers, getting updates, sending them invoices, getting payments. It was difficult to automate that.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-realize-the-project-was-not-going-in-the-right-direction">How did you realize the project was not going in the right direction?</h3><p>We started in Budapest and we launched internationally at the end of 2015. For the first two years, it was good. We were getting more traffic to the website, more inquiries from students. We were making more successful matches, we were learning, and doing well in cities.</p><p>Early 2018 it peaked, but then it plateaued and then started to decline. We were getting less traffic, fewer inquiries. We noticed there were other apps and websites doing similar things. We were competing for spots with Google. Where we had been number one for a particular search in a city, we were dropping down to two or three. That was translating into fewer inquiries. We thought about how much energy we put in to get these top spots in cities and realized it had translated into not so many students, and not that many teachers. There was no way we could create new German, French, or English teachers. There was only a limited amount of demand for finding teachers. We estimated we'd probably hit that in most cities. It was bringing in $3,000-$5,000 a month, which was good, but we realized you couldn't build a big business off that. If that was the peak, then it wasn't going to be a project that was going to last forever.</p><h3 id="what-is-the-current-state-of-the-project">What is the current state of the project?</h3><p>At the end of last year, we were in 60-70 cities. We found out only about 20 of those were doing matches. We stripped back to 10 European cities, and we concentrated on core languages like English, German, and French. It took a lot of the workload away. We've used Zapier to automate every tiny little bit of the business we could. It's turned into a business that takes a few hours to run a month. It's making anywhere between $500-$1,000/month. I still enjoy the fact that we're helping a select number of teachers find work in their cities.</p><h3 id="did-you-achieve-any-revenue-in-the-end-how-much-money-did-you-lose">Did you achieve any revenue? In the end, how much money did you lose?</h3><p>We made £67,000 in total since March 2016. At peak, we were paying for a bunch of apps, Google AdWords and other stuff. We were always covering our costs, but we weren't having much profit left over to pay me and my partner.</p><p>We slashed every app we didn't need. We're just paying for Zapier, Xero and a couple of other things. In the last couple of years, the running costs have been less than $100 a month. It's quite profitable even though that chunk of profit doesn't add up too much. </p><blockquote>We split that and it keeps us both motivated to keep this going.</blockquote><h3 id="if-you-had-the-chance-to-start-over-again-what-would-you-do-in-a-different-way">If you had the chance to start over again, what would you do in a different way?</h3><p>I wouldn't do a marketplace business again. With my new business as an agency, we have a skill, we sell it, people pay for it. There's no managing a supply and demand side.</p><p>I would also have focused on online lessons. We focused on matching people that wanted language lessons in person. But there are lots of logistical issues there. In a big city, you might have a student in one part of town and a great teacher in the other. They might be a great match, but they're not going to travel for one hour to see each other. We weren't even covering a whole city. I’ll focus on a marketplace business where the supply and the demand was online, and there was no managing the logistics of that.</p><h3 id="from-all-your-takeaways-you-learned-from-this-experience-what-advice-do-you-have-for-other-entrepreneurs-who-want-to-get-started-or-are-just-starting-out">From all your takeaways you learned from this experience, what advice do you have for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?</h3><p>Just start and start simple. We started without automation. It was just me managing every request we got and finding teachers. </p><blockquote>Every business could be boiled down to something really simple. </blockquote><p>You're not going to lose any money building a business like that. You might not make any money but if you do, that’s a great situation to be in.</p><p>Keep your costs less than what you're earning. Don’t get into debt. Don't depend on the business. Build out the business by reinvesting your earnings. As you start to earn more, you can invest in more apps and more automation, but always keep it in perspective.</p><p>Think very carefully about marketplace businesses. Most people start these types of businesses because they've realized they've got a supply or demand for something and they just assume they’ll be able to match that up.

					<p>We all have to make significant code changes from time to time. Most of these code changes are large. Consider the scenario that you merged one such significant change, and then other team members made a few more changes on top. Then a major bug is detected. You desperately make the fix. It makes it in. You declare a victory, and a few hours later, your colleague notices another bug/crash/performance regression. Your commit cannot be reverted. It isn’t just about you. Many others have built on top of the change you made—the code sloths along in this broken state for a few days before you eventually fix it. Everyone has faced this issue at some point or the other.</p>
<p>If the code change is small, this is a non-issue, you can revert it and fix it at your own pace. Therefore, when making significant code changes, always try to do it in two different commits (pull requests). In the commit, you add the new code, add a switch (command-line flag or a constant) to turn it on, and keep that switch off by default. In the second commit, turn the switch on. Now, if there is a problem, you immediately turn the switch off and start working on a fix. No one else will deal with the broken code. It would be even better if the switch is a command-line flag since you can turn on the flag for 10% of the machines (or users) and see the behavior for a few days before rolling it out to 100%. It big teams, it is usually good to add a comment to switch mentioning when it should expire or else you will end with <a href="https://eng.uber.com/piranha/">Uber scale</a> problem.</p>
<p>There are a few cases where this cannot be done, for example, during big code refactoring. I think big code refactoring touching code written by multiple teams is almost rarely justified in a single commit.</p>
<p>Examples of some cases where this is useful</p>
<ol>
<li>Switching over from consuming data via v1 of some API to v2</li>
<li>Switching over from returning computed results to stored results (for faster response time but possibly inaccurate outcome)</li>
<li>Switching over from JSON to Protocol Buffer/Thrift</li>
<li>Switching over from VMs to Kubernetes (don’t delete the old code yet, you might regret it)</li>
</ol>

  <p>For HA and easier management of our containers we can create swarm cluster.<br>
It is composed of couple nodes with docker engine installed.</p>
<p>How to setup swarm and use it?</p>
<h3 id="example-configuration-and-prerequisites">Example configuration and prerequisites</h3>
<p>In my lab environment I used three nodes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Role in Swarm</th>
<th>Server</th>
<th>IP</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Manager</td>
<td>docker-host1.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker1</td>
<td>docker-host2.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker2</td>
<td>docker-host3.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each node has got docker engine installed with standard procedure as for single node docker.</p>
<p>Ports that are need to be open on each node:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TCP/UDP</th>
<th>Port</th>
<th>What is for?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>TCP</td>
<td>2377</td>
<td>cluster management</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TCP and UDP</td>
<td>7946</td>
<td>node communication</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UDP</td>
<td>4789</td>
<td>overlay network</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="create-swarm-cluster">Create swarm cluster</h2>
<p>Log in to manager node.</p>
<p>Most importatnt parameters for <code>docker swarm init</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--autolock</code> - <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> - enable autolock for manager node - more later in this post</li>
<li><code>--advertise-addr</code> - address for API and overlay networks for other cluster members</li>
<li><code>--listen-addr</code> - address for cluster management</li>
<li><code>--availability</code> - cloud be <code>active</code>(new tasks allowed), <code>pause</code>(new tasks not allowed, but old keeps going) or <code>drain</code>(new tasks not allowed, finish immediately old ones if they exists) - set drain for manager node to create manager without containers on it</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool</code> - by default <code>10.10.10.0/8</code> - we can set another address pool for overlay network created with cluster</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool-mask-len</code> - number on subnets that are allow to be created in <code>--default-addr-pool</code></li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>lukas@docker-host1 ~<span>]</span>$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.10.10.20 --listen-addr 10.10.10.20

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-0zwqchv43d2alvl99fgw2mh6cnv7xc8vakspd90yjh4i7eiwwx-cn32plktlwjf8q25azk37ij5v 10.10.10.20:2377

  </div>
  <p>Here’s how we’ve upped our audio game, and improved our video calls.</p>
<p>The Scale Factory was founded in 2009 as a remote-first organisation. It was a number of years before we took any office space, and so we’ve always been quite familiar with the tools of home working. With the global pandemic going on, this has become the norm for everyone now.</p>
<p>As a result, we’re doing a lot more Zoom meetings, both with our colleagues and with clients. We recently ran an internal discussion on how to improve the quality of these calls, and the general consensus is that although it’s fun to tinker with video tools like OBS, it’s much more important to get the audio right.</p>
<p>Since then, many of the team have spent some of their hardware budget on new audio equipment, and clients have responded very positively to the quality of our calls.</p>
<h2 id="the-basics">The basics</h2>
<p>There are two easy ways to immediately improve your video calls.</p>
<p>First of all, connect your computer to your router using a wired connection. Wifi is great for the majority of day to day computing tasks, but video calls are sensitive to changes in throughput and latency, and the best way to avoid those is to go wired.</p>
<p>Secondly, use a pair of headphones. When you’re on a call without headphones and someone at the other end of the connection is speaking, the volume on your microphone will be temporarily ducked in order to reduce the chance of echo. If you try and speak when other people are talking, parts of your sentences will cut out, making it hard for your listeners to understand. If you wear headphones, that echo cancellation isn’t necessary, and so you can have a more natural bi-directional conversation.</p>
<h2 id="microphones">Microphones</h2>
<p>Once you’ve solved for the basics, the next place to turn your attention is your microphone.</p>
<p>The main part of a microphone is an element that picks up vibrations in the air, and converts these to an electrical signal. There are a number of different types of microphone element, with some more common than others.</p>
<p><em>Dynamic</em> microphones work like a speaker in reverse: sound waves move a diaphragm, which in turn vibrates a coil within a magnetic field. This vibration induces an electrical audio signal in the wire.</p>
<p><em>Condenser</em> microphones use a pair of charged metal plates, one of which can be moved by a diaphragm. Sound waves thus change the capacitance of the two plates, which creates the audio signal. Condenser microphones need a power supply to work, and are a little less rugged than dynamic mics.</p>
<p>Your mobile phone probably has a <em>MEMS (Microelectromechanical System)</em> mic, in which a diaphragm is etched straight onto silicon.</p>
<p>Every microphone element has a number of different properties to consider. We’ll look a the most relevant here.</p>
<h3 id="frequency-response">Frequency Response</h3>
<p>Sound waves have a frequency range from 20 Hz (low pitch) to 20,000 Hz (high pitch).</p>
<p>The frequency response of a mic is the range of frequencies at which the mic is the most sensitive. Sound recording engineers will consider the frequency range of the sound source when choosing a mic to match it.</p>
<p>The human voice typically has a fundamental frequency from 85 Hz to 255 Hz, so for voice recording, we want to choose a microphone with good frequency response in that range.</p>

            <h4>Frequency Response Graph for a Shure SM57 Mic</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="directionality">Directionality</h3>
<p>Microphone directionality is the variation in sensitivity of a mic, relative to the angle the sound is coming from. This is sometimes referred to as a “polar pattern” after the graphs used to communicate this information like the ones below. In these graphs, the microphone is considered to be in the middle, pointing towards the 0° marker.</p>
<p>An <em>omnidirectional</em> microphone will pick up sound equally in all directions, which makes them great for picking up audio from a group - but they also pick up a lot of background noise.</p>
<figure>

            <h4>Polar Pattern for an Omnidirectional mic</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A <em>cardioid</em> or <em>unidirectional</em> mic picks up sound from the front, but will reject almost all sound from behind, which makes them great for picking up voice without any background interference.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.scalefactory.com/blog/2020/07/31/can-you-hear-me-i-can-hear-you/polar-pattern-cardioid.png"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Polar Pattern for a Cardioid mic</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mics can also be <em>bi-directional</em>, <em>hyper-cardioid</em> and <em>super-cardioid</em>, you’re less likely to use these for your video calls.</p>
<p>With an array of two or more microphones and some clever digital signal processing (DSP), you can do something called <em>beam forming</em> in order to isolate a sound source from a specific location relative to the mic. This is good for meeting rooms where different people might be speaking, or a room with general background noise.</p>
<h2 id="your-options">Your options</h2>
<h3 id="built-in-laptop-mics">Built-in laptop mics</h3>
<p>The mic in your laptop seems like an obvious first choice, but it’s also often a bad one. These are general purpose, omnidirectional, sensitive microphones. They’re designed to try and pick up as much nearby audio as possible. If you’re not in a quiet space, it’ll pick up a lot of background noise.</p>
<p>It’ll also pick up noise from the device itself. If you’re typing during the call, your listeners will hear the percussion of every key stroke, and the scratch of the touchpad, which is quite off-putting. Some of our team have Dell XPS laptops, and those mount the mic close to the CPU fan vent. If your laptop is working hard (as it will be if you’re sharing your screen), the fan noise will be clearly audible by everyone else on the call.</p>
<h3 id="headphones-with-built-in-mic">Headphones with built-in mic</h3>
<p>Another common option, particularly if you’ve followed my earlier advice and put on a pair of headphones, is to use the mic that’s built into these.</p>
<p>This is a better choice than your laptop’s mic. By design, they’re closer to your mouth and so don’t need to be quite so sensitive, so they’ll pick up less background noise. I use a pair of <a href="https://en-uk.sennheiser.com/momentum-wireless-headphones-with-mic">Sennheiser Momentum 2 Wireless</a> headphones, which uses two microphones and some beam forming DSP to isolate my voice from background noise.</p>
<p>If your headphones are connected by Bluetooth, you’ll be able to walk around the room whilst you’re chatting (I find that doing this, with video off, means I’m less susceptible to “Zoom Fatigue”), but there’s something to be aware of when using Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Bluetooth audio has two modes: one for listening to high quality audio, and one for both listening and speaking through the microphone. The quality of the audio you’ll send and receive will be lower if you’re using the built-mic on your Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<h3 id="conference-mic">Conference mic</h3>
<p>In the office, we have a <a href="https://www.jabra.co.uk/business/speakerphones/jabra-speak-series">Jabra Speak</a>, which is a microphone and speaker combo that looks a little like a hockey puck and connects either using Bluetooth or USB.</p>
<p>The Jabra is great for picking up multiple voices around a conference table, in a room with little other background noise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scalefactory.com/about/meet-team/steve-dodd/">Steve</a> uses a similar device during <a href="https://www.scalefactory.com/services/well-architected/">Well-Architected reviews</a>. It works for him because he has a dedicated office space at the bottom of his garden, so there’s usually not a lot of background noise.</p>
<h3 id="external-mic">External mic</h3>
<p>In terms of audio quality, this is by far the best option. Colleagues who’ve acquired an external mic now have a warm, smooth voice recording on every call.</p>
<p>Unless you plan to use your mic with anything other than your computer, I’d recommend buying something that connects via USB. That way connectivity, and power are both taken care of in one interference-free cable.</p>
<p>No doubt attributable to the rise of streamers, there are plenty of good options in this space.</p>
<p>I chose a <a href="https://www.marantzpro.com/products/view/mpm-2000u">Marantz Professional MPM-2000U</a>. It’s a studio-quality condenser microphone, with a cardioid polar pattern. It has to be quite close to my mouth when I speak which took a bit of getting used to, but it picks up very little background noise. I’ve hosted webinars with the dishwasher running nearby, unheard. <a href="https://www.scalefactory.com/about/meet-team/adam-christie/">Adam</a> picked up a <a href="https://www.marantzpro.com/products/view/mpm-1000u">Marantz Professional MPM-1000U</a> which is almost identical and a bit cheaper. If you’re buying Marantz be careful to select the USB model (check for the trailing ‘U’ in the model number), otherwise these won’t connect straight to your computer.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.scalefactory.com/blog/2020/07/31/can-you-hear-me-i-can-hear-you/MPM-2000U_Hero_HiRes_RGB.jpg"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Marantz Professional MPM-2000U Microphone</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A popular choice in the team, and favoured by streamers, is the <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti-nano/">Blue Yeti Nano</a>. This is also a USB-connected condenser mic, but this model contains two elements - one cardioid, one omnidirectional - so that you can choose between capturing one or multiple voices. It also has a mute button, and a headphones connector.</p>
<p>Blue also sell the more expensive <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti-x/">Yeti X</a> with a choice of 4 condenser elements, LED metering, and vocal effects; and the cheaper <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/snowball/">Snowball</a> if you’re on a budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scalefactory.com/about/meet-team/sandro-cirulli/">Sandro</a> chose a <a href="https://www.trust.com/en/product/22656-gxt-232-mantis-streaming-microphone">Trust GXT 232 Mantis</a>. Again, this connects via USB and provides an omnidirectional condenser element.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scalefactory.com/about/meet-team/tim-bannister/">Tim</a> went for a <a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/q2u/">Samson Q2U</a>. Unlike the other options here, the Q2U is a dynamic mic, and has both USB and XLR connectivity options, as well as a headphones connector, making it a good choice if you might have other use cases for a mic. It has a cardioid polar pattern, so you need to keep it pointed in the general direction of your face.</p>
<h2 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h2>
<h3 id="microphone-stand">Microphone Stand</h3>
<p>As well as the mic itself, you’ll need something to mount it on. The closer you can get the mic to your mouth, the better the recording.</p>
<p>I chose a <a href="https://www.trust.com/en/product/22563-gxt-253-emita-streaming-microphone-arm">Trust Gaming Microphone Arm</a> which clamps to my desk and can easily be positioned, or put out of the way when not in use. It has a built-in USB cable so I don’t have to worry about getting tangled in wires.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.scalefactory.com/blog/2020/07/31/can-you-hear-me-i-can-hear-you/trust_mic_arm.png"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Trust Gaming Microphone Arm</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Mantis and the Q2U both come with a desk mounted tripod stand. The Blue mics all have built-in stands.</p>
<p>Adam picked up an <a href="https://www.ammoon.com/p-i1209.html">Ammoon desktop tripod stand</a>, which is a good price but isn’t height-adjustable, and has a slight tendancy to fall due to the weight distribution when the mic is horizontal.</p>
<h3 id="shock-mount">Shock Mount</h3>
<p>A shock mount is an attachment which connects a microphone to its stand using an elastic “cat’s cradle” mechanism, designed to isolate the mic element from sources of mechanically transmitted noise, such as vibrations …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><picture id="hero-thumbnail">
<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/blog/central-manage.webp" type="image/webp"></picture><p><h2>Published on Jul 31, 2020</h2></p></section><p>Let’s discuss an extremely common anti-pattern I’ve noticed with teams that are relatively new to containers/cloud-native/kubernetes, etc. More so than when building traditional monoliths, cloud-native applications can be incredibly complex and, as a result, need a relatively sophisticated development environment. Unfortunately, this need often isn’t evident at the beginning of the cloud-native journey. Development environments are an afterthought – a cumbersome, heavy, brittle drag on productivity.</p><p>The best teams treat development environments as a priority and devote significant DevOps/SRE time to perfecting them. In doing so, they end up with development environments that “just work” for every developer, not just those who are experienced with containers and Kubernetes. For these teams, every developer has a fast, easy-to-use development environment that works for every developer every time.</p><h2 id="whats-a-development-environment">What’s a development environment?</h2><p>Before we go further, let’s get on the same page about what we mean by a development environment in this context. When working with cloud-native applications, each service depends on numerous containers, serverless functions, and cloud services to operate. For this post, a development environment is a sandbox in which developers can run their code and dependencies for testing. It’s not the IDE, compiler, debugger, or any of those other tools.</p><h2 id="sound-familiar">Sound Familiar?</h2><p>You’re working on a new project or planning to modernize an old one. The team has read all about the whiz-bang nifty new cloud-native technologies, like containers, Kubernetes, etc. So, you decide to take the plunge and build a cloud-native app.</p><p>The team realizes that a core group of DevOps/SREs will be necessary to get everything running in a scalable, reliable, and automated setup. DevOps engineers are hired/trained and get to work. They setup up Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring, logging, and all of the other tools we’ve learned are critical for a modern application.</p><p>Everyone knows that it’s the DevOps/SRE team’s job to get all of this stuff up and running. However, development environments aren’t top of mind. The DevOps team considers it their duty to focus on production and CI/CD – Development is the developer’s job. At the same time, the developers think it’s their job to deliver application features, not to maintain infrastructure. It’s not really anyone’s responsibility to focus on developer experience before CI/CD, so it’s neglected.</p><div><div><h2 id="why-cloud-native-kills-developer-productivityhttpskeldaiowhitepaper"><a href="https://kelda.io/whitepaper/">Why Cloud Native kills developer productivity</a></h2><p>Making the switch to microservices but think it’s too good to be true? Or you already made the switch but you’re starting to notice that local development is harder than it used to be. You’re not alone. <a href="https://kelda.io/whitepaper/">Read more of this whitepaper</a></p></div><picture>
<source data-srcset="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.webp" type="image/webp"><img data-src="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.png" alt="img" src="https://kelda.io/img/Whitepaper.png"></picture></div><p>Unfortunately, an ad hoc approach to development environments tends to emerge. Whenever there’s a new service, whatever developer happens to be working on it, realizes they need some way to boot their dependencies and test their code. They Google around and figure that Docker Compose is a reasonable way to do this. They copy and paste some example, tweak through trial and error until it’s working, and move on. The quality fo this initial compose file ranges widely depending on the DevOps knowledge of the engineer who happened to write it. Sometimes it’s pretty solid; sometimes, it’s brittle and slow.</p><p>Worse, this process repeats. Every time there’s a new service, it gets a new git repository, and some new engineer finds themselves writing a compose file. Perhaps this new file is copied from an existing project. Perhaps it’s developed from scratch. Either way, now we have two compose files that need to be maintained and updated as the app changes over time. This process repeats and repeats until all services have their own ever so slightly different configuration files that are a nightmare to maintain.</p><p>As a result of this (all too common) process. We see several typical issues:</p><ul><li>Development environments are unmanageable. They spread across dozens of repositories in dozens of subtly different copy-and-pasted docker-compose files. Keeping these up to date in a fast-changing application is impossible.</li><li>Development environments are incomplete. They only deal with containers because they are the easiest for an individual developer to get up and running with docker-compose. Everything else developers need to test (serverless functions, databases, specialty cloud services) requires manual effort.</li><li>Developers waste time focusing on things that aren’t their specialization. Just as most backend engineers can’t CSS their way out of a paper bag, there’s no reason for every frontend/AI/data engineer to be experts on the current DevOps trends. Developers shouldn’t spend time configuring and debugging development environments — they should spend time building features.</li></ul><h2 id="managed-development-environments">Managed Development Environments</h2><p>So how do we avoid this all-too-common scenario? The good news is that it’s not particularly challenging to do so if you’re intentional and proactive. The best teams tend to follow a couple of principles to ensure a great experience.</p><p><strong>Clear Responsibility</strong>:</p><p>There’s a team that is explicitly responsible for providing development environments for all developers. That team can be the DevOps/SRE team, or a dedicated developer productivity team. The key is that it’s someone’s job to focus on this issue. Furthermore, that person is likely someone with a large amount of DevOps expertise that will produce better outcomes more efficiently.</p><p><strong>Central Management</strong>:</p><p>The development environment must be managed centrally by the DevOps team responsible for it. A single git repository contains all of the configuration and scripts necessary for a developer to get going. When the DevOps team changes something, they do so once in that central repository, and all developers benefit. Furthermore, typically, the development environments run in a centrally managed cluster in the cloud. As a result, it’s easy for the DevOps team to ensure things work consistently for everyone, and debug problems when they do arise.</p><p><strong>Full Automation</strong>:</p><p>Their development environments are fully automated. A single command brings up everything a developer needs to test their code. Developers don’t need to do nearly any manual setup work beyond the code changes they’re actively working on.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Achieving these goals isn’t easy. It requires a significant and sustained investment from the DevOps team, and buy-in from developers and management to succeed. However, while the cost can be significant, it’s small relative to the wasted time and effort saved by giving every developer a fast environment that just works every time. At <a href="https://kelda.io/">Kelda</a>, we’re working hard to make this dream attainable for every developer.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blimp/docs/sign-up-try-blimp/">Try Blimp</a> to see how you can improve development speed</p><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blog/how-docker-stores-registry-credentials/">Read more about Docker internals</a> – see how registry credentials are stored.</p><p><a href="https://kelda.io/blog/docker-volumes-for-development/">Tutorial: How to Use Docker Volumes to Code Faster</a></p><hr><p>By: Ethan Jackson</p><div><picture>

Fortunately for me, someone had already contacted Tent City. &nbsp;A couple folks were waiting for us, ready to help unload the food.</p><p>As we finished setting up the trays, the dinner call went out. I was expecting a long line of rowdy, hungry people to suddenly appear. Instead, cheerful groups eased by, cracking jokes as they loaded up their plates. “The pie is awful, want me to take it off your hands?” “Thanks for the food guys, you grab a plate too!”</p><p>John, one of the men who’d helped unload, walked over and started telling me about the camp. It was like nothing I’d imagined. They had weekly elections, term limits included; John was the group’s leader this week. Every big decision the camp made was put to a vote, majority rules. They ran their own security patrols around the camp and had zero tolerance for drugs. There were even conflict resolution protocols! It was a democracy the Greeks would be proud of, living under blue tarps in an overcrowded parking lot.</p><p>Even their living arrangements surprised me. They made agreements with various churches to camp out in their parking lot for three months at a time. Careful not to overstay their welcome, when the three months were up they’d pack their bags and move to some other church.</p><p>And then the bombshell: Five days from now their current stay ended and they’d have to leave. But they still didn’t have a place to go.</p><p>It was a punch to the gut. Hearing it directly from John made it viscerally real in a way that no powerpoint on poverty could hope to achieve.</p><p>I wanted to help. And not just give money.</p><p>But...that went against reason. Why not spend that time earning more money and donate it, like I’d always done? If $10/hour labor can do what I would do, isn’t it better to spend that hour earning $40 and donate that instead? Why did this feel different?</p><p>Over the next few years I started noticing the answer surfacing in multiple ancient cultures, based on millennia of hard won wisdom. From the east to the west, across Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and the Orient, the sages offer the same advice:</p><p><strong>Build your community. Support each other.</strong></p><p>Ancient Japanese wisdom talks about <em>ikigai</em>, the happiness of always being busy.</p><p>Busy doing what? <strong>Helping others.</strong></p><p><em>Wait, what? Become happier by helping others? How about I become happier by watching Netflix?</em></p><p>It’s a bit counter intuitive, but that’s how our psychology works. Leisure activities like watching TV offer quick dopamine hits, but helping others is what offers that feeling of fulfillment.</p><p>And the ancients knew this:</p><p>Christianity encourages the service based life, <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/the-importance-of-being-in-service-to-others-for-your-own-success-c1d7f5711b21">preaching</a> that you “need to be a servant to be truly fulfilled.” No, buying the latest iPhone won’t do it. </p><p>Even Islam teaches that the best deed you can do is to <a href="https://www.al-islam.org/kitab-al-mumin-al-husayn-ibn-said-al-kufi-al-ahwazi/chapter-5-reward-helping-believer-relieving-him">help your brother</a>. But it adds a catch: your <em>niyyat </em>— your &nbsp;intention, your mindset — has to be correct.</p><p>When you help others you must actually care about the other person. Prophet Muhammad said “None of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.” It’s not enough to do something for others while hoping they’ll reciprocate. You can’t be hoping they’ll like you. Or expect applause. That’s not the right <em>niyyat, </em>and<em> </em>it won't do you much good.</p><p>Caring is critical.</p><p><em>“Wait, this sounds contradictory. You’re telling me to help others selflessly because then I’ll feel better? Isn’t that inherently selfish?</em>” Well, kind of, yeah.</p><p>It’s not about being perfectly altruistic.</p><p>It’s about the things you think of <strong>while </strong>you’re helping others. The thoughts going through your head in the moment. Have you connected with the other person on a human level? Are you solely focused on <em>their </em>welfare?</p><p>Paradoxically, it is when you’re not thinking of the benefits to yourself that you benefit the most. </p><p>The benefit to yourself is an afterthought, a gift you notice. It can even be something you think of beforehand to motivate yourself into offering that help in the first place.</p><p>But in the moment? It’s gotta be all about the other guy.</p><blockquote><em>“It’s not about me. It’s about others.” --<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-knowledge-project-with-shane-parrish/id990149481?i=1000470071113">John Maxwell</a></em></blockquote><p>Let go of the self centered mindset. Focus on helping others because you think they are worth it. Parents know this instinctively: When I’m feeding my toddler I’m not thinking about her reciprocating one day. That’s not how we work.</p><p><em>“Okay, my kids are one thing. But man, what about everyone else? Do I have to care about them all? That sounds hard.”</em> Yeah, that’s a tall order. And you only have the right <em>niyyat</em> when you help people you care about.</p><p>So...who do you care about?</p><p>It’s hard to care about a statistic.</p><p>I used to be a big believer in <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/#promising-causes">effective altruism</a>. It emphasizes giving charity to places where the largest number of people will benefit from it. There’s definitely value in that philosophy, but that’s not how our psychology works. People are <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jisCHmxwmKoNwrRst/why-don-t-people-help-others-more">more motivated to help</a> if you tell them a story of just one person who would benefit from a $100 donation, compared to hearing about 3 million people who need the help.</p><p>It’s more fulfilling to help those we relate to.</p><p>And while donating money is great, nothing packs a bigger punch than taking the time to personally help people you’ve connected with. The Jewish concept of <em><a href="https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/jewish-philanthropy-concept-tzedakah">tzedakah</a></em> emphasizes that charity "cannot be done to someone – rather, it must be done with someone"</p><p>The Japanese take this a step further and emphasize building your <em>moai</em>. A <em>moai</em> is a group of people with common goals who look out for each other. You become part of a community and your focus is on helping <strong>your own </strong>group. </p><blockquote>You lift up those you care about.</blockquote><p>Islam has a similar emphasis on community: It encourages congregating morning, noon, and night for daily prayers. Imagine the connection you’d build interacting with people that regularly. Simply accepting a dinner invitation and breaking bread with someone is considered more praiseworthy than most acts of personal worship. It’s another way to cement those ties of brotherhood.</p><p>The instructions are clear: know your community, and help your brother.</p><p>Communities come in many forms, but remember, to be a <em>moai</em> it must have two components:</p><ol><li>Individuals have shared goals</li><li>They have each other’s backs.</li></ol><p>The internet makes it easy to find people who share your goals, just go check Twitter. But there isn’t anyone looking out for you. You’re a drop in the ocean, a faceless name in the sea. Maybe you get a question answered, a post ‘liked’, or possibly even reshared if you’re lucky. Then one swipe later you’re forgotten, a quick dopamine hit fading away.</p><p>That deep connection was never there. It’s not a <em>moai</em>.</p><p>Deep relationships come from interacting repeatedly with the same people. By knowing their stories, and them knowing yours. From caring about each other and looking out for each other.</p><p>Those bonds are hard to form in large forums. You need to have 1:1 conversations for that to happen, and even then there’s an upper limit to how many people you can befriend. Studies show people can only have <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/friends-adults-american-how-to-friendship-difficulty-a8906861.html">3-5 closest friends</a>, a couple dozen that you can be somewhat close to, and 150 people casual friends. That hundred and fifty <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191001-dunbars-number-why-we-can-only-maintain-150-relationships">is the upper limit</a> of how large a community can get before people stop feeling connected and the group splits apart. Don't bother joining a group larger than that. &nbsp;If you can’t invest time in people, you can’t hope to be close to them.</p><p>If you do find yourself in a large group, find a smaller subgroup that you can have closer ties with. I’m currently taking a class called Write of Passage, which has over two hundred people enrolled. As we practice writing essays, we'll offer each other feedback on theirs, and chat 1:1 via twitter or Zoom. Over time, I found myself gravitating towards the same set of people for most of my interactions. Everyone really wants to see the other person succeed. We're forming our <em>moai.</em></p><p>Together, we lift each other up way higher than any of us could go flying solo</p><p><strong>Build your community. Support each other.</strong></p><p>Your community can be anything you want it to be, but it won’t be real until you know their stories and they know yours.</p><p>When I drove to Tent City 3, the homeless there were just a stereotype. But hearing their stories and struggles first hand turned them into real individuals who <em>mattered</em>.</p><p>I doubt I made a similar impression on them. I didn’t share much of myself, it felt awkward saying anything that might remind them I had an actual home. A couple days later I was probably nothing more to them than “those guys who brought the food.”</p><p>So sure, I gave them a meal.</p><p>They gave me so much more.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>n their long-running effort to defeat cancer, medical researchers have made a startling discovery: A lot of the time, they have no idea how their anti-cancer drugs work. And, strange as it may sound, that is actually great news for future&nbsp;therapies.</p>
<p>â€œWeâ€™re not saying these drugs arenâ€™t good,â€� explains Ann Lin, a geneticist at Stanford University. They really do kill cancerous cells, often quite well; they just donâ€™t do the job the way that their developers believed, she finds. Her work highlights how much of anticancer drug discovery is still based on trial-and-error searches. Itâ€™s as if your auto mechanic learned to fix your car by kicking the fenders and smacking the hood until it started. That technique might get the job done, but there would be no way to improve it or to figure out what went wrong if it failed the next time. Similarly, oncologists have often been forced to rely on drugs without a clear understanding of their mechanism of action, Lin notes; in essence, they were kicking and smacking the tumors at a molecular level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning what they <em>donâ€™t</em> know about those drugs is a critically important step forward. It is allowing Lin and her colleagues to zero in on the actual, specific molecular mechanisms that really do kill cancerous cells. Now that those mechanisms are being identified, drug developers will be able to carry out targeted searches for other treatments that attack cancer the same way.</p>
<p>Better yet, thatâ€™s still only half of the story. While Lin is identifying molecular mechanisms that could lead to new anticancer drugs, Todd Golub is working the problem from the other end—identifying anticancer drugs that could lead to the discovery of new mechanisms.</p>
<blockquote>Drug developers will be able to carry out targeted searches for new treatments.</blockquote>
<p>Golub, the chief scientific officer and director of the Cancer Program at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, realized that trial-and-error searches could actually be extremely useful if there were a way to make them fast and efficient. Extending the metaphor: If you could rapidly try a million different combinations of hood-smacking and fender-kicking,&nbsp;you would undoubtedly&nbsp;uncover surprising new ways to fix your car. The Golub Lab has&nbsp;developed a technique just like that for cancer treatments:&nbsp;a high-speed drug-screening process called <a href="https://www.theprismlab.org/" target="_blank">PRISM</a> (profiling relative inhibition simultaneously in mixtures), which has already proven spectacularly successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golub sees Linâ€™s targeted studies and his own, broad-based drug searches coming together in an open-source database of cancer-fighting tools called the <a href="https://depmap.org/portal/" target="_blank">Cancer Dependency Map</a>. He and his colleagues describe that map as â€œthe preclinical foundation for cancer precision medicineâ€�—a future in which researchers not only know exactly how their drugs work, but also how to tailor them best to the needs of each individual patient.</p>
<p><span>T</span>hese advances come at a critical time. The National Institutes of Health projects that more&nbsp;than 600,000 people will&nbsp;die of cancer this year in the United States, accounting for nearly one out of every four deaths. Progress in cancer treatment has been slow: â€œNinety-seven percent of cancer drugs are predicted to fail clinical trials, more than in any other field,â€� Lin says. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has diverted short-term research away from cancer, even as the coronavirus poses a heightened risk to patients with compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>When Lin started out, she had no inkling she would be taking on such huge challenges. In 2017, while she was a researcher in the lab of <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/jason-sheltzer/" target="_blank">Jason Sheltzer</a> at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, she&nbsp;was conducting a seemingly routine analysis of the way that cancer cells use an enzyme called MELK. Numerous studies had determined the cancer cells canâ€™t live without that enzyme, so it seemed like a promising point of vulnerability. Several MELK-blocking compounds were already undergoing clinical trials as potential anti-cancer drugs.
</p>
<p>Lin was merely trying to learn a little more about why MELK was so essential. â€œThat's when we got the big surprise,â€� she says.</p>
<p>Using a set of gene-editing molecules known as CRISPR/Cas 9, Lin and her collaborators engineered a batch of cancer cells that couldnâ€™t produce any MELK. Instead of dying, though, the cells carried on just fine. Puzzled, she ran the experiment a second time; again, the cells lived. The team then conducted similar experiments on five other supposed cancer targets, all of which also had at least one associated anti-cancer drug in clinical trials. In each case, the cancer cells didnâ€™t care about the specific genes allegedly being targeted by the drugs. Yet, somehow, those drugs&nbsp;were killing cancer cells anyway.
</p>
<p>CRISPR enabled Lin and her team to examine one of the anti-MELK drugs in detail,&nbsp;and thereby&nbsp;to <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/24179" target="_blank">solve the mystery</a>. They determined that the drug attacks cancer cells through a completely different mechanism than the one its developers thought they were going after: It shuts down an enzyme called cyclin-dependent kinase 11, or&nbsp;CDK11, which regulates cancer growth. Researchers had previously attempted to develop drugs that blocked CDK11, but without success—or so they thought. It turns out they had hit their target without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Armed with this deeper insight, oncologists can begin developing more accurate anti-cancer treatments. Even so, bringing those drugs to market will remain&nbsp;a complicated and time-consuming process. Thatâ€™s where Golub comes in.</p>
<p><span>I</span>nstead of looking for drugs that kill cancer, studying how they work, and finally testing if theyâ€™re safe, Golubâ€™s group started with a pool of medical compounds that had already been cleared for human use. They went prospecting in the Broad Institute's Drug Repurposing Hub, an enormous collection of unused pharmaceuticals that passed safety tests but didnâ€™t perform well in late-stage clinical trials. Most of the drugs were developed for other diseases, but Golub suspected that some of them serendipitously would prove effective against cancer.</p>
<p>To find out, he pitted 4,518 different drugs against 578 cancer cell lines taken from 24 different types of tumors. It sounds like an insane process of trial-and-error, and just a few years ago it would have been. The PRISM technique is what makes it practical: By attaching a genetic â€œbarcodeâ€� to each cell line, the researchers were able to test multiple lines at the same time and to automate the whole, data-intensive process.</p>
<p>In the end, Golub team was amazed to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-019-0018-6" target="_blank">discover</a> that nearly 50 of the discarded drugs had anti-cancer activities. Since they had already passed safety trials, these compounds could now speed through the testing process. Even more exciting, some of the drugs flagged in this experiment seem to attack cancers in ways not seen in the lab before. These novel cancer-fighters are prime candidates for the kind of CRISPR analysis that Lin performs, potentially revealing undiscovered molecular techniques for fighting cancer.</p>
<blockquote>Almost 50 of the discarded drugs had anti-cancer activities.</blockquote>
<p>That merger of trial-and-error discovery and targeted analysis is already beginning at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Sara Althubaiti, a bioinformatics expert at the university, has created artificial-intelligence software that sifts through huge databases describing the genetics of cancer. The AI ferrets out previously undiscovered relationships between DNA mutations and cancer behavior. It has already identified dozens of potential anti-cancer target genes—the kind of information needed to fill in Golubâ€™s Cancer Dependency Map.</p>
<p>Lin is heartened to see her early, seemingly botched experiments contributing to this new assault on cancer. With CRISPR precision and PRISM breadth working together, she says, â€œwe might be able to create a more rigorous preclinical pipeline.â€� No fender-kicking required.

August 1, 2020 | https://leoloso.com/posts/introducing-the-graphql-api-for-wordpress/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://leoloso.com/posts/introducing-the-graphql-api-for-wordpress/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday I launched the project I've put all my efforts into: the <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api">GraphQL API for WordPress</a>, a plugin which enables to retrieve data from a WordPress site using the increasingly popular <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> API.</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/interactive-schema.png" alt="Interactive Schema screen in GraphQL API for WordPress" loading="lazy" width="1680" height="976"><figcaption>Interactive Schema screen in GraphQL API for WordPres</figcaption></figure><p>I've been developing this plugin full time for most of the last 12 months. And, taken together with <a href="https://graphql-by-pop.com/">GraphQL by PoP</a> (the CMS-agnostic GraphQL server in PHP, on which it is based), I've spent several years into this project.</p><p>So it's a great relief and pleasure to be finally able to release it to the world. In this blog post I explain all about it.</p><h2 id="heading-existing-api-solutions-in-wordpress">Existing API solutions in WordPress<a href="#heading-existing-api-solutions-in-wordpress"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Before anything, let's tackle the elephant in the room. You may be thinking: "Wait a second. Aren't there already API solutions for WordPress?"</p><p>Yes, there are. The 2 most popular solutions are WP REST API, which is already part of WordPress core, and <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/">WPGraphQL</a>, a plugin which is also based in GraphQL.</p><div><p><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/wp-rest-logo.png" alt="WP REST API logo" loading="lazy" width="350" height="350"></p><p><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/wpgraphql-logo.png" alt="WPGraphQL logo" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024"></p></div><p>"I thought so! But aren't these APIs already good?"</p><p>Yes, they are indeed good. The WP REST API is kept always up-to-date with the latest requirements from the WordPress project, most notably concerning Gutenberg. And WPGraphQL, even though it hasn't been published to the WordPress directory yet, has become more stable during the past year, gained an increasing community of users, and is approaching its 1.0 version.</p><p>"So then, why do we need yet another solution?"</p><p>Possibly, you do not need another solution. If whichever solution you're already using satisfies all your needs, and doesn't give you any trouble at all, then stay there.</p><p>But if your solution doesn't fully satisfy your needs, because it's not so fast, secure or friendly to use; it takes plenty of time to code or write documentation for it; it has limitations that hinder your application; or any other reason at all... then hear me out.</p><h2 id="heading-what's-so-good-about-this-new-plugin">What's so good about this new plugin<a href="#heading-what's-so-good-about-this-new-plugin"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>These are, I believe, GraphQL API for WordPress's two killer features:</p><h3 id="heading-1.-persisted-queries">1.

Security<a href="#heading-2.-security"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>The GraphQL single endpoint, which can return any piece of data accessible through the schema, could potentially allow malicious actors to retrieve private information. Hence, we must implement security measures to protect the data.</p><p>The GraphQL API for WordPress provides several mechanisms to protect the data:</p><p>👉 We can decide to only expose data through <strong>persisted queries</strong>, and completely disable access through the single endpoint (indeed, it is disabled by default).</p><p>👉 We can create <strong>custom endpoints</strong>, each tailored to different users (such as one or another client).</p><p>👉 We can set permissions to each field in the schema through <strong>Access Control Lists</strong>, defining rules such as: Is the user logged-in or not? Does the user have a certain role or capability? Or any custom rule.</p><p>👉 We can define the API to be either <strong>public or private</strong>:</p><p>In the <strong>public API</strong>, the fields in the schema are exposed, and when the permission is not satisfied, the user gets an error message with a description of why the permission was rejected.</p><p>In the <strong>private API</strong>, the schema is customized to every user, containing only the fields available to him or her, and so when attempting to access a forbidden field, the error message says that the field doesn't exist.</p><h2 id="heading-quick-overview-of-the-features">Quick overview of the features<a href="#heading-quick-overview-of-the-features"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Here is an overview of the features shipped with the first version of the plugin.</p><h3 id="heading-graphiql-and-graphiql-explorer">GraphiQL and GraphiQL Explorer<a href="#heading-graphiql-and-graphiql-explorer"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> is a user-friendly client to create GraphQL queries.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/OneGraph/graphiql-explorer">GraphiQL Explorer</a> is an interactive tool attached to GraphiQL, that allows to create the query by point-and-clicking on fields.</p><p>These 2 tools are embedded in the plugin, making it very easy to create the queries:</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/graphiql-explorer.gif" alt="GraphiQL with Explorer" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="686"><figcaption>GraphiQL with Explorer</figcaption></figure><h3 id="heading-interactive-schema">Interactive schema<a href="#heading-interactive-schema"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager">GraphQL Voyager</a> is a tool that enables to explore the GraphQL schema:</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/interactive-schema.gif" alt="Interactive schema" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="840"><figcaption>Interactive schema</figcaption></figure><h3 id="heading-persisted-queries">Persisted queries<a href="#heading-persisted-queries"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>As already explained.</p><h3 id="heading-custom-endpoints">Custom endpoints<a href="#heading-custom-endpoints"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>A custom endpoint with a specific schema configuration can be created for any target, such as:</p><ul><li>A specific client or group of users</li><li>A specific application, like mobile app or website</li><li>Interacting with some 3rd-party API</li><li>etc</li></ul><p>The custom endpoint is a Custom Post Type, and its slug becomes the endpoint.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a web developer, I know the pains of trying to work around kinks to support all variations of all major browsers to have a unified look, feel, and performance. Even though today the top browsers do a better job at supporting and implementing new web-standards it’s far from a perfect situation. So when I heard <a href="http://my.opera.com/haavard/blog/2013/02/13/webkit">Opera was switching its rendering engine</a> to WebKit, a first major browser to do so <a href="http://www.slashgeek.net/2012/06/08/5-features-opera-browser-did-first/">among many other Opera firsts</a>, I was excited because it means I will have one less browser to test for mundanely simple things that all browser should have by default, and do a good job at it.<span id="more-813"></span></p><p>Why do all browsers have such varied levels of performance in implementing web standards?</p><ul><li>Because they are lazy, think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6#Criticism">IE-6 team</a>.</li><li>Because they don’t agree with web-standards and pick and choose which standard they want to support.</li><li>Because depending on how their rendering engine works, it can be harder or take longer to implement on some browsers.</li><li>Because every browser team has their definition of how a web standard should be implemented. So even if all browsers support a web-standard they might not work the same way.</li></ul><p>If you want a single example on pitfalls of having too many options, <em>web rendering engines</em> would be the perfect candidate.</p><center><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?resize=399%2C388" alt="opera-webkit" width="399" height="388" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?resize=300%2C291&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/opera-webkit.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></center><p>Yes, there are valid reasons to worry about having a single choice for the rendering engine. That it might make web-standards less important. That the power might shift to rendering engine as opposed to web standards. But, WebKit is open source and there already exists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers#WebKit-based">many forks of it</a>. Think of WebKit as a Linux kernel and Browsers, using WebKit, as <a href="http://www.slashgeek.net/2012/12/26/create-your-own-custom-ubuntu-based-linux-distro/">Linux Distributions</a>. You can use the same Kernel/WebKit but your performance and feature will and can wildly vary depending on your implementation. There is a reason why people stick with a certain distribution, even though the underlying infrastructure is the same/similar the result and experience can be wildly different. Centos and Ubuntu may use the same kernel and still provide a wildly different level of user experience.</p><p>I rather deal with several forks of WebKit, than deal with different rendering engines. In the end, only the browser with the best user experience will win the race. As we have seen with Firefox and now with Chrome.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Leading a team is difficult – it’s why people love or hate the job. Where a team member incorporates themselves into the people and culture around them, the team lead drives that assimilation and culture. They must understand that each person has a different personality, and therefore each team culture is different.</p>



<p>If this wasn’t enough of a challenge, team leaders need to handle difficult members of their team. In my opinion, this is the most challenging part of the job. A team member who acts in a way that is destructive to their team them means your team suffers. In the medium to long term, if the team keeps suffering, then you have ultimately failed as the team lead.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there are methods and techniques to manage such people. However, it is not a simple or pleasant task. Effectively managing difficult people comes with knowledge and practice. Expect to make a few mistakes along the way. Keep the goal clear in your mind – to develop a high performing team. If you reflect on it, then you will make better judgements when it comes to difficult scenarios in your team.</p>



<p>Below are some of the scenarios I have come across and how I think they should be dealt with.</p>



<h2>Proud Seniors</h2>



<p>Every team has at least one or more seniors on the team. Let’s call him Rob. Rob’s role is to lead the team in a technical manner and make intelligent and informed decisions for the team while coaching less experienced members. Above all, Rob sets a standard for the team and makes sure the standard is upheld.</p>



<p>As Uncle Ben said, ‘With great power, comes great responsibility’. When a leader within the team abuses their position, or does not know how to deal effectively with others, then it can damage other members of the team.</p>



<p>I have often seen Rob act inappropriately towards his team. Sometimes Rob is loud and outspoken and happy to talk over the more junior members of the team. Rob’s opinions are often the only ones heard, while he snaps or condescends other opinions. This can be a natural response –&nbsp; Rob feels like he has the best opinion because he is most experienced. As a result, any challenge is personal.</p>



<p>In a high performing team, each individual must be comfortable to speak out and voice their opinions without judgement. Even juniors who have little experience often give valuable insight into the simple things that the rest of the team have become accustomed to. You need to work to allow Rob’s experience to come through in decision making, while making sure everyone on the team is comfortable voicing their opinions.</p>



<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>



<p>Remember – your goal is to develop a high performing team. In the above scenario the relationship between Rob and the rest of the team is broken. So the question is, how do we repair and maintain that relationship?</p>



<p>In my experience, having Rob work closely with everyone else on the team is the quickest way to mend the relationships. Rather than assigning tasks to Rob and have him work by himself, assign the task to a more junior member and get Rob to oversee it. In this way, Rob will be forced to work on his communication and develop an understanding with the rest of the team.</p>



<p>Over time relationships grow stronger and the more junior team members voice their opinions more often since they are now more comfortable speaking with Rob. Even if Rob’s attitude does not soften, at the very least everyone will know his personality well enough to be comfortable challenging it.</p>



<h2><strong>Too many egos spoil the broth</strong></h2>



<p>Working on a team with one Rob is challenging. A team with multiple Robs can be nearly impossible to handle at times. I have not worked directly on such a team, but I have experienced it by proxy in my managerial days when I had meetings with individual teams.</p>



<p>The most common place egos clash is in the beginning, when the team is being formed. The four team stages of team formation are commonly known as “Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing”. (ref <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development</a> ). When a team begins to form, people aren’t really sure what position they have in the ‘hierarchy’ of the team. They’re not sure what kind of personalities surround them or each other’s backgrounds.</p>



<p>Once the team have been ‘formed’, in other words, once they recognise who will be on their team going forward, then they enter the ‘storming’ phase. This is the phase where team members challenge each other and voice their opinions. This is also the phase that is most painful for the team lead.</p>



<p>As the team try to familiarise themselves with the other team members, they spark and argue with ideas other team members put forward. This is amplified further in job sectors with a high competition – software for example. Each individual on the team wants to be correct and will stand by their views no matter what.</p>



<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>



<p>Don’t worry! This is a natural part of the team’s journey and it will pass.</p>



<p>Once your team gets to know each other, egos will settle down and your team will enter the ‘norming’ phase where they get comfortable with each other and begin working as a team towards the common goal.</p>



<p>In the meantime, it is an opportunity for you to practice conflict resolution. Ever wonder what it would be like to be a politician? Here’s your chance!</p>



<p>If you find that the team are still not settling in with each other, then it might be time to bring in some team practices in order to make decisions and resolve their arguing. You need to discuss this directly with the team (at a retro is a good time) and brainstorm some ways to achieve decisions.</p>



<p>Some ideas for achieving resolutions is to take a team vote, refer to an external expert (if one exists), lay out the pros and cons of the arguments, or refer to the technical lead within the team.</p>



<h2><strong>Unproductive Members</strong></h2>



<p>In any industry and on any team, there are some people who are highly productive and driven, and others who are the polar opposite. I once discovered someone who, hired as a software developer, had merged about 5 commits in the few years they worked in that company. In total, their code contribution amounted to a maximum of 100 lines of code. Let’s call this person Mike.</p>



<p>The Mikes of the world are lazy, unproductive and always have an excuse why their tasks are not completed. Believe it or not, Mike could be the most dangerous and destructive person on your team. All your other team members look at Mike and see the lack of focus and output coming from him. When a difficult job comes, they wonder why they should be bothered to do a good job if Mike is getting away with doing nothing.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Mike brings down the team moral. He is taking up a space which could be filled by a worthwhile and valuable team member. A brand new junior just out of college is far more valuable than Mike. At least a junior is willing to work their way up the ladder and assimilate into the team. Mike has no such goals.</p>



<h3><strong>Resolution</strong></h3>



<p>How do we deal with someone like Mike? Believe it or not, Mike’s problem may not be his lack of knowledge – it is his lack of accountability. Mike has gotten into the habit of working the minimal amount and discovered that by working poorly and making excuses, he can reduce his work load and take it easy.</p>



<p>So the question is – how to increase Mike’s accountability? It’s quite simple – don’t let Mike work by himself!</p>



<p>Remember how Mike made just 5 commits at his company over a couple of years? What do you think the scrum master did? He continued to assign small tasks to Mike and leave him by himself without anyone working him. Mike had no accountability to his team, so he didn’t hold himself accountable. To this day, Mike is known for doing the smallest amount of work, and nobody wants to work with him.</p>



<p>As team lead, you can fix this surprisingly quickly. Team Mike up with one of the more productive members (Vicky) who can guide Mike and hold him accountable. Vicky can support Mike in working on his tasks in a ‘pair-programming’ manner. This will prevent Mike from skipping off for a few hours or getting distracted easily.</p>



<p>For each of Mike’s tasks, ensure that he is not working by himself – always pair him with someone else. You might think that this is a waste of Vicky’s time. In the short term, this may be true. But in the long term, Mike will develop a discipline and become more productive by himself. He will gradually gain back the trust of the team and hold himself to the same accountability as the rest of the team. Over the long term, the team will benefit greatly from having the extra productive team member.</p>



<p><em>Side note: There is an argument to be made that nobody in the team should work by themselves, but that’s for a different post.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Just..not…interested</strong></h2>



<p>In any team, there are jobs that nobody wants to do. Documentation, bugs, support, admin, testing…the list goes on. As the team lead, it should be one of your focuses to provide each team member with a balanced workload according to their skill set.</p>



<p>Notice how I didn’t say that everyone should have an equal workload – that is a bad tactic for a high performing team. As a quick example, juniors learn quickest by getting involved in some of the boring work (testing, documentation). Whereas seniors are kept interested by removing this work from them as much as possible.</p>



<h3>Resolution</h3>



<p>Each person on the team needs work that is challenging according to their expertise. If one of your team says they are bored of their work, ask them politely what they find boring or tedious. Then work on speeding up the completion of that work and get them onto something they would rather do.</p>



<p>Look back over their previous tasks. Have they been assigned work on numerous occasions that does not challenge them? Can this type of work be shared or shifted to a more junior member? Make a note that their work needs to be more varied in the future.</p>

<h2 id="exercises-and-projects">Exercises and Projects</h2>

<p>I do not have a simple answer to this question either. If you feel comfortable with programming basics and Python syntax, then exercises are a good way to test your knowledge. The resource you used to learn Python will typically have some sort of exercises, so those would be ideal as a first choice. I’d also suggest using the below resources to improve your skills. If you get stuck, reread the material related to those topics, search online, ask for clarifications, etc  — in short, make an effort to solve it. It is okay to skip some troublesome problems (and come back to it later if you have the time), but you should be able to solve most of the beginner problems. Maintaining notes will help too, especially for common mistakes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://exercism.io/tracks/python/exercises">Exercism</a>, <a href="https://www.practicepython.org/">Practicepython</a>, <a href="https://edabit.com/challenges/python3">Edabit</a> — these are all beginner friendly and difficulty levels are marked</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a>, <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Adventofcode</a>, <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Projecteuler</a> — more challenging</li>
  <li><a href="https://py.checkio.org/">Checkio</a>, <a href="https://www.codingame.com/start">Codingame</a>, <a href="https://codecombat.com/play/level/dungeons-of-kithgard">Codecombat</a> — gaming based challenges</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer">/r/dailyprogrammer</a> — not active currently, but there’s plenty of past challenges with discussions</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you are comfortable with basics and syntax, the next step is projects. I use a 10-line program that solves a common problem for me — adding <code>body { text-align: justify }</code> to <code>epub</code> files that are not justify aligned. I didn’t know that this line would help beforehand, I searched online for a solution and then automated the process of unzipping <code>epub</code>, adding the line and then packing it again. That will likely need you to lookup documentation and go through some stackoverflow Q&amp;A as well. And once you have written the solution and use it regularly, you’ll likely encounter corner cases and features to be added. I feel this is a great way to learn and understand programming.</p>

<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>Knowing how to debug your programs is crucial and should be ideally taught right from the beginning instead of a chapter at the end of the book. <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Think Python</a> is an awesome example for such a resource material.</p>

<p>Sites like <a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit">Pythontutor</a> allow you to visually debug a program — you can execute a program step by step and see the current value of variables. Similar feature is typically provided by IDEs like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Pycharm</a> and <a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny</a>. Under the hood, these visualizations are using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html">pdb module</a>. See also <a href="https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/">Python debugging with pdb</a>.</p>

<p>Debugging is often a frustrating experience. Taking a break helps (and sometimes I have found the problem in my dreams). Try to reduce the code as much as possible so that you are left with minimal code necessary to reproduce the issue. Talking about the problem to a friend/colleague/inanimate-objects/etc can help too — known as <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/">Rubber duck debugging</a>. I have often found the issue while formulating a question to be asked on forums like stackoverflow/reddit because writing down your problem is another way to bring clarity than just having a vague idea in your mind. Here’s some more articles on this challenging topic:</p>

<p>Here’s an interesting snippet (modified to keep it small) from a collection of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/169713/whats-the-toughest-bug-you-ever-found-and-fixed">interesting bug stories</a>.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>Another crucial aspect in the programming journey is knowing how to write tests. In bigger projects, usually there are separate engineers (often in much larger number than code developers) to test the code. Even in those cases, writing a few sanity test cases yourself can help you develop faster knowing that the changes aren’t breaking basic functionality.</p>

<p>There’s no single consensus on test methodologies. There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit testing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">Integration testing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-driven development</a> and so on. Often, a combination of these is used. These days, machine learning is also being considered to reduce the testing time, see <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/07/testing-firefox-more-efficiently-with-machine-learning/">Testing Firefox more efficiently with machine learning</a> for example.</p>

<p>When I start a project, I usually try to write the programs incrementally. Say I need to iterate over files from a directory. I will make sure that portion is working (usually with <code>print</code> statements), then add another feature — say file reading and test that and so on. This reduces the burden of testing a large program at once at the end. And depending upon the nature of the program, I’ll add a few sanity tests at the end. For example, for my <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/command_help">command_help</a> project, I copy pasted a few test runs of the program with different options and arguments into a separate file and wrote a program to perform these tests programmatically whenever the source code is modified.</p>

<p>For non-trivial projects, you’ll usually end up needing frameworks like built-in module <code>unittest</code> or third-party modules like <code>pytest</code>. See <a href="https://realpython.com/python-testing/">Getting started with testing in Python</a> and <a href="https://calmcode.io/pytest/introduction.html">calmcode: pytest</a> for discussion on these topics.</p>

<p>“True innovation comes an intersection of a cross-pollination of roles and ideas” - <a href="https://twitter.com/sunils34/">Sunil</a>, <a href="https://erickhun.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f5908dd8b6a1bab5b78093939087">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been working remotely at <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> for 6 years now. As a software engineer, one of the critical skill I believe we <del>should</del> <strong>must</strong> have is being able to learn continuously. However, working in a fully distributed team, <a href="https://timezone.io/team/buffer">split accross 10+ timezones</a>. I live in Asia (UTC +8) while most of my teammates live in the US or Europe. That’s up to 15 hours difference. We only meet each other <a href="https://joel.is/the-power-of-company-retreats/">once a year</a>. This remote setup affects how we learn from my team, compared to if I were in a physical office.</p>
<p>With the current COVID-19 crisis, when company suddenly switched to a work from home setup, understanding how the dynamic of knowledge sharig in your team is important. You don’t want the knowledge shared being stopped. I’ll lay down some of our successful experiments, their pros and cons, what I think works for me and our company.</p>
<h2 id="-the-real-miss-opportunity-in-a-remote-team-knowledge-sharing">❌🧠 The real miss opportunity in a remote team, knowledge sharing</h2>
<p>In a remote team, we don’t have regular random opportunities to come together like we would in a physical office. Conversations will be focused within your current team conversation channel. You won’t be able talk over the watercooler/coffee machine about your current issues with someone else than your core team. You’ll miss opportunities to talk with other teams about their challenges, bring up your expertise, and learn from someone else experiences/advices from an other team. We stop learning as much as we could because we’re not seing each other anymore.</p>
<p>As a remote company, how can you overcome this challenge? How do you optimize knowledge sharing, no matter which timezone?
This is where the concept of regular snackchats at Buffer was born 3 years ago, introduced by <a href="https://twitter.com/sunils34/">Sunil</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-snackchats">🍴💬 Snackchats</h2>
<p>Snackchats are small talks that everyone can propose in the company. It can be any topics, from code, architecture, management, tips for a tool to side projects.  Anything really. We usually ask on slack, and if you  there is enough interest, you commit to it and prepare it.
Here an example of <a href="https://tik.dev/">Tigran</a> asking interest on using Datadog Logs with APM together:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/snackchat-tigran-asks.png" alt="Snackchat Tigran asks interest"></p>
<p>Here a great example of snackchat by <a href="https://hami.sh/">Hamish</a> on an “Intro to GitHub Actions”:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9sdqTc5_qg" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Also here some other great ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/federicoweber">Federico</a> on <a href="https://overflow.buffer.com/2018/06/08/snackchat-may-31-product-oriented-git-workflow/">git workflow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joebirch.co/">Joe</a> on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7OCVQD97WE">Get started with Go</a>”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tips-for-doing-a-snackchat">Tips for doing a snackchat</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep them short: 10 to 20 minutes, keep interest of your audience</li>
<li>Record them, people will be able to see them later if they can’t attend</li>
<li>Your busy teammates will be able to see them at x2 speed</li>
<li>Have a directory (notion/wiki) for future reference</li>
<li>Like video call, putting a face, it’s great to have a human touch to something “technical” to see someones smilling, worrying.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-downsides-of-a-snackchat">The downsides of a Snackchat</h4>
<p>The downside of snackchat is that takes quite a bit of energy to prepare. There can also be intimidating to ask if a topic you might want to present won’t get enough interest from your workmates.
In a remote setting, people will try to make the best use of their time, and we might most of the time be busy on prioritties. The time you will set might not be the best fit for everyone. I wasn’t able to participate to most of the snackchats because I live in a total different timezone than most of the people in the company. The tip here is to <strong>make sure to record your snackchat</strong> and repost it for people who couldn’t attend them.</p>
<h2 id="-impromptu-knowledge-screencasts">⚡️ Impromptu Knowledge Screencasts</h2>
<p>An other format I personally enjoy doing is the “spontaneous” knowlege sharing with a screencast . I’m in the Infrastructure, where product engineers might not necessarly have the need to understand what happens “behind the scene”, but where the knowledge could be useful or pick their curiosity.</p>
<p>I especially enjoy the screencast format for few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snackchats requires preparations, and I know I will not be great at “live” presentations</li>
<li>I’m more in the introvert side.  It require quite a bit of energy to ask interests, worrying if people. Sharing when I feel like it is a way that fits me and I’m satisfied with.</li>
<li>My envy to create educative content isn’t always consistent. There is some days where I will be more encline to share it and some where I’ll not feel like it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tips-on-making-impromptu-knowledge-screencasts">Tips on making “Impromptu Knowledge Screencasts”</h4>
<ul>
<li>I like using <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Loom</a>. They make recording your screen and voice really easy. It also allows you to pause the recording, and aslso has an impressive online editor to trim your blanks.</li>
<li>Try to keep the video dynamic, go to the point, and avoid the fluff, but keep the jokes</li>
<li>Keep it short, ideally under 10 minutes</li>
<li>When I know a video will be valuable on the long term, I try to do some Google slide to structure the video</li>
</ul>
<p>Here an example where I wanted to show (not the first time) the benefits of using one of our internal librarie to make debuguing faster and easier:</p>


<p>1 picture is worth a thousand words, but 1 GIF worth a lot more. It can save you or your teammates a lot of time, save you some context switching, and save your productivity. When someone has a question, or you want to explain something complicated, a simple GIF of the solution will be more than enough than trying to make on a call and explain it.</p>
<p>I enjoy using <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/">cloudapp</a>. For example here what I’ll share when I wanted to share the results after migrating a service from PHP to Golang:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/go-vs-php-cpu.gif" alt="PHP vs Golang CPU usage"></p>
<h2 id="-make-sharing-knowledge-explicitely-valuable">🥇 Make sharing knowledge explicitely valuable</h2>
<p>At Buffer, we have an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_QkZISJ2cIk_Py_pdzsAt5fUwWOYZVkkXg4KZM8IXA/htmlview">engineerig framework</a> that encourage kowledge sharing. To reach a “Senior Engineer 2”, One of the criteria would be… “educates across domain” or “Reach out to other teams within and beyond Buffer to share knowledge”. I don’t mean that money should be the incentive, but , I’ve personally because it was one of the condition to reach the next step, but then started to enjoy it more and more. I’m now doing it because I see value in it now whe other teamate tells me how valuable are my videos.</p>
<p>An other great way to encourange to continue sharing is to reach people who share that their knowledge were helpful. Here for example <a href="https://josemdev.com/">Jose</a> telling me he is using my video for a future mongoDB upgrade:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/jose-watch-eric-loom.jpg" alt="MongDB upgrade Jose watch"></p>
<h2 id="-be-a-teacher-dont-make-asssumptions-over-communicate">👨‍🏫 Be a teacher, don’t make asssumptions, over communicate</h2>
<p>In a remote team, informations get easily lost. Other team members might not have the same context as you, new hires are recurrent occurence, and won’t dare to ask <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_stupid_question">“stupid questions”</a>.</p>
<p>Extra communication is key, don’t make assumption, the more you say, the better teamates will get more knowledge. I’ve even more for trivial questions, where some fundamental might be missing and where your informations will be be really valuable</p>
<p>One of the favorite people I’ve been working at Buffer is certainly <a href="https://twitter.com/colinscape">Colin</a>. Since day 1 I’ve joined the company, he’s been relentlessy explaining and giving context if any issues or questions arises. He’s been certainly the go to person when engineers has doubts or need advices. Indirectly, it help to make you look “approachable” for new members, especially in a remote settings where you won’t have much chance to interract.  Sharing knowledge is definitely a great mark of leadership.</p>
<p>Additioanlly, It will help creating a great culture in your company where there no stupid question exists, and where your team will feel safe.</p>

<p>Sharing links via Slack or email are great, but those content get easily lost. You shouldn’t make assumptions your teammates saw the video or message you’ve shared the other week. I recommend to maintain a directory (in Notion/Paper/Wiki etc…). When you see a question that was answered in one of your video, share it again. A natural snowball effect will happen when your teammates will see more and more people sharing their knowledge.</p>
<p>Keep sharing ❤️</p>

<p><em>No one is watching. No one is listening. No one cares.</em></p>



<p>It’s funny, when you want to <em>send something out</em> to the world, those words are among your greatest fears. </p>



<p>But when you want to <em>keep something from</em> the world, those words can bring you the greatest comfort.</p>



<p>So, what happens when those two desires collide? You get this essay. </p>



<p>For days and even weeks, I have been agonizing and ruminating over whether or not to write this. The full story is so deep, so personal, so raw, that I have never even told my closest friends. It’s a story full of the deepest pain, yet the most amazing beauty. It’s a story so improbable, yet so inspiring. It’s something I’ve avoided discussing my entire life, until now.</p>



<p>If I had to summarize my life, I’d point you to a poem by Tupac, <em>The Rose That Grew From Concrete.&nbsp;</em></p>



<pre><span><em>Did you hear about the rose that grew</em><br><em>from a crack in the concrete?</em><br><em>Proving nature's law is wrong it</em><br><em>learned to walk with out having feet.</em><br><em>Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams,</em><br><em>it learned to breathe fresh air.</em><br><em>Long live the rose that grew from concrete</em><br><em>when no one else ever cared.</em></span></pre>



<p>Life works in strange ways. And it’s even stranger <em>when you are</em> the rose.</p>



<p>Life has a way of taking our assumptions, flipping them upside down, turning them around, and obliterating them right in front of our eyes.</p>



<p>And <em>that</em> is how my story starts.</p>



<h3><strong>Procrastination or Avoidance?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>If you’ve read one of my previous posts on <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/14/hacking-procrastination/">how to avoid procrastination</a>, you might have sensed that I was putting off something that needed to be done. Ironically, in writing that, I was procrastinating.</p>



<p>What you might not have sensed was that I have been avoiding something for a very long time. I have done everything in my power to avoid doing something that I am just now bringing myself, kicking and screaming, to do. Well, writing this essay is that <em>something</em>.</p>



<p>I’ve realized that confining my story within the walls of my mind is a bit selfish. There are millions of people in this world who need to hear my story because there can sometimes be nowhere or no one to turn to for help. Millions of people have dealt with the effects, whether internally or from others, of mental illness. I hope my story can offer a glimmer of support or hope. And furthermore, I realize <em>in order to move fully into the future, I must first set myself free from the past.</em></p>

<h3><strong>Questions</strong></h3>



<p><em>For the first 29 years of my life, I have been running. Running for 29 years can become exhausting, especially if you don’t stop to breathe. But stopping to breathe is, ironically, the best way to keep what’s chasing you from consuming you.</em></p>



<p>I have always shuttered at the idea of small talk. Sure, it might be necessary for connecting with people we wouldn’t otherwise speak with, but I think we would all be better off without it.</p>



<p>I’ve especially disliked being asked small-talk questions like “<em>what do you do for work?</em>” or “<em>what do you plan on doing with your college degree?</em>” I always forced myself to answer in some sort of smart and sophisticated way, but in reality, my story has never folded and unfolded so nicely.</p>



<p>And then, there is the set of questions that I loathed the most. The ones inquiring about my parents. Having faced so many of those questions throughout my life, I have become adept at sidestepping these questions with the dexterity of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=neo+dodging+bullets+matrix&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=XbFwxyF1hD-JPM%252CgLJU_iMBON_OkM%252C_&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kRuHKjeiZBOhl0rJPnE6J6S3jyCHA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj4voPilvrqAhWMlHIEHR9KAdQQ9QEwAXoECAQQHg&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=941#imgrc=TevdsbhIwP7p7M">Neo dodging bullets in the Matrix</a>.</p>



<p>My training ground for these types of questions was in school. When greeted by the question “how’s your mom?” I’d answer with a simple and superficial “good!” It wasn’t very difficult to hide the truth since my mom was fairly active in my life growing up. People knew who she was. They didn’t always know the battle she was fighting.</p>



<p>Occasionally kids would ask questions like “where’s your dad?” I would answer with something along the lines of “he’s busy.” These questions were much more challenging because I only rarely saw my dad. Once a week at best. He never was able to take me to school. Kids never saw him. Teachers never met him. To the outside world, he was, and still is, a mystery.</p>



<p>Each time I faced these questions, I knew I had to come up with some sort of creative way to weasel my way out in order to keep the truth about my upbringing hidden. I wish I could say I would have rather told the truth, but I had always felt a relief by keeping everything hidden. </p>



<p>This is no way for a kid to grow up.</p>



<p>One of the deepest <em>pains</em> in my life has come from the fact that I’ve never had what you would call “normal” parents. The ones who showed you the right way to live. The ones who took you to football practice. The ones who helped pay for college. The ones who cooked you dinner. And the ones who tucked you in at night.</p>



<p>Whatever “normal” parents do, I never had growing up.</p>



<p>But one of the deepest <em>joys</em> of my life has also come from the fact that I’ve never had what you would call “normal” parents.</p>



<h3><strong>My Source of Structure and Stability</strong></h3>



<p>Until I graduated high school, I lived in a rough neighborhood just outside of Philadelphia. As an only-child, raised predominantly by my maternal grandparents, I’ve had no choice but to figure out this world on my own.</p>



<p>My grandfather, a Filipino and Japanese man, of few words and even fewer visible emotions, instilled the discipline that always kept me in line; a discipline that kept me focused on achievement and away from making the wrong decisions. Combine that with eating rice with every meal, and I had an almost stereotypical East Asian upbringing.</p>



<p>My grandmother, who came to this country to escape the turmoil brought on by Fidel Castro in late 1950s Cuba, provided a sense of reliability and steadiness that I would never have had otherwise. She knew the value of personal freedom, and it showed through in how I grew up. She was the yin to my grandfather’s yang. She was there to watch cartoons with me before school, pick me up from the bus stop after school, and wash my clothes every week.</p>



<p>This is the structure I was so lucky to have as a child, considering that I lacked what most people would think of as “normal” parents. The one thing I’ll always be indebted to my grandparents for is that they kept me off the streets. For anyone who has lived in poorer inner city or suburb neighborhoods, you know how incredibly important that is for the development of a young mind. Put simply, if my grandparents hadn’t been there for me early on, I have no idea where I’d be today.</p>



<h3><strong>When Mental Illness Colors Your Outlook On Life</strong></h3>



<p>This is a part of my life that has never been revealed to anyone outside of my family. This is the story that has brought me the most pain over the years. But it is also the story I’m most proud of.  While not the entire story, this, in a nutshell, is what made me who I am today.</p>



<h4><strong><em>My Mom</em></strong></h4>



<p>My mom is a wonderful and loving woman with an extraordinarily creative mind. She has been creating artistic masterpieces through drawing and painting since before she gave birth to me at the age of 17. With as magnetic a personality as you’ll ever imagine, she infuses any room she walks into with an array of vibrant colors that you would find in one of her paintings.</p>



<p>As visible as her talents and personality are to everyone, equally invisible to the world has been her struggle to simply live a stable and consistent life. Since before I was born, she has struggled with the debilitating effects of Bipolar Disorder, a mental health condition that closely resembles a pendulum swinging wildly from one extreme to another. But she never let her condition hinder her from trying to be the best mother she could be.</p>



<p>As a young child who couldn’t possibly understand this, I became accustomed to the unpredictable and, at times, volatile behavior that my mom would occasionally exhibit. As a young mother, she was still coming to terms with how to manage her condition, while simultaneously learning how to raise a child of her own.</p>



<p>There were long stretches of time when she would be home to help raise me. There were also stretches of time when she would be absent from home, for reasons I could never understand. It wasn’t until my teenage years that I began to recognize that my mom wasn’t <em>abandoning</em> me during those times, but she had been seeking help with her condition in the best way any mental health experts could offer.</p>



<p>Through all her struggles, she has fought her hardest to give me the best life possible within her means. Through all of her sacrifices and horrible circumstances, she has shown me that I have always been her “<em>why</em>.” And through her determination to give me the kind of life she fought so hard to live, she proved that with a strong enough “<em>why</em>,” she could endure just about any “<em>how</em>.” <em>Her example has taught me that</em><em>,</em><em> with a meaningful purpose in life, just about any obstacle can be overcome.</em></p>



<h4><strong><em>My Dad</em></strong></h4>



<p>My dad is someone everyone needs in their life. He’s the type of guy who would never hesitate to give his umbrella, his coat, and the shirt off his back to someone in need in the middle of a rainstorm. He is truly a special soul, and someone who I’ll always look up to as an incredible source of inspiration. The tragedy of his story is that he simply never had the chance to live a normal life.</p>



<p>My dad was born in Italy in the 1960s. Much of the world, and Italy in particular, did not have much of an understanding of mental illness at the time. It is no surprise that two traditional Italian parents would never quite understand their only son who would make it past birth. Even when he came to America in the early 1970s, doctors could not offer any advice other than to wait for him to “grow out of it.”</p>



<p>Simply, my dad was born with a set of mental health conditions in an environment hostile to mental health conditions. In poker parlance, my dad was born with a <em>7-2 off suit</em>.</p>



<p>His youth was plagued with delays in speech and walking, …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-cfc2d53ff6eb14603bf1"><div><p>What do <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">NeuraLink</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> have in common? They are both on a quest to synthesize intelligence using a wet lab vs. dry lab approach. Neuralink [wet lab] is trying to interact with the brain and learn straight from the source through implantable brain-machine interfaces. OpenAI [dry lab] is looking to emulate brain functions in the real world. The OpenAI researchers want to democratize access to safe artificial intelligence. Both companies were founded by the real-life version of Tony Stark, the genius inventor and alter ego of the Marvel superhero known as Iron Man. As showcased with his companies SpaceX, Tesla, and Powerwall, the visionary Elon Musk guides us towards a technologically-advanced reality.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI has made the news lately, thanks to their progress in building AI capable of language skills. The&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/" target="_blank">GPT-3</a>&nbsp;language model got released earlier this month with accolades that it can write sequels to the “Lord of the Rings” or even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/gpt3-ai-tool-designs-websites-medicine-a9627966.html" target="_blank">prescribe medicine</a>.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596163915239_4708"><div><p><strong>What do we know about GPT-3?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>High-performance computing and big data are the forcing factors behind recent advances in AI applied to language understanding. We can now simulate the laws of complex universes using vast amounts of data. With the right deep learning models, we can even train AI that learns to mimic human-reasoning pathways embedded in data. This kind of AI that discovers hidden truths has become a mirror for our society as it highlights social biases promoted over generations. After all, robots reflect their creator. If we want to birth safe AI, today is our chance to improve as individuals and collectively.&nbsp;</p><p>The rule of the game in AI language research is to train a more substantial language model on more data. Language models like GTP-3 are trained on VAST amounts of data. GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters and was trained on 40GB of Internet text. GPT-3 is available on a limited release and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/lacker" target="_blank">Kevin Lacker</a>&nbsp;was one of the lucky ones to get access to the giant machinery. Kevin&nbsp;<a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html" target="_blank">shared</a>&nbsp;an excellent analysis of where GPT-3 does a good job vs. where it falls short. GPT-3 often performs like a clever student who hasn’t done their reading trying to bullshit their way through an exam. Some well-known facts, some half-truths, and some straight lies strung together in what first looks like a smooth narrative.&nbsp;You wouldn’t want to rely on this particular student to unearth the next string theory.</p><p><strong>Information ≠ Knowledge</strong></p><p>Memorizing information does not help you solve complex questions on math tests. Like life, math places you in front of new situations that can only be cracked by fitting totally new variables into old-time equations. This game of life and math requires reasoning. A system that only memorizes the laws of the universe will come short when asked to reason. GTP-3 can generate occasionally impressive results from memory, but stumbles when asked to create logical content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some theoretical and practical aspects of why GTP-3 falls short of our expectations.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Reasoning can’t be an afterthought in the design of AI solutions. Systems like GTP-3 will perform poorly in any domain where past experience is sparse - you can’t memorize the unknowns. In the world of Google, it makes little sense to test one’s ability to memorize facts and much more sense to structure and apply knowledge.</p></li><li><p>Giant models have a substantial memory and compute footprint. Not many individuals or companies can afford spinning up production environments that can sustain something like GTP-3. If OpenAI is keen on democratizing access to AI, this approach will surely not enable most stakeholders to engage with, design, or further contribute to AI.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It is a challenge to find representative training data for specialized domains that are not well indexed on the Internet. If we want AI to speak like doctors, the National Library of Medicine will not suffice as a training ground.</p></li><li><p>AI performs best when refined for a problem space. More humble language models like BERT give great results (&gt;90% F1) on knowledge extraction tasks. It is harder for novel language models to improve these results and bridge the gap from 90% -&gt; 100% F1.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By James L. Gibson and Joseph L. Sutherland</strong></p><p>Dictators around the world muzzle debate. Autocratic governments label dissent as treasonous.&nbsp;The voice of the people is rarely heard.</p><p>The hallmark of a liberal democracy, by contrast, is that the people are allowed to assert their views and preferences even if the government, or the majority of their compatriots, don’t like it. They get to protest, to criticize, even to scream or holler or swear—and, on occasion, to listen and change their minds. But this dialogue, which is so central to our system of government, requires two essential ingredients: a willingness to put up with disagreeable views on the part of some and the confidence to express their opinions without fear of retribution on the part of others.</p><p>The most obvious threat to freedom of speech comes from the state: Citizens will only feel safe to criticize their president, for example, if they enjoy protections for their free speech and know that judges won’t do the bidding of the government. But as social scientists and political philosophers have long recognized, social pressures can be just as effective in making citizens afraid of expressing unpopular opinions: The more they fear getting fired from their job or publicly being branded as a “thought criminal,” the more likely they are to self-censor.</p><p>This is why it is so important to measure how free the citizen of democratic countries actually feel to express their views. Is it true, <a href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/">as some have argued</a>, that the current cultural climate has made Americans more reluctant to speak their mind than in the past? Or do we live in a golden age for rollicking debate in which, <a href="https://theobjective.substack.com/p/a-more-specific-letter-on-justice">as others have responded</a>, a far greater number of people feel empowered to join the conversation?</p><p>In the 1950s, many social scientists worried that efforts by Joe McCarthy and his allies to root out left-wingers were creating a “silent generation” of Americans who were afraid to share their political opinions in public. To test whether or not this was really the case, Samuel Stouffer, a Professor of Sociology at Harvard, decided to conduct an innovative public opinion survey. “Do you or don't you feel as free to speak your mind as you used to?” he asked a representative sample of Americans.</p><p>Back in 1954, the answer Stouffer got was surprisingly reassuring. Only about one in eight Americans at that time felt scared to speak their minds. As McCarthy’s influence on the country waned, there was little evidence that he had managed to manufacture a voiceless generation.</p><p>But since the 1950s, answers to that same question have become a lot more worrying. The last time the question was asked, the percentage of Americans who fear speaking their mind had grown by threefold. At its high point in 2015, nearly half of all Americans reported that they do not feel free to express their opinions. </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/be274367-6ba7-4850-b724-7a81580088e8_936x936.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:936,&quot;width&quot;:936,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:286988,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>This trend is worrisome on its face. In comparison to the McCarthy era, it is ghastly. The answer to the question that is now so widely debated seems unambiguous: Americans are much more likely to self-censor today than in the past. </p><p>Perhaps, as some argue, we should not be too worried if some Americans feel the need to self-censor. If those who hold views that are racist or “deplorable” are feeling less free to hold forth than in the past, the country might become a more welcoming place for ethnic, religious, sexual, and other minorities. </p><p>But before we discount the large percentage of Americans who don’t feel free to speak their minds—or, worse, assume that they must feel uncomfortable to do so because they hold deeply despicable views—it is worth finding out who they actually are.</p><p>Three of the clearest findings from our research are negative in nature. First, one might suspect that many people are afraid to speak out because they fear the coercive force of the government. But the data suggest that this is not the case. Among those who believe that the government might prohibit certain political activities, such as organizing protest marches and demonstrations, 40 percent engaged in self-censorship. Among those who believe that it would not, 41 percent did. </p><p>Second, there is no clear partisan pattern. The percentage of Democrats who are worried about speaking their mind is just about identical to the percentage of Republicans who self-censor: 39 and 40 percent, respectively. </p><p>Finally, there is no clear relationship between the intensity of people’s views and their tendency to self-censor. Not only are those with right-wing views as likely to self-censor as those with left-wing views; moderates are just as likely to self-censor as those who fall on either end of the ideological spectrum. </p><p>So what <em>does</em> predict who is reluctant to speak up? The answer is that Americans are more likely to self-censor the more urban and educated they are. In a surprising reversal of the usual trends of political participation, in which citizens who have more resources feel more empowered to take an active role in civic life, it is the urbanites and the highly educated who are most afraid to speak their mind.</p><p>Consider education. Those who are more highly educated are far more likely to censor their views than their less educated brethren. Among Americans without a high school diploma, for example, 27 percent self-censor. Among Americans who completed high school, this goes up to 34 percent. And among those who have attended college for at least a few years, 45 percent do. This suggests that Americans are socialized into learning to keep their mouth shut: the longer you spend in the educational system, the more you learn that it is appropriate to express some views, but not others.</p><p>This helps to explain the nature of contemporary censorship culture. We might imagine that Americans engage in self-censorship if they lack the educational resources to know how they are supposed to talk about certain issues. But the evidence suggests that those Americans who have little education and live in the hinterland actually feel most free to speak their minds. Perhaps they have simply never been taught that it is wise to keep their mouths shut. </p><p>Far from becoming more comfortable with how to express their views as they become more educated, Americans who go to college appear to learn that they should shut up if they disagree with their peers. As a result, it is not those who feel that they have little to say about politics who have learned to hide their “aberrant” views; rather, it is those who live in the most urban and educated parts of the country.</p><p>Decades ago, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann wrote about what she called the “Spiral of Silence.” If they dare to speak up, those holding minority viewpoints get rebuffed. To avoid repeating the same unpleasant experience, they demur when the next opportunity to state their opinions presents itself. Pretty soon, a view held by, say, a quarter of the people in a particular group can, in this way, stop being expressed—or heard—at all.&nbsp;</p><p>The spiral of silence need not be instigated by an oppressive government determined to quash dissent. Rather, it can arise spontaneously when the social norms governing interpersonal interactions provide insufficient support for those who are in the minority—either in the country as a whole, or in some local context—to feel comfortable expressing their views. </p><p>That is why high levels of self-censorship should be treated as an ominous warning sign. They signal the development of a culture of orthodoxy that is animated by a false sense of certainty about what is true and what is false—and a proud intolerance of those who might dare to voice an opinion that conflicts with the mainstream. </p><p>The sobering results of our survey suggest that this accurately describes today’s United States.</p><p><strong>James L.

<h2><a href="#sealed-traits-protect-against-downstream-implementations-c-sealed" id="sealed-traits-protect-against-downstream-implementations-c-sealed">Sealed traits protect against downstream implementations (C-SEALED)</a></h2>
<p>Some traits are only meant to be implemented within the crate that defines them.
In such cases, we can retain the ability to make changes to the trait in a
non-breaking way by using the sealed trait pattern.</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>/// This trait is sealed and cannot be implemented for types outside this crate.
pub trait TheTrait: private::Sealed {
    // Zero or more methods that the user is allowed to call.
    fn ...();

    // Zero or more private methods, not allowed for user to call.
    #[doc(hidden)]
    fn ...();
}

// Implement for some types.
impl TheTrait for usize {
    /* ... */
}

mod private {
    pub trait Sealed {}

    // Implement for those same types, but no others.
    impl Sealed for usize {}
}
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The empty private <code>Sealed</code> supertrait cannot be named by downstream crates, so
we are guaranteed that implementations of <code>Sealed</code> (and therefore <code>TheTrait</code>)
only exist in the current crate. We are free to add methods to <code>TheTrait</code> in a
non-breaking release even though that would ordinarily be a breaking change for
traits that are not sealed. Also we are free to change the signature of methods
that are not publicly documented.</p>
<p>Note that removing a public method or changing the signature of a public method
in a sealed trait are still breaking changes.</p>
<p>To avoid frustrated users trying to implement the trait, it should be documented
in rustdoc that the trait is sealed and not meant to be implemented outside of
the current crate.</p>
<h3><a href="#examples" id="examples">Examples</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/value/trait.Index.html"><code>serde_json::value::Index</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/byteorder/1.1.0/byteorder/trait.ByteOrder.html"><code>byteorder::ByteOrder</code></a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#structs-have-private-fields-c-struct-private" id="structs-have-private-fields-c-struct-private">Structs have private fields (C-STRUCT-PRIVATE)</a></h2>
<p>Making a field public is a strong commitment: it pins down a representation
choice, <em>and</em> prevents the type from providing any validation or maintaining any
invariants on the contents of the field, since clients can mutate it arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Public fields are most appropriate for <code>struct</code> types in the C spirit: compound,
passive data structures. Otherwise, consider providing getter/setter methods and
hiding fields instead.</p>

<h2><a href="#newtypes-encapsulate-implementation-details-c-newtype-hide" id="newtypes-encapsulate-implementation-details-c-newtype-hide">Newtypes encapsulate implementation details (C-NEWTYPE-HIDE)</a></h2>
<p>A newtype can be used to hide representation details while making precise
promises to the client.</p>
<p>For example, consider a function <code>my_transform</code> that returns a compound iterator
type.</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>use std::iter::{Enumerate, Skip};

pub fn my_transform&lt;I: Iterator&gt;(input: I) -&gt; Enumerate&lt;Skip&lt;I&gt;&gt; {
    input.skip(3).enumerate()
}
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We wish to hide this type from the client, so that the client's view of the
return type is roughly <code>Iterator&lt;Item = (usize, T)&gt;</code>. We can do so using the
newtype pattern:</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>use std::iter::{Enumerate, Skip};

pub struct MyTransformResult&lt;I&gt;(Enumerate&lt;Skip&lt;I&gt;&gt;);

impl&lt;I: Iterator&gt; Iterator for MyTransformResult&lt;I&gt; {
    type Item = (usize, I::Item);

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt; {
        self.0.next()
    }
}

pub fn my_transform&lt;I: Iterator&gt;(input: I) -&gt; MyTransformResult&lt;I&gt; {
    MyTransformResult(input.skip(3).enumerate())
}
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Aside from simplifying the signature, this use of newtypes allows us to promise
less to the client. The client does not know <em>how</em> the result iterator is
constructed or represented, which means the representation can change in the
future without breaking client code.</p>
<p>Rust 1.26 also introduces the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1522-conservative-impl-trait.md"><code>impl Trait</code></a> feature, which is more concise
than the newtype pattern but with some additional trade offs, namely with <code>impl Trait</code> you are limited in what you can express.  For example, returning an
iterator that impls <code>Debug</code> or <code>Clone</code> or some combination of the other iterator
extension traits can be problematic.  In summary <code>impl Trait</code> as a return type
is probably great for internal APIs and may even be appropriate for public APIs,
but probably not in all cases.  See the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/edition-guide/rust-2018/trait-system/impl-trait-for-returning-complex-types-with-ease.html">"<code>impl Trait</code> for returning complex
types with ease"</a> section of the Edition Guide for more details.</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>pub fn my_transform&lt;I: Iterator&gt;(input: I) -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = (usize, I::Item)&gt; {
    input.skip(3).enumerate()
}
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>

<h2><a href="#data-structures-do-not-duplicate-derived-trait-bounds-c-struct-bounds" id="data-structures-do-not-duplicate-derived-trait-bounds-c-struct-bounds">Data structures do not duplicate derived trait bounds (C-STRUCT-BOUNDS)</a></h2>
<p>Generic data structures should not use trait bounds that can be derived or do
not otherwise add semantic value. Each trait in the <code>derive</code> attribute will be
expanded into a separate <code>impl</code> block that only applies to generic arguments
that implement that trait.</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>// Prefer this:
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Good&lt;T&gt; { /* ... */ }

// Over this:
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Bad&lt;T: Clone + Debug + PartialEq&gt; { /* ... */ }
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Duplicating derived traits as bounds on <code>Bad</code> is unnecessary and a
backwards-compatibiliity hazard. To illustrate this point, consider deriving
<code>PartialOrd</code> on the structures in the previous example:</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span>// Non-breaking change:
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
struct Good&lt;T&gt; { /* ... */ }

// Breaking change:
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
struct Bad&lt;T: Clone + Debug + PartialEq + PartialOrd&gt; { /* ... */ }
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Generally speaking, adding a trait bound to a data structure is a breaking
change because every consumer of that structure will need to start satisfying
the additional bound. Deriving more traits from the standard library using the
<code>derive</code> attribute is not a breaking change.</p>
<p>The following traits should never be used in bounds on data structures:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Clone</code></li>
<li><code>PartialEq</code></li>
<li><code>PartialOrd</code></li>
<li><code>Debug</code></li>
<li><code>Display</code></li>
<li><code>Default</code></li>
<li><code>Serialize</code></li>
<li><code>Deserialize</code></li>
<li><code>DeserializeOwned</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a grey area around other non-derivable trait bounds that are not
strictly required by the structure definition, like <code>Read</code> or <code>Write</code>. They may
communicate the intended behavior of the type better in its definition but also
limits future extensibility. Including semantically useful trait bounds on data
structures is still less problematic than including derivable traits as bounds.</p>
<h3><a href="#exceptions" id="exceptions">Exceptions</a></h3>
<p>There are three exceptions where trait bounds on structures are required:</p>
<ol>
<li>The data structure refers to an associated type on the trait.</li>
<li>The bound is <code>?Sized</code>.</li>
<li>The data structure has a <code>Drop</code> impl that requires trait bounds.
Rust currently requires all trait bounds on the <code>Drop</code> impl are also present
on the data structure.</li>

<p><em>Word in advance: I have made a few mistakes in the designs you are about to see. Some are intentional, some are not. Always check the datasheet before wiring up something and use some common sense.</em></p>



<p>If you develop prototypes from time to time, you may have designed schematics. A lot of people start with Fritzing, because it’s very easy to start with Fritzing.</p>



<p>My opinion about Fritzing’s earnings model is known thanks to <a href="https://bowero.nl/blog/2019/11/13/how-fritzing-is-killing-itself/">my previous post</a>, but also the technique of Fritzing is not ideal.<a href="https://bowero.nl/blog/2019/11/13/how-fritzing-is-killing-itself/"> </a>This is not so much because Fritzing doesn’t work well, because it does, but because it doesn’t teach you the right techniques.</p>



<h2>Getting started with our prototype in Fritzing</h2>



<p>This is how the default starts in breadboard mode. This allows you to design with visual elements, schematics, as if you were looking at your prototype. That looks like this, for example:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch1-e1573668016835-723x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch1-e1573668016835-723x1024.png 723w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch1-e1573668016835-212x300.png 212w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch1-e1573668016835-768x1088.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch1-e1573668016835.png 808w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px"><figcaption>Image: Our original design in Fritzing on a breadboard</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is still relatively easy to use. It doesn’t look very neat, but it’s easy to build on this drawing. However, the problem is already becoming visible. Imagine if we were to add five more motors to our robot:</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch2-1024x623.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch2-1024x623.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch2-300x182.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch2-768x467.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: Version 2 of our schematics</figcaption></figure>



<p>This way of drawing clearly doesn’t work. The large parts take up far too much space and the connections have to be drawn far too close to each other. As a result, the whole thing becomes very messy and unreadable. The result is that you quickly make mistakes when reproducing these schematics.</p>



<p>This is still a very simple prototype: an Arduino that controls six engines via Bluetooth. There are no sensors, resistors, capacitors, LEDs, buzzers, converters, et cetera.</p>



<h3>Designing schematics based on breadboard design</h3>



<p>Therefore we stop with the “breadboard view” and switch to the second option within Fritzing, namely “schematics”. This of course sounds much more like what we want to make.</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch3-1024x565.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch3-300x165.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch3-768x424.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch3.png 1572w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: Schematics view of our current project</figcaption></figure>



<p>This also looks disastrous. That is logical, as we have not yet started to connect and clean up parts. Fortunately, Fritzing has a tool for us! Before we can use it, we place the parts the way we want them.</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch4-1002x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch4-1002x1024.png 1002w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch4-294x300.png 294w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch4-768x785.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch4.png 1089w" sizes="(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px"><figcaption>Image: Schematics view after replacing the parts</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now we can use Fritzing’s famous tool: autoroute. This tries to automatically make the connections of the components (based on our breadboard design), so that we have a good schematics view. The result is as follows:</p>



<h4>Autorouting our schematics</h4>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch5-1024x957.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch5-1024x957.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch5-300x280.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch5-768x718.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch5.png 1191w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: Useless autorouting</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you can see, only five of the twelve connections are actually connected. The other connections were not made, because Fritzing didn’t succeed in doing so within a hundred attempts.</p>



<p>Originally I thought this was the case because Fritzing doesn’t want to draw lines through other lines, but this scheme is also proof that this is not the case.</p>



<p>I also noticed that in the breadboard view I accidentally connected the GND directly to the VCC. Such a mistake was relatively easy to make in the breadboard view, while in the schematics this would not happen very quickly. Of course I solved this immediately, after which I ran the autoroute again. At that moment everything is done again, and this work of art is created:</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch6-1-1024x962.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch6-1-1024x962.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch6-1-300x282.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch6-1-768x721.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch6-1.png 1287w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: A horrible result of autorouting</figcaption></figure>



<p>Excuse my words, but: What the fuck is going on here? I clicked on the autoroute a thousand more times out of amazement and it never happened again, so I assume this was a bug.</p>



<p>I was actually secretly pleased to see that there were more connections now than before, but every autoroute after this bug gave the same disappointing result:</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch7-1024x957.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch7-1024x957.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch7-300x280.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch7-768x718.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch7.png 1191w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: The result after autorouting again</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately. We haven’t made any progress yet. If we try to solve this neatly by hand, we end up with something like this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch8-1-1024x934.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch8-1-1024x934.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch8-1-300x274.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch8-1-768x701.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch8-1.png 1302w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: The result after routing by hand</figcaption></figure>



<p>After I first had to remove dozens of ratsnest lines, because there was such a line between each VCC and GND, I drew the lines myself. Of course this doesn’t work very well, because a lot of lines have to be drawn over each other and this makes it very difficult to get a clear overview.</p>



<p>It is clear that we need another solution. It doesn’t seem like it’s possible to make everything clear in one drawing. Maybe we should split it up into several drawings.</p>



<h3>PCB design</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, Fritzing doesn’t have the support to do that in a good way. Before I switch to KiCad to show how to do it, I want to show what Fritzing does with PCB’s: the most important part. In the end, you want to be able to convert any good prototype into a PCB.</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch9-1024x653.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch9-1024x653.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch9-300x191.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch9-768x490.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sketch9.png 1044w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: The PCB of our project</figcaption></figure>



<p>After I open the PCB view and manually place everything in a convenient place on my board, I click on autoroute. I expect Fritzing to try to use as few layers as possible and make sure a working PCB comes out.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, only the latter turns out to be true. Fritzing knows how to successfully connect everything, but that’s all there is to it. It doesn’t matter if it doesn’t work, but don’t offer it then.</p>



<h2>A better alternative</h2>



<p>Let’s move on to a solution that will hopefully work better. We’re going to split our design into several parts, each of which will be explained separately. This will keep the whole thing clear to work with.</p>



<p>We’ll get on with <a href="http://www.kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>. This is an open source EDA that actually does work well. (KiCad, if you are reading this: your SSL certificate is not set correctly)</p>



<h3>Create your first schematics</h3>



<p>Let’s start all over again. Let’s learn from what we did wrong with the design in Fritzing. There, we tried to map out the whole system at once, and we saw that it didn’t even work with these small applications. We start by bringing our parts all into our project.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-e1573673522484-1024x580.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-e1573673522484-1024x580.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-e1573673522484-300x170.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-e1573673522484-768x435.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-e1573673522484.png 1551w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: All of our parts in one schematics</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For some reason, this is already looking better, even though we haven’t done anything yet. In my opinion, KiCad feels much more professional than Fritzing.</p>



<p>Please note that I replaced the HC-05 here with a more serious Bluetooth module. The HC-05 is very nice when you are experimenting, but you don’t want to use it in your final product. So, in the prototyping process, start working with the module you want to use, so that you know if it works with your application.</p>



<p>Let’s make some standard connections, and indicate the connections between the elements with labels. KiCad natively supports this and this makes working with these schematics much clearer.</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-1-e1573674561981-1024x580.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-1-e1573674561981-1024x580.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-1-e1573674561981-300x170.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-1-e1573674561981-768x435.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-1-e1573674561981.png 1551w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: All of our parts with connections on one page</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now all our parts are on one page, together with the connections between all the parts. If we now want to expand or clarify parts, it can be done relatively easily. For example, we can add an LED to make it clear when the Bluetooth module is activated and we can make the current in the circuit clear. So I want this to work on a 12V battery and I want to give the motors 6V of that as well.</p>



<figure><img src="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-2-e1573675006130-1024x580.png" alt="" srcset="https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-2-e1573675006130-1024x580.png 1024w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-2-e1573675006130-300x170.png 300w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-2-e1573675006130-768x435.png 768w, https://bowero.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/example-1-2-e1573675006130.png 1551w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Image: Schematics with added information</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is still far from enough to make a good PCB, but it gives a good picture of the difference in readability between Fritzing and KiCad. This is still far from enough to make a good PCB, but it gives a good picture of the difference in readability between Fritzing and KiCad.</p>



<p>On making PCBs in KiCad, I’ll go into it later. I do hope that you have gotten a picture of designing in KiCad and I would strongly advise you to take a look at it. Once you’ve started, you’ll never want to go back to Fritzing.</p>

I came across Derek’s book<strong> </strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2D8GzCL"><strong><em>Anything You Want</em></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>a few years ago when I was reaching burn out amounts of stress from juggling being a full time teacher in a tough school district, running a coaching business and also trying to be a good husband in a new marriage.&nbsp; </p><p>My goal is to pack as much Sivers wisdom into one spot so you won’t have to go crawling through the internet for it.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p><h4>#1 The Pursuit of Enough&nbsp; </h4><p>It is the inability to define what “enough” is that is society’s greatest cause of unhappiness. We walk around with ideas of success <em>thinking</em> that certain things will bring us lasting joy. Usually what we think we want isn’t even <em>our own idea</em>&nbsp;but was rather planted there by someone or something else.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller were at a party at a billionaire’s extravagant estate. Kurt said, “Wow! Look at this place! This guy has everything!” Joseph said, “Yes, but I have something he’ll never have…Enough." </p></blockquote><p>Just think about it: How many times have you seen some ad for a 17 year old kid telling you the single <em>secret</em>&nbsp;to building wealth from his mom’s basement? How many times have you seen some weird guy in front of a rented leer jet on a YouTube pre-roll ad trying to convince you to invest in Bitcoin? How many times have you seen a sports car and sighed wondering when you will get your big break…?&nbsp; </p><p>As Derek’s success grew monetarily in CD Baby his happiness inversely went down. Is that the case for everyone? No. But, it was the case for Derek and that’s an important lesson to understand.&nbsp; </p><p>The single most important lesson I learned from Derek was to ask myself “Am I doing this because I genuinely want to, or am I doing this to impress an invisible jury that exists only in my head?”</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596312178192_16609"><p><h4>#2 No Roads, Only Directions </h4></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596280983756_10748"><div><p>When I was being evacuated by the U.S. State Department from Ukraine in 2014 as Russia invaded, I was told probably one of the single most impactful things by my Ukrainian taxi driver to the airport. </p><p>Ukraine spends more money than any other country in Europe on roadwork but still has some of the worst roads (corruption) so as we tried to avoid the pot hole my driver joked: <em>In Ukraine, there are no roads, only directions</em>.&nbsp; </p><p>This is kinda like business: You might think you have all these wonderful schemes, plans and tricks up your sleeve to scale, make money and create incredible products for your clients only to have them quickly blow up in your face. Instead of scheming Derek suggests you simply “answer the cries for help” instead.&nbsp; </p><h4>#3 Hell Yeah! Or Hell No!&nbsp; </h4><p>Deciding what to do in life should meet one metric: If you aren’t saying “Hell Yeah!” It is an automatic “Hell No!”  </p><p>As a peoplepleaser by nature I’ve ignored this advice only to end up hurting relationships, business deals or customer trust in the long run. It comes down to FOMO. We don’t want to miss out on living a larger life so we collect lukewarm commitments that clog up our day too much to make space for rare “Hell Yeah!” opportunities that may pop up.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>“If you’re not saying “<em>Hell yeah!”</em> About something, say no. When deciding whether to do something if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!” Then say no. When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say “<em>Hell yeah!</em>”&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>It seems that in some cases, you may need to say Yes to things that don’t make you say “Hell Yes” to at least break into a particular sphere or develop relationships. </p><p>The latte boy in the DC lobbyist office doesn’t necessarily want to be everyone’s errand boy, but he knows that a year well spent networking will set him up for what he really wants to do in the long run: deal making. The unpaid graduate assistant coach sleeping on the couch in the locker room of an SEC football program probably has a girlfriend wondering what the heck he is doing, but he knows he is there for the network first.&nbsp; </p><p>Again, the root of this idea is defining enough - defining the limits of what makes you energized and what drains you.&nbsp; </p><h4>#4 Execution, Execution, Execution </h4><p>Steve Jobs wasn’t the first person to try making a smartphone. Uber wasn’t the first ride sharing app idea. Tesla wasn’t the first electric car idea (in fact electric car plans have been around as long as the Model T Ford). It was their execution on these ideas that turned these good ideas into good businesses.&nbsp; </p><p>Good ideas aren’t automatically good businesses.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>…ideas are worth nothing unless they are executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions…To make a business, you need to multiply the two components. </p></blockquote><p>I have been such a reflector in my own life - filling up tombs of journals and notebooks with ideas, theories and notes but it dawned on me looking at all these notebooks: <em>Where was the execution?</em> &nbsp;What if instead of sitting on 1.5hr’s of reading and notes per day I decided to ship, publish and take action instead? I think some reflection is healthy. But I’ve often used idea formation as a crutch to excuse my own inaction. </p><h4>#5 The Market Wants What <em>It</em> &nbsp;Wants </h4><p>It’s important to tinker early and often because you won’t know what people like until you put something in front of them to accept or reject. In <a href="https://brendancahill.io/brensblog/seth">Seth Godin’s marketing work </a>and in my own experience it is abundantly clear that people aren’t always rational. Even if they <em>say</em>&nbsp;they would pay x amount for your product or idea you just won’t know if that’s true until they do.&nbsp; </p><p>So, until your market buys it hasn’t bought. </p><p>Until your course receives sign ups the market doesn’t want it. Until your consulting service is used the market doesn’t want it. This is why it's important to iterate nimbly. Don’t sink all you money into developing a product that people <em>only say</em>&nbsp;is a good idea.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>It’s only a good idea if they buy.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Derek talks about how <em>what he thought</em>&nbsp;CDBaby did was <em>very</em>&nbsp;different from what his paying customers thought it did. He thought “it was just a credit card processing service” but it turned out his clients saw CDBaby as a democratized online CD storefront.&nbsp; </p><p>In my own coaching business I <em>thought</em>&nbsp;was just coaching high school kids how to kick better, but overwhelmingly the parents and players I worked with saw my business as helping them navigate the weird world of college football recruiting.&nbsp; </p><p>What you think your business does isn’t usually what your customers think it does. Why your customers come to you usually isn’t why you think they come to you. Be ready to pivot.&nbsp; </p><h4>#6 The Best Way To Grow Isn’t To Grow.&nbsp; </h4><p>You’ve earned a certain level of trust with your current customers. They love you. They think whatever you’re doing is better than sliced bread. You are giving them oxygen as they gasp for air. You are making them happy. You are helping them live a fuller life. Yet, what do most businesses try to do the second they taste moderate success? Grow.&nbsp; </p><p>Growth isn’t bad, but how it is done is often a problem. They seek to find new clients. Maybe higher paying ones. Maybe ones in different areas. Maybe to break into a <em>new</em>&nbsp;market. But more revenue usually just means more liability, more expenses and less of <em>you</em>&nbsp;to go around to your true fans who love you.&nbsp; </p><p>Of course, this selfish pursuit of growth is justified as selflessness by believing that as a bigger business you can somehow now better meet the needs and wants of your <em>current</em>&nbsp;clients. But really, growth is going to take your focus further away from them.&nbsp; </p><p>If you really want to grow, focus solely on your preexisting clients. </p><blockquote><p>None of your customers will ask you to turn your attention to expanding. They want you to keep your attention focused on them.</p></blockquote><p>The more my own businesses have grown and the more the businesses of my friends have grown the more headaches they’ve experienced.&nbsp; </p><p>Instead of trying to grow your business in volume or quantity grow it qualitatively.&nbsp; </p><p>Your current clients are going to be your best source of newer clients anyway.&nbsp; </p><h4>#7 Exclude! </h4><p>You can’t be all things to everyone. Yet, many business owners do exactly that. When you are trying to gain traction you market to everyone, take every call, take every appointment, and will be overeager to close new sales. The problem is no one wants to be at a club that lets <em>just anyone</em>&nbsp;in - not even you.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you’ve shown how much you value them.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Being exclusive is a long term game you want to play with long term true fan customers. It will feel in the moment like you are saying no to more money, which you technically are, but in the long term you are actually saving yourself more in money and customer happiness.&nbsp; </p><p>Let’s say you let one lousy customer in who you know isn’t a good fit but, since they are willing to pay you a lot you say yes anyway. This customer then calls you day and night, berates your sales staff and sucks the air out of your limited time and attention for the customers you actually <em>do</em>&nbsp;enjoy working with. In fact, you’ve become so distracted that a few of your true fan clients have drifted away to other competitors now. Now this lousy customer has cost you money instead of making you any.&nbsp; </p><p>It’s a fine line between being polarizing enough to rally your 1% troops and appearing crazy or arrogant. It’s only really up to the business owner to know the difference. But, everyone likes to have their own private club. You can give that to them.&nbsp; </p><h4>#8 There’s No Right Way (Which Might Be Wrong)</h4><p>I used to think my heroes playing in the NFL growing up were super men, different, or unique, but through my business I’ve met and made friends with quite a few of them. They’re just like …</p></div></div></div>

		</header>
		  <p>This three instrument âˆ¿ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¹ piano supports play with both keyboard and mouse!
The keyboard setup mirrors the onscreen piano keyboard and allows playing simultaneous notes.
Keys light up red when played and can be held for any length of time.

Thanks to Rodrigo Siqueira for helping prototype this!

Simple Mod Ideas...
- Option to change wave shape with oscillator.type
- Octave and Root Key control
- More instruments try `456` for a major chord</p>

		  <p>Eat apples to grow and shed your skin. Avoid colliding with yourself or skin waste or you'll die. Try to beat the hiscore! Can you reach 25? I can't.

[b]Controls[/b]: WASD or Arrow keys.

Features snake head facing correct direction, decorated snake back, skin shreds as obstacles, randomized apples and cherries, hiscore as unnecessary emojis to reach exactly 1024 bytes ðŸ˜ƒ (no RegPack).

		  <p><strong>Avoid by KChplr</strong><br><span>2d canvas project, 1020/1024 bytes</span></p>
		  
		</header>
		  <p>A roundish game about avoiding things flying your way. Your score increases over time, so does the difficulty. Keep calm and don't go too close to the edge of the playfield.

The focus of this project was to have satisfying controls and a polished gameplay, however simplistic it may be.

[h]Controls[/h]

 - Move using the [b]arrow[/b] keys
 - Accelerate faster with the [b]X[/b] key
 - Restart the game using the [b]R[/b] key once you're hit

You are a merman ðŸ§œðŸ�½â€�â™‚ï¸� with an unlimited supply of harpoons ðŸ”±. Fishes ðŸ¦�ðŸ�¡ðŸ�&nbsp; somehow bounce around the seabed... What would you do? Split them in halves!

This is a version of Pang ([link]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pang_(video_game)[/link]) in 1024 bytes of JavaScript with p5.js. Erik Sombroek ([link]https://twitter.com/eriksombroek[/link]) wrote the original version with an inspiration from [em]Bubble Trouble[/em] and Kang Seonghoon ([link]https://twitter.com/senokay[/link]) minified it to fit the size.

[b]Controls[/b]

The game starts when you start moving around.

â€¢ Left/right arrow to control the merman  
â€¢ Space to shoot a harpoon  
â€¢ Enter to restart the game (even in-game)

[b]Bonuses[/b]

For each hit there is a 10% chance of bonuses. They disappear after 5 bounces, so hurry up!

â€¢ Heart ðŸ’�: You are safe from fishes for one hit.  
â€¢ Clock â�°: Everything except you and your harpoon slows down for 10 seconds.  
â€¢ Star â­�: You can shoot multiple harpoons for 10 seconds.

[b]Technical[/b]

The code was minified with Terser ([link]https://github.com/terser/terser[/link]) and RegPack ([link]https://siorki.github.io/regPack.html[/link]). The actual job is done via a (then) custom version of Terser-online ([link]https://xem.github.io/terser-online/[/link]) with tons of pre- and postprocessing code.

All sprites are done with emoji. Unfortunately different platforms have different emoji fonts, as a result the graphics might be slightly off. It should look well in macOS and reasonably well in Windows, both tested in Chrome and Firefox.</p>

		  <p>Move and attack with arrow keys.
Everything has 8hp.
Your attacks always hit and do d6 damage.
Enemy attacks do 1 damage (except certain enemies, see below), and have hit chance depending on relative levels.
Digging dirt or diamonds also costs 1hp per strike.
Levels are color coded blue=&gt;green=&gt;yellow=&gt;orange=&gt;red.
Defeating an enemy gives you 3xp for enemies below your level, 5xp for enemies of your level,
and 5xp more per each level above.
The victory also gives you 1 hp.
Digging up diamonds gives you 15 xp, but no hp.
You level up when you get 100 xp.
  
The goal is to reach the stairs at the bottom right corner.
  
OBELISK restores your hp to the max when defeated.
WOLF has no special traits.
SKELETON does not restore your hp.
WARRIOR takes 1 less damage from your attacks.
AXE GOBLIN has reduced hit chance but deals 2 damage.
FIRE ELEMENTAL self-destructs on a successful attack, removing 2 of your hp.
WIZARD deals and takes double damage.

		  <p>The idea comes from my new status as a father since the 23th of june of this year!

I always wanted to participate such little competition, but not against others, but against myself. 
This little game is dedicated to my new baby born: Nikki of course :-).

All in pure JS, HTML and CSS with a fluid display.

Please use the arrow keys to "enjoy" the cleaning and have the highest score!

Enjoy :-)</p>

		  <p>The demo is based on verlet integration.

I learned it long ago from this book: [link]https://github.com/Apress/adv-actionscript-3.0-animation[/link]

I have used it in so many projects and languages now that it was time to golf it.

You can see the wrong ideas i had about golfing in this repo: [link]https://github.com/Quinten/detached[/link]</p>

		</header>
		  <p>Rocket simulation near a planet

[b]How to play[/b]
- Set its orbit so that it touches target.
- New target will be set after old target has been reached.
- The game is over when the rocket falls to the planet.

[b]Controls[/b]
- Up arrow: throttle forward
- Down arrow: throttle backward
- Left arrow: turn left
- Right arrow: turn right
- W key: toggle prograde facing

[b]Note[/b]
Same with any physics game, any lag/glitch may cause your rocket to go to the infinity and beyond. :P

[b]Tools[/b]
- RegPack v5.0.3
- Google Closure Compiler</p>

		</header>
		  <p>Series of annulus sectors subdivided using binary and ternary space partioning. Wait a bit for the second motion sequence. At first it goes woosh, then it goes stomp!

There are about one thousands beginPath/arc/stroke calls per frames, it might be taxing for older computers.

        <p>Regardless of the scientific discipline you are working in, you probably
write some code to perform your experiments. This post aims to inform
you about the need for adding a <em>licence</em> to your software—a procedure
that is often neglected, in particular since it is associated with legal
considerations, which are perceived as being tedious by many<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Since
I am not a lawyer, I will go easy on the legalese and just provide
a quick overview.</p>
<p>(If you are in a hurry, feel free to <a href="#parting-thoughts">skip to the conclusion and its actionable items</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector</strong>: your university might require you to consult with
them <em>prior</em> to releasing software into the wild. Make sure to check
whether you are actually allowed to release your code without anyone
checking out the legalities of the situation. This article is mostly
written from a machine learning perspective, where people tend to be
very generous in releasing their code, but often forget to choose an
appropriate licence.</p>

<p>Software licences serve multiple purposes. Most importantly, they specify
what kind of interactions you want people to have with your code. For
example, are you okay with your code—and thus potentially your
name—being used to <em>advertise</em> a product or service of someone else? Are
you okay with people using the software <em>commercially</em>? What happens if
your code does not work as expected and produces <em>incorrect results</em>?</p>
<p>A licence helps you cover all of these aspects—and many more. But the
primary function of a licence is not necessarily to <em>protect</em> you from bad
things, it also defines what kind of community you want to build around your
code. For example, how do you handle improvements of your code? How do
you want to be attributed? How do you want <em>others</em> to be attributed?
Can <em>anyone</em> contribute to your project?</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: A software licence clearly defines what people <em>can</em> and
<em>cannot</em> do with your code. It helps you, your users, and your
potential contributors.</p>

<p>You might think that, being the generous scientist that you are, that
your code should be released with essentially a ‘no strings attached’
policy. That is commendable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, but the law, for once, is <em>not</em> on your
side here: if you release code <em>without</em> a licence attached, the default
interpretation in most—if not all—jurisdictions is that you retain
all privileges. This might sound not too bad, but there are often
unintended  consequences. For example,
<a href="https://choosealicense.com/no-permission">choosealicense.com</a> has the
following things to say about having <em>no</em> licence&nbsp;(emphasis by me):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under
<em>exclusive copyright</em> by default. Unless you include a license that
specifies otherwise, <em>nobody else</em> can copy, distribute, or modify your
work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation.
<strong>Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody”
starts including you</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is bad! Suppose that you revisit a project that you collaborated on
with multiple people. After a few years, you have the urge to make this
into a commercial tool. If you have no licence, you technically have to
negotiate with all of your original contributors, or even your previous
employers&nbsp;(remember that you might change university affiliations a few
times). If you fail to do this, you make your life harder and, in the
worst case, you may be subject to litigation.</p>
<p>However, you are not only impeding <em>your</em> future possibilities if you do
not specify a licence, you are also hurting the options of <em>others</em>:
code without a licence can be removed without a whim, and technically,
everyone who builds on that code has to ask for permission and is not
directly allowed to redistribute it. Again, as a worst-case scenario,
you might have to <em>retract</em> code because you never had the right to use
it in the first place! Plus, companies tend to avoid code without
a licence like a plague because <em>they</em> have legal departments that know
about the dire consequences of using code without the proper legal
framework<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: If you do not use a licence, you are only hurting
yourself&nbsp;(or your future self) and the prospects of your project.</p>

<p>After all these warnings about unintended consequences, it is time for
some good news: in this age, adding a licence to your code is as easy as
it gets. Here are the main steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you have to <em>pick</em> an appropriate licence—no worries, we
will talk about this in a second!</li>
<li>You now create a file called <code>LICENSE</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> in your main code
repository and add your name to it.</li>
<li>Optionally, you now add a text of the form ‘See <code>LICENSE</code> for details
on how to use this code’ to your source code files. This is just
a courtesy for your users; your selected licence still applies to all
source files, but sometimes, adding such a disclaimer is a good
reminder—in particular for large code bases.</li>
<li>You publish the code. That’s it!</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds easy, right? In fact, it is so easy that <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> even provides
licence templates when setting up a repository. It does not even take
a few minutes of your time—which is how it should be!</p>

<p>Now that you know how easy it is, which licence should you choose?  For
this, the website <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choosealicense.com</a> is
a treasure trove. Moreover, the website <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/">tldrlegal.com</a>
is also great in explaining the specifics of a licence in plain English.
Please do not take my word for it and check all the licences I will
subsequently mention!</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector</strong>: At this point, I have to stress that what comes next
is my personal opinion and it is thus heavily biased towards a certain
type of licence.  I will try to back up my claims, though!</p>
<h2 id="avoid-copyleft-licences">Avoid copyleft licences</h2>
<p>As a first piece of advice, I would urge you to <em>avoid</em> so-called
copyleft licences, like the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)">GNU General Public Licence v3</a>.
I know that this is a controversial statement for some, but before you
close this tab in anger, let me explain: a copyleft licence forces your
users to require all derivative works—other projects, updates, and
extensions of your code—to be released under the <em>same</em> licence as
your original code. This sounds fair at first glance—after all, you
made your code available for anyone else to be free to use, so others
should do the same, right? While I agree with this sentiment, the
GPL&nbsp;(and similar licences) make it harder for private companies to
engage with your project. There are subtle legal issues that often
require for-profit businesses <em>not</em> to engage with code like this, even
if they wanted to!</p>
<p>Note that I am not claiming that there are no successful industry
contributions to GPL projects! I am merely pointing out that this
licence raises the bar quite considerably for other institutions to
engage with your code. Especially when you develop tools for others to
be used, as is very common in bioinformatics and machine learning, you
want to make it easy for others to build on your work. Do not take my
word for it, though: if you are
not convinced, read <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-on-licensing-in-bioinformatics.html">this article on licencing software in bioinformatics</a>
by <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/">C. Titus Brown</a>,
as well as <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/i-was-wrong-part-2">this article on the troubles with licencing</a>, written
by <a href="https://pachterlab.github.io/biography.html">Lior Pachter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Avoid copyleft licences if you can&nbsp;(but they are still
a lot better than having no licence at all).</p>
<p><strong>Philosophical sidenote</strong>&nbsp;(you may skip this): it is one of my
core tenets that I do not want to <em>force</em> people into a certain kind of
desirable behaviour—such as sharing their code—but rather I want to
<em>convince</em> them. The formulation of copyleft appears to be too
stringent for my taste: I can easily imagine situations in which abiding
by this licence is problematic for the other party, even if they <em>want</em>
to abide by it! Thus, I am not a big proponent of these licences any
more. When I originally got involved with Linux, BSD, and the open
source movement, I liked the GPL a lot, but as I started using BSD more
and more, my stance changed.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-permissive-licence-instead">Use a permissive licence instead</h2>
<p>So, what licence <em>should</em> you choose for your academic code, then?
I prefer the so-called <em>permissive</em> licences, which are often also
referred to as ‘BSD-style’ licences. Permissive licences have minimal
restrictions as to how your software can be used, but they provide
protection for you <em>and</em> make it possible for others to attribute your
work! Here is my preferred permissive licence, the <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-(revised)">Revised BSD 3-Clause
Licence</a>:</p>

According to market research firm IDC, companies end up <a href="https://www.dummies.com/business/human-resources/workplace/how-inefficiency-negatively-impacts-your-business/">losing 20 to 30 percent in revenue every year due to inefficiencies</a>. And that, of course, is a lot!</p><blockquote>Seemingly small and invisible inefficiencies within your development workflow compound over time, cause a dip in productivity, and ultimately lead to unhappy customers.</blockquote><p>Issues in your workflow may seem small at first, but without special attention, they add up, and become extremely apparent over time.</p><p>Over the past couple of years, we've built a collaborative workflow that brings together members from across functions and ship quality features and make customers happy. This guide will walk you through our development workflow and how we think about it at Zepel.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="what-causes-inefficiencies-in-the-software-development-workflow">What causes inefficiencies in the software development workflow?</h2><p><em>Because how can you improve your workflow if you don’t know what to improve upon in the first place?</em></p><p>Like many teams, we made the mistake of thinking, “<em>Setting a workflow is about moving tasks and user stories from one column to another”</em>. And boy, we couldn’t have been more wrong.</p><blockquote>A software development workflow isn’t about moving cards from one column to another. It’s all the invisible flow of information too!</blockquote><p>Let’s look at the 3 causes for a broken software development workflow:</p><h3 id="1-laser-focussed-on-a-specific-task">1. Laser focussed on a specific task</h3><p>In the last 10 years, far too many project management tools have been pushing the notion that you need to focus on just the things you care about.</p><p>Sure, that’s important. But software development isn’t just about checking off tasks. After all, the best developers are the ones who can focus on the fine implementation details while still having a picture of the broader purposes of the feature as a whole.</p><p>By being laser focussed on just the tasks assigned to themselves, development teams miss the forest for the trees.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/C9QalsL2dWHcIS4pt-wUcs-PabXPLgiEK9a2s44cC04GbF850a7p119smKglGDo6dkVr4yHSg5E-Ru6ZZXoA6f4jPvedEKVOKCrXsCM8H-HfO23x2YukjSRp6Ke5x5mQx4jQbvsH" alt="The multiple challenges and needs of project management"><figcaption>The pyramid of development tracking needs</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-greater-emphasis-on-the-process-than-productivity">2. Greater emphasis on the process than productivity</h3><p>While processes are great, we must understand they’re put in place to help your team stay productive and produce a desirable outcome. A mistake many teams make is overemphasizing teams to follow a process when it isn’t helping.</p><p>A good example of this can be seen when teams implement agile processes by the book in the hope of making their team <em>agile</em>. It’s important to keep in mind that processes need to be built with people in mind. And not with rules.</p><p>What good is a process if it hinders your team from being nimble and moving fast anyway?</p><h3 id="3-building-complex-rigid-workflows-to-get-updates-at-every-step">3. Building complex, rigid workflows to get updates at every step</h3><p>Workflows are simple when a team is small. As teams grow, the first thing that gets introduced is complexity. Developers and designers work in silos, without any awareness of what the other team was working on.</p><p>As each phase of the software development occurs in different tools and key pieces of information is lost when teams handoff. </p><p>To keep the development workflow in motion, you need a seamless hand-over between teams. And this needs to happen while each of them focuses on the task at hand without losing sight of the big picture.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="an-improved-development-workflow">An improved development workflow</h2><p>Contrary to common misunderstanding, software development is a dynamic structure and is rarely static. A considerable effort is needed as new functionalities or constraints are added to the system.</p><p>This means, there are far too many moving parts to consider that simple task and issue tracking tools just don’t fall short.</p><p>The development workflow when building software needs to allow teams to achieve three things:</p><ol><li><strong>Get visibility at a specific task and the broader picture.</strong></li><li><strong>Reduce complexity by not having to set up configurations and stitched processes.</strong></li><li><strong>Reduce tools to streamline the process, so team members don’t have to be clueless about where to look for the most recent information.</strong></li></ol><p>The aim was to connect a deeper, connected workflow that allowed the team to do deep work by collaborating cross-functionally and get all the context they needed.</p><p>Naturally, we use <a href="https://zepel.io/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Zepel</a> to improve our development workflow and here’s how we did it. Let’s dive in and look at it step-by-step.</p><h3 id="eliminate-ambiguity-by-creating-alignment-">Eliminate ambiguity by creating alignment.</h3><p>Delivering quality features at every interaction requires alignment from multiple teams and it shouldn’t be a passive process. At Zepel, everything starts with bringing everyone up to speed on the priorities. That means, sharing with the team on the features we need to be working on in the coming weeks and months.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/sprint-planning-roadmap.png" alt="Get a quick overview of the roadmap and track progress with Kanban view of all features"><figcaption>Get a quick overview of the roadmap and track its progress</figcaption></figure><p>Based on the conversations our product team has with the customers and the business needs, the most important features are moved to the top of the todo column. A duration and an owner are set later on after the feature is spec’d and we have an estimate from the development team.</p><p><strong>This gives every single member a complete picture of what our priorities are, even when things change due to unforeseen circumstances.</strong></p><h3 id="think-big-start-small-">Think big, start small.</h3><p>Once the top priority features are prioritized, the product manager jumps in to drill into the specifics of all the functionalities of the feature by writing detailed user stories, tasks, and enhancements. And how each functionality should behave by writing detailed acceptance criteria as descriptions.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/updated-list-of-user-stories-for-sprint-planning.png" alt="A list of user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements"><figcaption>A list of user stories, bugs, enhancements, tasks, and subtasks</figcaption></figure><p>We group and categorize user stories and tasks under Sections to make it easier to understand for anyone new whom we might collaborate.</p><p><strong>This view makes it easy for the product manager to plan features. And gives them (and anyone who’s collaborated later on) a neat document-like view of what the feature is really about.</strong></p><h3 id="putting-an-end-to-countless-what-s-the-update-">Putting an end to countless “What’s the update?”</h3><p>After the feature is spec’d and all user stories are written, we plan and add prioritized items into the <a href="https://zepel.io/features/sprints/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Sprint</a>. By now, all the planning is complete and we're in the execution mode. At this stage, we assign specific user stories and tasks.</p><p>One thing we’re still learning and trying to understand is if it’s okay to add an item to a sprint after it has begun. There are tons of opinions on this one on the internet and we’re still figuring what works for us in this aspect. :)</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/sprint-planning-template.png" alt="Tracking the development using Sprint"><figcaption>Tracking the progress of a sprint</figcaption></figure><p>Since Zepel has a dedicated Sprint view, our team gets all the updates about that specific Sprint in one place — burndown charts, burnup charts, sprint overview, scrum board, and sprint backlog.</p><p>Before the Sprint begins, the development team makes sure they’ve configured Zepel’s GitHub integration to automate their work based on their <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/5-git-workflows-to-improve-development/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">Git Workflows</a>.

Enable seamless handoff.</h3><p>In software development, collaborating within a dev team isn’t enough. You need to be able to collaborate cross-functionally and hand-over information.

In this case, the team composition is primarily the developers with probably one designer or a QA person in the mix.</p><p>However, if you’re a bigger team and have more members involved in building the feature, having a single board with ten status columns to accommodate every function will not be efficient.</p><p>To combat this, we add a board for each team. Like in any board, we move each user story from one column to another. Unlike other tools, Zepel's <a href="https://zepel.io/kanban-software/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=development-workflow">kanban board software</a> also allows us to move a <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/user-stories/">user story</a> from one board to another when we want to collaborate cross-functionally.</p><p><strong>This allows our designer to move a user story from Design board to Dev board’s Todo column once the designer has the final version of the design ready.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/04/multiple-boards.png" alt="Boards in Zepel"><figcaption>Adding …</figcaption></figure></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>The short answer is yes. Let me explain.</p><p>I’ve been working with developers and designers my entire life. </p><p>I’ve built a couple of products, worked at a young startup, and I’m now at Zepel helping development teams build better software.</p><p>I’ve spoken to 1000+ development teams while at Zepel alone. <strong>And it's evident that the way we build products is broken.</strong></p><p>There’s so much disconnect between how you and I talk about building products and how our teams actually build them.</p><p>For all the talk of scrum and agile and getting feedback quickly, there’s so much that’s broken in how we act on the feedback and build the feature.</p><p>Teams spend so much time and effort getting a deeper understanding of customers’ needs. And yet distil everything down to a simple two-line ticket and a couple of lines of markdown description.</p><p>This is hurting your developers. And it’s hurting your business.</p><blockquote>Nothing is more frustrating than having to understand what an entire feature should or shouldn’t do from a two-line ticket filled with ten bullet points of acceptance criteria.</blockquote><p><em>*Here are five prioritized tickets for the upcoming sprint. We have to ship them on time!*</em></p><p>On the other hand, you have teams who are able to build top quality software. They’re the ones who can concentrate on the fine implementation details without losing focus on the broader purpose of the feature as a whole.</p><p>Everyone wants to get to that level. But instead, teams do the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>Teams think in issues and tickets, instead of the feature as a system.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="development-teams-are-not-ticket-movers-">Development teams are not ticket movers!</h2><p>Today, everything is about moving a ticket from “Todo” to “Done” as quick as possible. And watching <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/reports/burndown/">burndown charts</a>. And customizing the tool to the extent that the developer only views a single ticket.</p><p><em>*“What’s the velocity of our team?” is simply another way of asking how quickly can my team move an issue from “Todo” to “Done”.*</em></p><p>Pieces of that stuff are important for productivity and shipping on time.</p><p>But seriously, how is your team supposed to ship anything of value if you narrow their focus down to the smallest unit of work without any context of why it’s needed or how it connects to the whole feature?!</p><p>Overall, we’ve lost our way. Product development today has become more about checking items off a list as quickly as possible. </p><p><strong>It isn’t enough to write multiple user stories and share a Figma link if you want to ship quality software.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-software-product-teams-really-build-software-together">How software product teams really build software together</h2><p>Development teams build better software together when they have the complete context of what and why something is being built.</p><p>To achieve this, the foundational elements need to change.</p><p>And it starts with getting the right abstractions and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>The names you choose determine the perception and the quality of conversations you have. </strong>It’s why top developers spend time obsessing over names for classes, functions, and variables.</p><p>When you open up a VS Code and see a function called <code>send_signup_email</code>, you have a certain sense of what’s going to be inside and why that’s there.</p><p>The right abstractions can drive the team towards asking the right questions. And this is critical.</p><p><strong>Because when you’re tracking issues and tickets in isolation you have no choice but to measure only outputs.</strong></p><p>And teams today don’t want to measure only the outputs. They want to measure <em>outcomes</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-s-the-right-abstraction">What’s the right abstraction?</h2><p>The right abstraction is the one that prioritizes people over processes and tools. It's the one you and I use every day — it's Features.</p><p>When a squad creates a Feature and opens it, they’ll get to look at the entire feature as a unit. A <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/user-stories/">user story</a> inside it might describe a specific functionality. But the difference is, now each developer and designer know how it connects to the larger scheme of things for the entire feature.</p><blockquote>A feature forces inept managers to stop focussing on output-oriented questions like “how can we work faster”. <p>And shifts the focus on outcome-oriented questions like “why should we prioritize this feature” and “how does this feature tie to the OKR”.</p></blockquote><p>Miscellaneous tasks and incoming bugs can be tracked on a separate “List”, so high-priority bugs don't get missed out. And of course, when it comes to tracking them, they can all be tracked on a Sprint or on a Kanban Board.</p><p><strong>Feature as an abstraction is the right middle ground that lets you focus on the output as well as the outcome.</strong> It lets you zoom in and track what's happening today. It also allows you to zoom out and track a feature's progress across multiple disciplines. And it enables you to see how a feature moves from a feature request all the way to prioritization and development.</p><p>Simple issue trackers and project management tools have shoehorned teams into ticket-movers and have made them think in outputs. Metrics get feigned to show productivity. Thinking in outcomes has become ridiculously hard. And it's hurting businesses.</p><p>It's time for tools to reflect the reality of product development. It's time to remove the disconnect between development teams and what your customers really want. </p><p>It's time to stop thinking in isolated tickets and start thinking in features as a system!</p><hr><p>If you liked what you read, I think you’ll love what we have in store for you.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Oh.. Vim, some people love it, most people hate it. Just the idea of having to modify a simple file in Vim makes some people dizzy. Having to learn all the keyboard commands and not seeing any buttons that you can click with your mouse in a program <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/05/where-vim-came-from.html">from 80’s</a> is already an ugly presentation. I remember the first day at the new company in Spain my coworkers asking me what I’m using to program, and I answered: Vim. You should have seen their reaction to that! I admit the path to using Vim as a default IDE, (yes IDE!) wasn’t so pleasant at the begging, but with some practice, you’ll understand why some people love it. So this is the first post of Vim-series where I’ll show you 5 most essential commands to kick-start your journey in Vim or just to edit some files on the fly.</p>
<h2 id="1-hjkl-moving-around-the-file">1. hjkl: Moving around the file</h2>
<p>This is the first command you will need to move around your file, these four letters are positioned on your home row, under your right hand. And they represent:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">h: Move the cursor left
j: Move the cursor down
k: Move the cursor up
l: Move the cursor right</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="2-gg-and-g-jump-to-start-or-end-of-file">2. gg and G: Jump to start or end of file</h2>
<p>If you find your self in file with hundreds of lines, using ‘j’ or ‘k’ keys to get
to the end of the file would be painful. So we use ‘gg’ and ‘G’ keys to jump up and down the file, so:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">gg: Double pressing g key will move the cursor the start of the file
G: Capital G <span>(</span>Shift + g<span>)</span> will move the cursor to the end of the file</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="3-i-insert-text">3. i: Insert text</h2>
<p>After you move the cursor to the desired position in the file, editing text
is possible after entering the ‘Insert mode’ by pressing the ‘i’ key. After
editing the text press ‘ESC’ and return to ‘Normal mode’.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>1</span>. Press <span>'i'</span> key and start editing
<span>2</span>. Press <span>'ESC'</span> when finished</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="4-w-saving-a-file">4. w: Saving a file</h2>
<p>To save your file changes is simple, it’s a 2-step process:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>1</span>. Enter the command mode by pressing <span>":"</span> <span>(</span>Shif+;<span>)</span>
<span>2</span>. Press the <span>'w'</span> key, which stands <span>for</span> write</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="5-q-quit-vim">5. q: Quit Vim</h2>
<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bojan/image/upload/v1596278701/wwRO3GiXgni7IZ1OevNh5xnUXhzhn4VAURCppmt--LI_n0w48v.webp">
</figure>
<p>Now that last and most famous command you will ever need is quit command. Again
it’s a 2-step process where we will need to enter in command mode:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>1</span>. Enter the command mode by pressing <span>":"</span> <span>(</span>Shif+;<span>)</span>
<span>2</span>. Press the <span>'q'</span> key, which stands <span>for</span> quit and has exited Vim</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="6-bonus">6. Bonus</h2>
<p>I know you like easter-eggs, so here is one for you:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>1</span>. Enter the command mode by pressing <span>":"</span> <span>(</span>Shif+;<span>)</span>
<span>2</span>. Type <span>'smile'</span> and press <span>'Enter'</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning Vim is a life-long process, you always learn something new but you need to know just a few commands to do your daily tasks efficiently. If your are serius about more in-depth learning, I highly recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/3hENouv">Pracitcal Vim</a> book by Drew Neil.</p>

<![CDATA[Ink 3 – Build CLI apps with React]]>

August 1, 2020 | https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vadimdemedes.com/posts/ink-3">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="http://term.ink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ink 3</a> is available today.
Ink lets you build command-line apps using React and have fun while doing so too.</p><p>Ink is a special project to me, because it's been surreal to watch how a tiny experiment grew into a full-featured command-line UI toolkit that's used by <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parcel</a>, <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yarn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://node-tap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tap</a>, <a href="https://www.prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/tree/master/scripts/splash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/kyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#whos-using-ink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many others</a>.
I had no idea it had such a great future when I was just playing with React trying to make it render things to a string and output it in the terminal.</p><p>I'm excited to share all the updates with you, so let's dive right in to see what Ink 3 has to offer.</p><p>While it's not so much of a feature, I think it deserves a top spot.
People loved using React to declaratively build UIs for their command-line apps, but sometimes it ended up hurting their end performance.
For example, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a> noticed their build process slowed down, which is obviously not the tradeoff I want Ink's users to accept.</p><p>Ink 3 got rid of quite a few rendering bugs and in some cases I observed a 2x performance improvement when there's a high frequency of re-renders.
Text rendering and the whole support for Flexbox was rethinked from the ground up and rewritten.
It's also much simpler than it was before, which makes issues easier to debug, reproduce and solve.</p><p>Previous version of Ink had multiple hacky workarounds for various layout issues, so it didn't always render what you would expect.
Ink 3 should be a significant improvement in that area.</p><p>Previously you had to use a separate <code>&lt;Color&gt;</code> component for applying color to text.
This could quickly get noisy:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Color</span><span> </span><span>red</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>bold</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hello World</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Color</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>In Ink 3, all functionality from <code>&lt;Color&gt;</code> component was merged into <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> and simplified.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>bold</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>red</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  Hello World</span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>If your terminal supports extended range of colors, you can even use HEX or RGB colors.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Green</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>#005cc5</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Blue</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>rgb(232, 131, 136)</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Red</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/text-color.jpg" width="300"></p><p>Text can also have a colorful background by setting the <code>backgroundColor</code> property, which accepts the same values as <code>color</code>.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>black</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>backgroundColor</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  Black on Green</span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> component.</a></p><p>Boxes can have stylish borders now!
Fun fact, this feature unexpectedly uncovered a range of layout issues in Ink.

Now it parses user input more reliably and can properly detect when user presses combinations of keys, like Shift + Tab for example.

Think of <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> as a terminal-specific implementation for a <a href="http://www.reactvirtualized.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual list</a> technique, where only necessary items are rendered.
<code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> renders all new items above the rest of your UI permanently, which means you can't update them once they are displayed.
This makes <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> a perfect candidate for tools like Jest, where hundreds of completed tests could need to be logged.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Static</span><span> </span><span>items</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>'Test #1'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #2'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Test #3'</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>test</span><span>,</span><span> index</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>green</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      Completed </span><span>{</span><span>test</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Static</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>In Ink 3, <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> is almost twice as performant as it was before and API has been simplified to match libraries like <a href="https://github.com/clauderic/react-tiny-virtual-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-tiny-virtual-list</a>.</p><p>Here's an example of a UI similar to Jest, where completed tests are rendered using <code>&lt;Static&gt;</code>.</p><video src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/static.mp4" muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="" width="500"></video><p>Learn more about <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#static" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&lt;Static&gt;</code> component</a>.</p><p>Yes, you read that right.
You can use React Devtools to inspect the output of your Ink app.
The magical bit is that you can actually change the props of any component and see your CLI update on the fly without having to restart it.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/devtools.jpg" alt="Integration with React Devtools"><span>Integration with React Devtools</span></p><p>You don't need to make any changes to support it, just set <code>DEV=true</code> environment variable and open Devtools:</p><div><pre>$ DEV=true node examples/counter
$ npx react-devtools
</pre></div><p>When one of your components throws an error, React displays a quite verbose error message to the console and a long stack trace.
Most often that stack trace isn't super useful, because it points to React internals.</p><p>Ink 3 offers a simpler and cleaner solution to this problem by defining a global React <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">error boundary</a> and rendering a beautiful overview of the error.</p><p><img src="https://vadimdemedes.com/ink-3/errors.jpg" alt="Error handler UI"><span>Error handler UI</span></p><p>To improve developer UX further, Ink 3 intercepts calls to <code>console.log</code>, <code>console.error</code> and other methods to ensure logs are displayed correctly above your app's UI and not interfere with each other.
This is necessary, because Ink re-renders your UI all the time, which can overwrite the output from <code>console.log</code>.</p><p>If your app has more than one user input displayed at once, it can become tricky to detect which input has the focus and should receive data.
To make this easier, Ink offers two new React hooks:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocus</code></a> - Receive focus.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink#usefocusmanager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>useFocusManager</code></a> - Manage focus programmatically.</li></ul><p>When component calls <code>useFocus</code> hook, it notifies Ink that there's a new focusable component in the UI.
Each time user presses Tab, Ink is going to pass focus to the next focusable component in the queue.</p><div><pre><p><span>1 </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2 </span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3 </span><span></span></p><p><span>4 </span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>5 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6 </span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'First item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'First item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7 </span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8 </span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9 </span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useFocus</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>isFocused </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is focused'</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Second item is not focused'</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Example</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>22</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>First</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Second</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>26</span><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>In the example above, as user presses Tab, focus will be passed back and forth between <code>First</code> and <code>Second</code> components.</p><p>When your app needs to manage focus manually, without waiting on user input, you can use <code>useFocusManager</code> hook.

      <p><strong><em>**From the archives. This piece was originally published on Worldchanging.com on March 25th, 2008.**</em></strong></p>
<p>I've written before about my belief that in times like these, <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/005052.html" target="new">optimism is a powerful political act</a>. As I put it in <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007901.html" target="new">the book</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<em><em>Optimism is a political act.</em></em><p>Entrenched interests use despair, confusion and apathy to prevent change. They encourage modes of thinking which lead us to believe that problems are insolvable, that nothing we do can matter, that the issue is too complex to present even the opportunity for change. It is a long-standing political art to sow the seeds of mistrust between those you would rule over: as Machiavelli said, tyrants do not care if they are hated, so long as those under them do not love one another. Cynicism is often seen as a rebellious attitude in Western popular culture, but, in reality, cynicism in average people is the attitude exactly most likely to conform to the desires of the powerful â€“ cynicism is obedience.</p>
<p>Optimism, by contrast, especially optimism which is neither foolish nor silent, can be revolutionary. Where no one believes in a better future, despair is a logical choice, and people in despair almost never change anything. Where no one believes a better solution is possible, those benefiting from the continuation of a problem are safe. Where no one believes in the possibility of action, apathy becomes an insurmountable obstacle to reform. But introduce intelligent reasons for believing that action is possible, that better solutions are available, and that a better future can be built, and you unleash the power of people to act out of their highest principles. Shared belief in a better future is the strongest glue there is: it creates the opportunity for us to love one another, and love is an explosive force in politics.</p>
<p>Great movements for social change always begin with statements of great optimism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, though, I've been getting asked a lot how it's possible to remain optimistic when the news is so bad, and progress on problems like climate change or global poverty seems hopeless slow. These questions started me thinking about <em>why</em> the tone of coverage and debate about the big issues we face is so unrelentingly grim.</p>
<p><img src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/alexsteffen/pages/189/attachments/original/1430179768/hope-241086_640.jpg?1430179768" alt="hope-241086_640.jpg" width="400" height="292">Some of that darkness comes, undoubtedly, from legitimate despair: from <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007906.html" target="new">solastalgia</a> about the loss of the natural world or from compassion for the horrible suffering of the millions whom our global economy has left behind. Some of it is the cynicism of disappointed idealists, folks who've seen so much of the underside of human nature that they've abandoned hope. Some is <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//007843.html" target="new">the narrative lure of collapse</a>.</p>
<p>But I've come more and more to think that the particular dynamic we see in today's media and political debates, in both North America and Europe, springs also from politics. That its political nature goes largely unrecognized, even by some of that politics' fiercest partisans, may be merely a matter unexamined assumptions.</p>
<p>Here's what I see that politics being:</p>
<p>1) An explicit statement that we are incapable of actually solving the planet's most pressing problems, and that to consider doing so is "unrealistic."</p>
<p>2) A mostly unstated assumption that the reason embracing bold solutions is unrealistic is because those solutions involve unbearable costs.</p>
<p>3) A rarely voiced belief that "realism" ought best to be defined as "in the interests of those doing well today," and that "unbearable costs" ought best to be defined as "any meaningful change in circumstances whatsoever."</p>
<p>4) A widely practiced stance that, therefore, expressions of concern and extremely modest, almost symbolic, small steps and half measures are the appropriate course of action.</p>
<p>Though often combined with <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004799.html" target="new">the politics of fear</a>, this political stance might better be thought of as "the politics of impossibility." (It's as if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeyore" target="new">Eeyore</a> were running the public debate.)</p>
<p>Consider, instead, the politics of optimism:</p>
<p>1) That realism ought best to be defined as "within our capacity" and "necessary."</p>
<p>2) That we have the capacity to create and deploy solutions to the world's biggest problems, and the magnitude of the consequences of failure (both for ourselves and generations to come) demands that we act immediately.</p>
<p>3) That it is possible to act in such a way that the prospects of most people on the planet are improved. While certain costs will be incurred, the returns on those investments will be quite attractive, not only in ecological stability, international security and human well-being, but in terms of plain old economic prosperity. These solutions will make the future <em>better</em> than the present for the almost everyone, and greatly improve the lots of our children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>4) Therefore, defining our <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007879.html" target="new">win scenarios</a>, <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007026.html" target="new">imagining the kind of future we want to create</a>, describing the solutions that will make building that future possible, and publicly committing ourselves to success are the appropriate course of action.</p>
<p>Nothing about the politics of optimism needs to be naive. We can understand that people are fallible, mostly self-motivated and sometimes even mistaken about what's in their own best interests. We can stress the importance of informed decision-making, demand rigor and note uncertainty. We can recognize the massive differentials in power and wealth in our society and be clear-headed about the difficulty of opposing those whose power and wealth is tied to planetary destruction. We can anticipate setbacks and failures, disappointments and betrayals. We can expect corruption and demand transparency. We can freely admit <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//007407.html" target="new">the profound difficulty of the work yet to be done</a>, even the possibility of total failure.</p>
<p>We can freely acknowledge the tremendous struggle ahead of us, and yet choose to remain decidedly optimistic, and to work from a fundamental belief in the possibilities of the future. When we do that, we liberate ourselves from some of the burden of despair and powerlessness we've all been saddled with at <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006915.html" target="new">the dawn of the 21st Century</a>.</p>
<p>But when we do it in public -- when we stand up and refuse to accept the idea that failure is preordained and action is unrealistic -- we strike right down to the heart of the political conflict we really face: the conflict between <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/006520.html" target="new">our party of the future and their party of the past</a>.</p>
<p>I'm more and more convinced that incrementalism in the absence of committed vision almost always serves the politics of impossibility. Paradoxically, a lot of old school activism does as well. The impossibility lobby is entirely okay with Greenpeace or whoever doing direct action to highlight the latest dire predictions about the ruin of the Earth, because they've mostly moved on from debating reality to defining response. They're okay with people thinking the crisis is downright apocalyptic, so long as those same people don't think there's really anything we can do differently.</p>
<p>That's why our best hope lies in a fighting optimism, an optimism that's willing to confront the impossibility lobby and its messengers and make very clear that a feeble, halting response is not the rational or responsible response, but a corrupt and morally bankrupt response.</p>
<p>Every time we explain how a better future might be built, we redraw the boundaries of the possible. We show that the realm of choice available to us is actually quite large, and even includes paths that might, for instance, harm the interests of rich old guys who own big chunks of <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/006997.html" target="new">coal companies</a> or <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//007008.html" target="new">the petrochemical industry</a> but improve the prospects of pretty much everyone else.</p>
<p>We need to accelerate innovation and magnify vision. We need to school ourselves in the possible, share ideas, imagine outcomes, weigh options. We need to figure out how best to transform the systems we've built. I definitely don't have the answers personally, but Worldchanging aims to be a useful tool for people undertaking that exploration.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, we need something more than better answers. We need millions of people who are willing to teach the teachable, comfort the disheartened and confront the scoundrels. We need to take our politics public and take on the whole culture of cynical defeatism. On some days, I think we need an optimism uprising.</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is really important that anyone who has a dim view of the near future (as I often do) but despises the entrenched short-term power interests that make this dim view that much more realistic (as I always do), realizes that pessimism can play right into the hands of those short-term interests.</p>
<p>However, I think it's also important to acknowledge how optimism can also play straight into their hands. Unthinking optimism ("it'll all work out in the end") is as much an excuse for inaction as unthinking pessimism ("we're all doomed"). The more I look at our culture, the less I can decide whether we're in manic denial of harsh realities or neurotically wallowing in despair. Really, the thread that binds both aspects to myopic vested interests is the "unthinking" bit. An opiated bubble of denial paralyzes as much as a depressed withdrawal from pain magnified by imagination past the point of tolerability. You've obviously got no truck with either; I just think "optimism" as a catch-all banner needs to be qualified more.</p>

<p>Any suggestions for how we might name or describe that eyes-open optimism?</p>

<p>Hi, Alex:</p>
<p>Although there are many Buddhist sects and practices, one commonly held idea among them is that compassion makes it possible to see clearly with an open heart and to be present for and with others no matter the circumstances. Maybe that's a kind of "eyes-open optimism."</p>
<p>The awakening of compassion is said to make people less self-centered and more focused on using their kindness and intelligence to assist others. Is it appropriate to ask how we might awaken compassion in response to the issues you describe?</p>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">Verbose regular expressions, now you have one and a bit problems</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p>Regular expressions (regexes) are famously hard to read or write. There are
some techniques you can use to improve this. Like any other code you write,
your regular expression patterns should</p>

<ul>
  <li>include comments</li>
  <li>break apart large blocks into smaller related sections</li>
  <li>use named variables and identifiers</li>
</ul>

<p>Verbose regular expressions, and named caputure groups make this possible.
With these you can</p>

<ul>
  <li>put explanatory comments anywhere in a pattern</li>
  <li>seperate parts over multiple lines</li>
  <li>refer to matches by name rather than number</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s demonstrate, with a typical regex horror in Python 3.x. This pattern
extracts fields from the logs of a web server</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># e.g. '127.0.0.1 - james [09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000] "GET /report HTTP/1.0" 200 123'
</span><span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span>
    <span>r'([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) \[([0-9]{2}/[a-z]{3}/[0-9]{4}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2} [+-][0-9]{4})\] "([a-z]+) ([^ ]+) HTTP/([0-9.]+)" ([0-9]{3}) ([0-9]+|-)'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>IGNORECASE</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>My mind just bounces right off that … bag of symbols. Running it gives the
desired output</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>'127.0.0.1 - james [09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000] "GET /report HTTP/1.0" 200 123'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>match</span><span>.</span><span>groups</span><span>()</span>
<span>(</span><span>'127.0.0.1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'-'</span><span>,</span> <span>'james'</span><span>,</span> <span>'09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000'</span><span>,</span> <span>'GET'</span><span>,</span> <span>'/report'</span><span>,</span> <span>'1.0'</span><span>,</span> <span>'200'</span><span>,</span> <span>'123'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but it’s unreadable, barely usable, and unmaintainable.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-break-it-up">Step 1: break it up</h2>

<p>Our first improvement is to break the pattern into logical parts, using just
string concatenation</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># e.g. '127.0.0.1 - james [09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000] "GET /report HTTP/1.0" 200 123'
</span><span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span>
    <span>r'([^ ]+) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'([^ ]+) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'([^ ]+) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'\[([0-9]{2}/[a-z]{3}/[0-9]{4}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2} [+-][0-9]{4})\] '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'"([a-z]+) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'([^ ]+) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'HTTP/([0-9.]+)" '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'([0-9]{3}) '</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>r'([0-9]+|-)'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>IGNORECASE</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s better, at least we can see the capture groups, but the extra quoting
adds visual noise.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-verbose-syntax">Step 2: Verbose syntax</h2>

<p>Instead lets write the pattern using verbose syntax.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># e.g. '127.0.0.1 - james [09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000] "GET /report HTTP/1.0" 200 123'
</span><span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>r'''
    ([^ ]+)[ ]
    ([^ ]+)[ ]
    ([^ ]+)[ ]
    \[([0-9]{2}/[a-z]{3}/[0-9]{4}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}[ ][+-][0-9]{4})\][ ]
    "([a-z]+)[ ]
    ([^ ]+)[ ]
    HTTP/([0-9.]+)"[ ]
    ([0-9]{3})[ ]
    ([0-9]+|-)
    '''</span><span>,</span>
    <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>IGNORECASE</span> <span>|</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>VERBOSE</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Adding <code>re.VERBOSE</code> tells Python to ignore most whitespace in the pattern.
As a result we can have our expression broken up over several lines, &amp; indent
those lines. We use <code>'[ ]'</code> instead of just <code>' '</code> for the few spaces we care
about.</p>



<p>With this new freedom we can break apart the expression more, &amp; comment it</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># e.g. '127.0.0.1 - james [09/May/2018:16:00:39 +0000] "GET /report HTTP/1.0" 200 123'
</span><span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>r'''
    ([^ ]+)  # Remote host, e.g. "127.0.0.1"
    [ ]
    ([^ ]+)  # Remote ident, almost invariably "-"
    [ ]
    ([^ ]+)  # Remote user, e.g. -, juan, DOMAIN\aniyah
    [ ]
    \[
        (  # Date &amp; time the request was made
            [0-9]{2}/[a-z]{3}/[0-9]{4}  # Date, e.g. 01/jan/1970
            :
            [0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}  # Time, e.g. 23:59:59
            [ ]
            [+-][0-9]{4}  # Time offset, e.g. +0530
        )
    \]
    [ ]
    "
        ([a-z]+)  # HTTP method, e.g. GET, HEAD, Head
        [ ]
        ([^ ]+)  # Path, e.g. /, /report, /imgs/cat.jpg
        [ ]
        HTTP/([0-9.]+)  # HTTP version, e.g. 1.0, 2
    "
    [ ]
    ([0-9]{3})  # HTTP Response code, e.g. 200, 404, 503
    [ ]
    ([0-9]+|-)  # Size of HTTP response body, e.g. -, 10, 0, 123456

    # Intentionally don't terminate the pattern with a $.
    # This allows it to accept lines with extra fields.
    # For now, they're just ignored.
    '''</span><span>,</span>
    <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>IGNORECASE</span> <span>|</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>VERBOSE</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s already much better than what we started with.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-name-the-capture-groups">Step 4: Name the capture groups</h2>

<p>we can go one better by naming the capture groups</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NCSA_COMMON_LOG_PATTERN</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>r'''

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div uk-lightbox="toggle:.lightbox-toggle">
<p>We recently released the <a href="https://pace.dev/docs" rel="nofollow">Pace API</a>, along with an accompanying <a href="https://pace.dev/docs/cli" rel="nofollow">command line tool</a>, and various client libraries, all of which enable programmatic integration with Pace.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto" rel="nofollow">Oto</a> to describe our RPC (Remote Procedure Call) API using Go interfaces and structs, and a variety of templates to generate the code we need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All methods in the API use a input and output struct for the request and response, supporting all JSON data types; strings, numbers, bools, objects and arrays.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="describing-the-api-1">Describing the API</h3>
<p>We describe our API using Go interfaces and structs.</p>
<p>Here’s a sample from our <code>CardsService</code> that describes the <code>GetCard</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>package pace

// CardsService allows you to programmatically manage cards in Pace.
type CardsService interface {
	// GetCard gets a card by ID.
	GetCard(GetCardRequest) GetCardResponse
}

// GetCardRequest is the input object for GetCard.
type GetCardRequest struct {
	// OrgID is the ID of the org.
	// example: "your-org-id"
	OrgID string
	// CardID is the ID of the card to get.
	// example: "123"
	CardID string
}

// GetCardResponse is the output object for GetCard.
type GetCardResponse struct {
	// Card is the card.
	Card Card
}

type Card struct {
	ID           string
	CTime        string
	Title        string
	Body         string
	BodyHTML     string
	// simplified to save your eyes
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since this is real Go code, our IDEs build and lint this along with the rest of our code.</p>
<h3 id="how-oto-parses-the-definition-2">How Oto parses the definition</h3>
<p>Oto uses the <code>golang.org/x/tools/go/packages</code> package (among others from the standard library) to understand the Go code, and turn the definition files into a workable data structure.</p>
<p>The following types are taken from the <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/parser.go" rel="nofollow">parser inside Oto</a>:</p>
<pre><code>// Service describes a service, akin to an interface in Go.
type Service struct {
	Name    string   `json:"name"`
	Methods []Method `json:"methods"`
	Comment string   `json:"comment"`
}

// Method describes a method that a Service can perform.
type Method struct {
	Name           string    `json:"name"`
	NameLowerCamel string    `json:"nameLowerCamel"`
	InputObject    FieldType `json:"inputObject"`
	OutputObject   FieldType `json:"outputObject"`
	Comment        string    `json:"comment"`
}

// etc
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have Go data that describes the interfaces, methods and structs, we can use templates to generate code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oto uses <a href="https://github.com/gobuffalo/plush" rel="nofollow">Plush templates from the Buffalo project</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-generation-3">Code generation</h3>
<p>Oto is essentially a code generation tool, because most of the work needed to wire up an implementation to an endpoint is predictable boilerplate that we would prefer not to write.</p>
<p>When generics lands in Go, we will be able to reduce the amount of boilerplate code generated in favour of generic methods. In this world, we may not need to generate much plumbing code at all.</p>
<h4 id="generating-server-side-plumbing-4">Generating server-side plumbing</h4>
<p>The first thing we generate is the server-side plumbing for the implementation of the service.</p>
<ul>
<li>The template that was used to generate this code is <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/otohttp/templates/server.go.plush" rel="nofollow">available as part of <code>otohttp</code></a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>package api

// CardsService allows you to programmatically manage cards in Pace.
type CardsService interface {
	// GetCard gets a card by ID.
	GetCard(context.Context, GetCardRequest) (*GetCardResponse, error)
}

type cardsServiceServer struct {
	server       *otohttp.Server
	cardsService CardsService
}

// RegisterCardsService registers the CardsService implementation with the otohttp Server.
func RegisterCardsService(server *otohttp.Server, cardsService CardsService) {
	handler := &amp;cardsServiceServer{
		server:       server,
		cardsService: cardsService,
	}
	server.Register("CardsService", "GetCard", handler.handleCardsServiceGetCard)
}

func (s *cardsServiceServer) handleCardsServiceGetCard(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var request GetCardRequest
	if err := otohttp.Decode(r, &amp;request); err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
	response, err := s.cardsService.GetCard(r.Context(), request)
	if err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
	if err := otohttp.Encode(w, r, http.StatusOK, response); err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, we generate:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <code>CardsService</code> Go interface that describes the methods of the service. Notice that <code>context.Context</code> and <code>error</code> types were added to the signature of the methods</li>
<li>The <code>cardsServiceServer</code> struct couples the <code>otohttp.Server</code> with the service implementation, and has real <code>http.Handler</code> methods like <code>handleCardsServiceGetCard</code> that handles the RPC calls</li>
<li>The <code>RegisterCardsService</code> method uses the <code>Register</code> method on the <code>otohttp.Server</code> to bind the route <code>CardsService.GetCard</code> to the appropriate handler</li>
</ul>
<p>All we have to do is write a struct that implements the new <code>CardsService</code> interface, and the generated code, along with the code inside <code>otohttp</code>, does the rest for us.</p>
<h4 id="generating-clients-5">Generating clients</h4>
<p>A client is used to access the services on the remote server.</p>
<p>They aren’t always necessary if you’re working with plain-old JSON/HTTP but due to the security measures in Pace, we need to securely sign each request with a secret cryptographic key so we can be sure it is being made by a trusted partner. This can be tricky, so we generate clients that do it for you.</p>
<p>The first client we generate is a Go package, which we use in our tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By <strong>dog-fooding</strong> the generated Go client in our tests, we can not only ensure the services are functioning as we expect them to, but also that the client itself works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The generated code for the <code>GetCard</code> client (generated from a <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/pace/blob/master/oto/client.go.plush" rel="nofollow">template file in the <code>github.com/pacedotdev/pace</code> project</a>) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>// GetCard gets a card.
func (s *CardsService) GetCard(ctx context.Context, r GetCardRequest) (*GetCardResponse, error) {
	requestBodyBytes, err := json.Marshal(r)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: marshal GetCardRequest")
	}
	signature, err := generateSignature(requestBodyBytes, s.client.secret)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: generate signature GetCardRequest")

<div id="content">

<p>July 2020</p>

<p>There are many ways to do HTTP path routing in Go – for better or worse. There’s the standard library’s <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux"><code>http.ServeMux</code></a>, but it only supports basic prefix matching. There are many ways to do more advanced routing yourself, including Axel Wagner’s interesting <a href="https://blog.merovius.de/2017/06/18/how-not-to-use-an-http-router.html"><code>ShiftPath</code> technique</a>. And then of course there are lots of third-party router libraries. In this article I’m going to do a comparison of several custom techniques and some off-the-shelf packages.</p>

<p>I’ll be upfront about my biases: I like simple and clear code, and I’m a bit allergic to large dependencies (and sometimes those are in tension). Most libraries with “framework” in the title don’t do it for me, though I’m not opposed to using well-maintained libraries that do one or two things well.</p>

<p>My goal here is to route the same 11 URLs with eight different approaches. These URLs are based on a subset of URLs in a web application I maintain. They use <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>, but they’re not particularly RESTful or well designed – the kind of messiness you find in real-world systems. Here are the methods and URLs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GET  /                                      # home
GET  /contact                               # contact
GET  /api/widgets                           # apiGetWidgets
POST /api/widgets                           # apiCreateWidget
POST /api/widgets/:slug                     # apiUpdateWidget
POST /api/widgets/:slug/parts               # apiCreateWidgetPart
POST /api/widgets/:slug/parts/:id/update    # apiUpdateWidgetPart
POST /api/widgets/:slug/parts/:id/delete    # apiDeleteWidgetPart
GET  /:slug                                 # widget
GET  /:slug/admin                           # widgetAdmin
POST /:slug/image                           # widgetImage
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>:slug</code> is a URL-friendly widget identifier like <code>foo-bar</code>, and the <code>:id</code> is a positive integer like <code>1234</code>. Each routing approach should match on the exact URL – trailing slashes will return 404 Not Found (redirecting them is also a fine decision, but I’m not doing that here). Each router should handle the specified method (<code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>) and reject the others with a 405 Method Not Allowed response. I wrote some <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing/blob/master/main_test.go">table-driven tests</a> to ensure that all the routers do the right thing.</p>

<p>In the rest of this article I’ll present code for the various approaches and discuss some pros and cons of each (all the code is in the <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-routing">benhoyt/go-routing</a> repo). There’s a lot of code, but all of it is fairly straight-forward and should be easy to skim. You can use the following links to skip down to a particular technique. First, the five custom techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#regex-table">Regex table</a>: loop through pre-compiled regexes and pass matches using the request context</li>
  <li><a href="#regex-switch">Regex switch</a>: a switch statement with cases that call a regex-based <code>match()</code> helper which scans path parameters into variables</li>
  <li><a href="#pattern-matcher">Pattern matcher</a>: similar to the above, but using a simple pattern matching function instead of regexes</li>
  <li><a href="#split-switch">Split switch</a>: split the path on <code>/</code> and then switch on the contents of the path segments</li>
  <li><a href="#shiftpath">ShiftPath</a>: Axel Wagner’s hierarchical <code>ShiftPath</code> technique</li>
</ul>

<p>And three versions using third-party router packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#chi">Chi</a>: uses <code>github.com/go-chi/chi</code></li>
  <li><a href="#gorilla">Gorilla</a>: uses <code>github.com/gorilla/mux</code></li>
  <li><a href="#pat">Pat</a>: uses <code>github.com/bmizerany/pat</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I also tried <a href="https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter">httprouter</a>, which is supposed to be really fast, but it <a href="https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter/issues/73">can’t handle</a> URLs with overlapping prefixes like <code>/contact</code> and <code>/:slug</code>. Arguably this is bad URL design anyway, but a lot of real-world web apps do it, so I think this is quite limiting.</p>

<p>There are many other third-party router packages or “web frameworks”, but these three bubbled to the top in my searches (and I believe they’re fairly representative).</p>

<p>In this comparison I’m not concerned about speed. Most of the approaches loop or <code>switch</code> through a list of routes (in contrast to fancy trie-lookup structures). All of these approaches only add a few <em>microseconds</em> to the request time (see <a href="#benchmarks">benchmarks</a>), and that isn’t an issue in any of the web applications I’ve worked on.</p>

<h2 id="regex-table">Regex table</h2>

<p>The first approach I want to look at is the method I use in the current version of my web application – it’s the first thing that came to mind when I was learning Go a few years back, and I still think it’s a pretty good approach.</p>

<p>It’s basically a table of pre-compiled <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/"><code>regexp</code></a> objects with a little 21-line routing function that loops through them, and calls the first one that matches both the path and the HTTP method. Here are the routes and the <code>Serve()</code> routing function:</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Path parameters are handled by adding the <code>matches</code> slice to the request context, so the handlers can pick them up from there. I’ve defined a custom context key type, as well as a <code>getField</code> helper function that’s used inside the handlers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>ctxKey</span> <span>struct</span><span>{}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>getField</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fields</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>(</span><span>ctxKey</span><span>{})</span><span>.</span><span>([]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fields</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A typical handler with path parameters looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Handles POST /api/widgets/([^/]+)/parts/([0-9]+)/update</span>
<span>func</span> <span>apiUpdateWidgetPart</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>slug</span> <span>:=</span> <span>getField</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>:=</span> <span>strconv</span><span>.</span><span>Atoi</span><span>(</span><span>getField</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"apiUpdateWidgetPart %s %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>slug</span><span>,</span> <span>id</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I haven’t checked the error returned by <code>Atoi()</code>, because the regex for the ID parameter only matches digits: <code>[0-9]+</code>. Of course, there’s still no guarantee the object exists in the database – that still needs to be done in the handler. (If the number is too large, <code>Atoi</code> will return an error, but in that case the <code>id</code> will be zero and the database lookup will fail, so there’s no need for an extra check.)</p>

<p>An alternative to passing the fields using context is to make each <code>route.handler</code> a function that takes the fields as a <code>[]string</code> and returns an <code>http.HandleFunc</code> closure that closes over the <code>fields</code> parameter. The <code>Serve</code> function would then instantiate and call the closure as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>handler</span> <span>:=</span> <span>route</span><span>.</span><span>handler</span><span>(</span><span>matches</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>:</span><span>])</span>
<span>handler</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then each handler would look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>apiUpdateWidgetPart</span><span>(</span><span>fields</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandlerFunc</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>slug</span> <span>:=</span> <span>fields</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>:=</span> <span>strconv</span><span>.</span><span>Atoi</span><span>(</span><span>fields</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
        <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"apiUpdateWidgetPart %s %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>slug</span><span>,</span> <span>id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I slightly prefer the context approach, as it keeps the handler signatures simple <code>http.HandlerFunc</code>s, and also avoids a nested function for each handler definition.</p>

<p>There’s nothing particularly clever about the regex table approach, and it’s similar to how a number of the third-party packages work. But it’s so simple it only takes a few lines of code and a few minutes to write. It’s also easy to modify if you need to: for example, to add logging, change the error responses to JSON, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="regex-switch">Regex switch</h2>

<p>The second approach still uses regexes, but with a simple imperative <code>switch</code> statement and a <code>match()</code> helper to go through the matches. The advantage of this approach is that you can call other functions or test other things in each <code>case</code>. Also, the signature of the <code>match</code> function allows you to “scan” path parameters into variables in order to pass them to the handlers more directly. Here are the routes and the <code>match()</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>Serve</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>h</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Handler</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>slug</span> <span>string</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>id</span> <span>int</span>

    <span>p</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>URL</span><span>.</span><span>Path</span>
    <span>switch</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>match</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>,</span> <span>"/"</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>h</span> <span>=</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>home</span><span>)</span>

        <p>There’s an italian Facebook page called “<strong>Il Programmatore di Merda</strong>” (which can be translated to “<strong>The Shitty Programmer</strong>”). I love that page.</p>
<p>They often share shitty pieces of code and memes about programming, but today I’ve seen something quite incredible:</p>

<p>There are so many wrong things in here that I don’t know where to start.<br>
If you’re a junior developer, this post will help you to understand some very bad errors written in the code above.</p>

<p>Let’s write down the above code, so that we can discuss about it:</p>

<p>Ok, I don’t really know where to start.<br>
Let’s divide the errors above in 3 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#security-issues">Security issues</a></li>
<li><a href="#basic-programming-knowledge">Basic programming knowledge</a></li>
<li><a href="#code-formatting">Code formatting</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-issues">
Security issues
</h2>
<p>We are pretty sure that the following code is running on the client side, ’cause it’s wrapped between two <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags (also, is using jQuery).<br>
Don’t get me wrong, it would have been terrible even on the server side, but running that code on the client exposes your database to… everyone.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the <code>authenticateUser</code> function:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>function</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>  <span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>    <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>  )<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>  <span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>accounts</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>    <span>var</span> account <span>=</span> accounts [i]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a>    <span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>        <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a>    <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a>      <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>    <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>"true"</span> <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have a function somewhere called <code>apiServices</code> which exposes a <code>.sql</code> method, where you can run SQL queries against the database.<br>
That means that if you open the console on the web page that is hosting the above code, you’ll be able to spawn every kind of query.<br>
</p>
<p>You could do something like that:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(<span>"show tables;"</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and it will return the complete list of their database tables by using their own APIs.<br>
But hey, ok, let’s pretend that this is not a real problem. But take a look at that:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>    <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>so you’re telling me that you’re saving all the passwords without hashing them?<br>
Great move! Now I can attach a debugger to the Chrome console and see every user’s password.<br>
I’m also pretty sure that an high percentage of users uses the same username/password tuple for social networks, email services, bank accounts and so on.</p>

<p>There’s also a problem on how they’re trying to setup the <code>loggedin</code> cookie:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>So they’re basically using jQuery for setting a cookie which tells to the web application if a user is authenticated or not.<br>
</p>
<p>Well, <strong>NEVER SET THIS KIND OF COOKIES USING JAVASCRIPT</strong>.</p>
<p>If you need to store that kind of information, cookies are the most common choice, and that’s ok! But setting them using JavaScript means that you cannot set the <code>httpOnly</code> attribute, so every single malevolent script will gain access to your cookies.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, they’re just storing a key value like <code>'loggedin': 'yes'</code>, so that’s not the case, but that’s a very bad practice.</p>
<p>Also, opening my Chrome console I could always type <code>$.cookie('loggedin', 'yes', { expires: 1000000000000 });</code> and I will stay loggedin forever without even have an account.</p>
<h2 id="basic-programming-knowledge">
Basic programming knowledge
</h2>
<p>There are so many things to say and so little time.<br>
Obviously the <code>authenticateUser</code> function is pure garbage, and it shows some lacks of basic programming knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>function</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a>  <span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a>    <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>

<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a>  <span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>accounts</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span>) <span>{</span></span>

<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a>        <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span>
<span id="cb6-10"><a href="#cb6-10"></a>    <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-11"><a href="#cb6-11"></a>      <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-12"><a href="#cb6-12"></a>    <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-13"><a href="#cb6-13"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-14"><a href="#cb6-14"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>"true"</span> <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb6-15"><a href="#cb6-15"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-16"><a href="#cb6-16"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb6-17"><a href="#cb6-17"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Instead of selecting every single user inside of the database, why doesn’t he/she select just the user with a given username and a given password?<br>
What if he/she had millions of users in that database?<br>
</p>
<p>I’ve said before and I’ll say it again, <strong>why they’re not hashing passwords inside of their database?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s move on to the returning value of <code>authenticateUser</code>.<br>
For what I see, it takes two arguments of type <code>string</code> and returns a single <code>boolean</code> value.<br>
</p>
<p>So, the following piece of code, even being awful, makes a bit of sense:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>accounts</span>.<span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>  <span>var</span> account <span>=</span> accounts [i]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>  <span>if</span> (<span>account</span>.<span>username</span> <span>===</span> username <span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>      <span>account</span>.<span>password</span> <span>===</span> password)</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a>  <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>    <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>“does an user with <em><strong>X</strong></em> username and <em><strong>Y</strong></em> password exists? Yes, so I’ll return <code>true</code>”.<br>
But this:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>if</span> (<span>"true"</span> <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>  <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This doesn’t make sense at all.<br>
Why doesn’t this function return <code>false</code> without this always-true conditional?</p>
<p>Now let’s analyze the following code:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>$</span>(<span>'#login'</span>).<span>click</span>(<span>function</span>() <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>  <span>var</span> username <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#username"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>  <span>var</span> password <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#password"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a>  <span>var</span> authenticated <span>=</span> <span>authenticateUser</span>(username<span>,</span> password)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a>  <span>if</span> (authenticated <span>===</span> <span>true</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a>    <span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><a href="#cb9-9"></a>  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (authenticated <span>===</span> <span>false</span>) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-10"><a href="#cb9-10"></a>    <span>$</span>(<span>"error_message"</span>).<span>show</span>(LogInFailed)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-11"><a href="#cb9-11"></a>  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-12"><a href="#cb9-12"></a><span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The part where it’s taking the values using jQuery is ok.<br>
The problem is how it’s handling the <code>loggedin</code> cookie.<br>
</p>
<p>We’ve previously talked about the fact that I could just open my Chrome console and type <code>$.cookie('loggedin', 'yes', { expires: 1 });</code> in order to stay authenticated for one day without even the need for an account.<br>
</p>
<p>So, how the heck does this web page know who I am?<br>
Maybe it’s just showing some private content under username/password authentication, so it’s not showing any personal data. No one will ever know.</p>
<h2 id="code-formatting">
Code Formatting
</h2>
<p>Probably the less critical part of the whole code, but we can clearly see that this developer have copied/pasted some code taken from some website.</p>
<p>Here we can see the use of the double quotes for writing strings:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>var</span> username <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#username"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a><span>var</span> password <span>=</span> <span>$</span>(<span>"#password"</span>).<span>val</span>()<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we can see single quotes:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>$</span>.<span>cookie</span>(<span>'loggedin'</span><span>,</span> <span>'yes'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>expires</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This may not look important, but it’s actually telling us that the developer has probably copied some code from StackOverflow without even rewriting it following a common style guide for the whole codebase.<br>
Of course this is a minor issue, but it show that the developer doesn’t really care about understanding how the code is working, it just want it to work in some way.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I do search things on Google daily, but it is more important to understand (for instance) how to set a cookie, than copy and paste something just to make it work.<br>
What if for some reason the whole process breaks? How do you know which part of your script is not working?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m absolutely sure that the code above is fake.<br>
That’s the first time that I see a synchronous SQL query:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2"></a>  <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"><a href="#cb12-3"></a>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Normally, I’d expect something like that:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(<span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span><span>,</span> (err<span>,</span> res) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2"></a>  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(err)<span>;</span> <span>// some error</span></span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3"></a>  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(res)<span>;</span> <span>// query result</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4"><a href="#cb13-4"></a><span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or like that:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1"></a><span>var</span> accounts <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>apiService</span>.<span>sql</span>(</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><a href="#cb14-2"></a>  <span>"SELECT * FROM users"</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><a href="#cb14-3"></a>)<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even if <code>apiService.sql</code> returns a value synchronously (which I doubt), internally it have to open a connection to a database, make a query and send back the response, which (as you may have guessed) can’t be synchronous.<br>
</p>
<p>But even if the code above was not a fake, I’m sure that it has been written by a junior dev.<br>
During my first weeks as a developer, I’m pretty sure I wrote such bad code for my old company (sorry :D).<br>
</p>
<p><strong>It’s not a junior developer fault</strong>.<br>
Let’s pretend that the above code is real. The junior developer here is making its best for making it work.<br>
He/she have yet to learn how to properly handle SQL queries, cookies and other stuff, and that’s totally fine!<br>
</p>
<p>Senior developers should provide some form of mentorship in order to make sure that junior devs can understand their errors, and such bad code won’t go in production.<br>
</p>
<p>I know for sure that there are certain companies that doesn’t really care about the code that they’re shipping.<br>
Does it solve a problem? Deploy it.<br>
Is it written by a junior, without even an approval from a senior dev? Deploy it.<br>
</p>
<p>Shit happens.</p>
<h2 id="update-20200803">UPDATE 2020/08/03</h2>
<p>After discussing this article on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/i1ph52/reviewing_the_worst_piece_of_code_ever">Reddit</a>, a very nice guy reached out sharing the following Reddit thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/66klvc/this_javascript_code_powers_a_1500_user_intranet">https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/66klvc/this_javascript_code_powers_a_1500_user_intranet</a></p>
<p>“<em>This JavaScript code powers a 1,500 user intranet application</em>”</p>
<p>so apparently I was wrong. This piece of code is not fake!</p>

<p><strong><span>A Tale of Two Charts</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows the monthly average <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin">price of bitcoin</a> since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1238" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-26/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png" data-orig-size="782,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-26" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png 782w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px"></figure>



<p>This second chart shows the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=bitcoin">Google Trends Score</a> by month for the search term “bitcoin”, also since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1239" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-27/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-27" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>When I first saw the second chart, I thought it looked remarkably similar to the first. Sure enough, it does. Below are the two charts together. The darker line shows the price according to the left-side axis and the lighter line shows the Google Trends Score according to the right-side axis.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1240" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-28/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png" data-orig-size="783,306" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-28" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>It turns out that bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score are quite correlated.</p>



<p>Specifically, they have had a 72% positive correlation since October 2013. This compares favorably to bitcoin’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-correlation-with-gold-is-weakening-says-new-kraken-report">26% correlation with the stock market and 24% correlation with gold</a> over the last year.</p>



<p>I should note that the correlation between bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score was much stronger up until both price and score peaked in December 2017 (98%) than it has been since (59%).</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the purpose of this analysis is not to argue about the level of correlation nor to assert causation one way or another (though it seems logical that the price and popularity feed off of each other). Rather, the purpose of this analysis is to make a speculative projection regarding what bitcoin’s price could be if and when its popularity (as measured by its Google Trends Score) returns to and surpasses its previous all-time high.</p>



<p>In order to make this projection, we first must consider the historical ratio between bitcoin’s average price and its Google Trends Score on a monthly basis. Let us refer to this as the <em><strong>price:score ratio</strong></em><strong> </strong>for short.</p>



<p><strong><span>Bitcoin’s Price:Score Ratio</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows how bitcoin’s price:score ratio has increased over the last several years.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1241" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-29/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-29" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>For a ratio that has been relatively volatile historically, it has remained unusually consistent for the last two months (June &amp; July) at 729, just 4% short of its all-time high of 758 in November 2019.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s price:score ratio has been above 645 for 9 of the last 12 months after having only reached such a level once before, and barely (646 in October 2018).</p>



<p>The 3 months in the last year during which the ratio was lower than 645 can be fairly easily explained. They took place this past March, April, and May as hype grew in anticipation of bitcoin’s once every four years halving event on May 11, 2020. Additionally, people perhaps were searching more than usual for information about alternative assets (including bitcoin) when the stock market crashed ~30% in the early days of the lockdown resulting from the pandemic. Those two factors together seem sufficient to explain the uptick in bitcoin’s Google Trends Score over that period. On the other side of the price:score ratio, bitcoin’s price fell along with the market, and so with the price going down and the score going up, the decreased price:score ratio over those few months makes sense.</p>



<p>Since the stock market substantially recovered and the halving event came and went without materially moving bitcoin’s price, the Google Trends Score has returned to the pre-pandemic, pre-halving-hype range. For the last two months (June &amp; July), bitcoin’s monthly Google Trends Score has stayed steady at 13, which is equal to its average from April 2018 (after the peak) through February 2020 (before the halving hype and market crash).</p>



<p>For some additional context, it should be noted that bitcoin’s Google Trends Score has only been equal to or greater than 21 in 7 months since bitcoin’s inception and they all took place consecutively surrounding bitcoin’s last major surge from September 2017 through March 2018 (with scores chronologically of 21, 22, 44, 100, 55, 39, and 23).</p>



<p><strong><span>Flying Under The Radar</span></strong></p>



<p>Sufficed to say, bitcoin’s average score of 13 since the last surge, excluding the three aforementioned months from earlier this year (14 if we include them), shows objectively that bitcoin is flying under the radar (in terms of its popularity as a search term at least). Of course, it may not seem this way to people who follow crypto closely and daily but the algorithmic and mass-data collecting Google Trends Score should be trusted over any single person’s speculative and subjective observation about the current level of hype and attention.</p>



<p>If you, like me, believe that bitcoin is and has been flying under the radar for more than two years now, the natural question to ask is this. What do we expect to happen when that is no longer the case? In other words, what happens to bitcoin’s price if and when it reaches the pinnacle of its next hype cycle? How high might bitcoin fly the next time we see a situation similar to that of December 2017?</p>



<p><strong><span>Projecting Bitcoin’s Price</span></strong></p>



<p>I believe a reasonable response to this question can be made by applying bitcoin’s average price:score ratio over the last twelve months (643) to a Google Trends Score of 100 to estimate what bitcoin’s price would be if the price:score ratio stays about constant and bitcoin’s popularity in terms of search returns to its all-time high. The price implied by this projection is about $65,000 as is demonstrated by the maximum value in the top right corner of the chart below. Basically, if one believes that bitcoin will at least at some point return to the level of popularity it attained in December 2017, this methodology would lead that person to expect bitcoin to attain a price of at least $60,000 at that time.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1242" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-30/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png" data-orig-size="783,308" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-30" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>This estimate can be made less conservative in two ways. The first is to assume that the price:score ratio will continue to increase as it has all along (6% month-over-month), rather than calculating the price using the LTM average of the ratio. The second is to assume that bitcoin’s popularity as a search term will well surpass its previous all-time high set in December 2017 just as that all-time was more than twice as great as any high before it and more than 8 times greater than the all-time high before May 2017 (which was set in December 2013, perhaps not coincidentally exactly 4 years or one halving period prior to the latest all-time high). I hesitate to call either of these two less conservative assumptions aggressive because they are not only reasonable but actually probable if one is to simply assume that the historical trends will continue in terms of the score and the ratio.</p>



<p>As such, I will close by presenting a chart which one can use to approximate the price implied by their own inputs for the Google Trends Score and the price:score ratio. In this chart, I show the ratio for the last 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and so on, and use the average year-over-year growth rate between those figures (16%) to project the next twelve months (“NTM”), next two years (“N2Y”), and next three years (“N3Y”) ratios.</p>



<p>The highest price projected on the chart is right around $300,000 based on a Google Trends Score of 3 times the previous all-time high (300) and a projected N3Y price:score ratio of 996 (the LTM average of 643 increased 16% 3 times for 3 years). Of course, this maximum price projection is limited only arbitrarily by the maximums I have decided to present on this chart for both the score and the ratio.</p>

<p><strong><span>To Be Continued…</span></strong></p>



<p>Many people have employed many methodologies in attempting to accurately project bitcoin’s price. For example, <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD">PlanB</a>‘s stock to flow ratio looks at scarcity to make one of the more convincing price projections I’ve seen. My price:score ratio looks at popularity in endeavoring to do the same. This analysis was not intended to be totally comprehensive. My intention was merely to introduce this methodology for others to critique. As such, my hope is that this becomes widely enough read so that I may receive ample critical feedback for further consideration and refinement of the methodology.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every day, we carry burdens of family, job, and community. We manage the load by breaking them into pieces and put them into a to-do list. The agony of life is that the more tasks we tick off the list, the more added. Running faster seems to be the only way out, so we run faster aided by tools, only to discover at the end of a period that we have been running on a treadmill with ever-increasing speed, going nowhere.</p><p>I have run on the treadmill of tasks with panting of disappointment for more weeks than I can count. For reasons I can't explain, enlightenment in life strikes only at the trough of despair. I was reminded of a story in the great Indian epic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, during one of the downcast days. The story goes like this.</p><p><em>I'm paraphrasing the story here, so if you know the story, allow me some latitude.</em></p><blockquote><p>One day, Drona, the teacher, lines up his students to teach archery. He commands them to focus on a bird on a near-by tree. Every student raised their bow and was ready to shoot. <br>
Before they shoot, he walks over to each student and asks them what they see. <br>
“I see the tree, the branch, and the bird” answers the first student. Drona asks him to put the bow down and stand aside. He moves to the next student. <br>
“Tree, branch, and the bird …” The second student repeats the same answer. And the next, and the next. Finally, Drona approaches Arjuna. “What do you see, my favorite boy?” <br>
“The tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird,” Arjuna replied. <br>
“Do you see the tree and the leaves?” Asked Drona. <br>
“No, just the tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird.”  <br>
“Shoot,” commands Drona. <br>
Arjuna releases the arrow and hits the target.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Moral of the story: When you want to achieve something, your attention should be on what you have and what you target. Everything else is noise, and you should shut them out.</p></blockquote><p>I'm no archer, but I can transfer the fundamentals to any domain of interest. I started building a system that embodies the principles of the above story. I have used and fine-tuned the system for long, so I feel sure to share it with you. Here are the fundamental principles behind this system:</p><ul><li>Know the outcomes that you want to achieve</li><li>See the outcomes often</li><li>Create projects to reach the outcomes</li><li>Divide each project into weekly wins</li><li>Win a day</li><li>Review to learn, pat, and adjust</li><li>Iterate this cycle to win the outcomes</li></ul><h2 id="know-the-outcomes">Know the outcomes</h2><blockquote><p>It's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower - Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">The top idea in your mind</a></p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/wins-plan.png" alt=""></p><p>We don't stop thinking about our personal life when we enter the office, and we don't stop thinking of our job when we play with our kids. Thus it is futile to try for a balance; rather, we should integrate all areas of our lives to have a fulfilling life.</p><p>After many iterations, I have found <strong>four areas that encompass all of life</strong>, and if I do well in those areas, I would have a fulfilling life. They are <strong>w</strong>ealth, <strong>i</strong>nsights, <strong>n</strong>etwork, and <strong>s</strong>elf-control.</p><p>For each area, I think of one or two outcomes I want to achieve in three years. The outcomes I want to accomplish in each area in the coming three years looks like this:</p><p><strong>Wealth</strong></p><ul><li>Launch Gravitas WINS course</li></ul><p><strong>Insights</strong></p><ul><li>Learn to run a digital business (Gravitas WINS course)</li></ul><p><strong>Network</strong></p><ul><li>Five mentors &amp; Five Thousand Students</li></ul><p><strong>Self-control</strong></p><ul><li>Stay fit and healthy</li></ul><p>All the projects are related, hence it is easier to remember and think about them cohesively. Because they are cohesive, ideas pop into my head during showers or when I take a walk.</p><p>Once I know the outcomes, I divide them further into quarterly projects and weekly milestones. At any quarter, I run only one or two projects. In this quarter, JAS 2020, I am focusing only on two projects:</p><ul><li>Completing the material for the Gravitas WINS course</li><li>Double the subscribers for this newsletter</li></ul><h2 id="win-the-day">Win the day</h2><blockquote><p>Slow is smooth, smooth is fast - Navy SEALs</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/daily-wins.png" alt=""></p><p>WINS sheet is not a glorified to-do list; it is not even a to-do list by another name. It is a WINS sheet. I enter only those activities that will move me towards the outcome.</p><p>There are always other tasks that I need to do. I do one of the three with those tasks:</p><ul><li>avoid them</li><li>delegate them</li><li>do a good enough job to move on</li></ul><h2 id="reflect-daily--review-weekly">Reflect daily &amp; Review weekly</h2><p>Every day, I reflect on the day that went by.</p><ul><li>Did something catch my attention?</li><li>Did I do something beyond expectation?</li><li>Was I distracted?</li><li>Did I spend too much on movies or YouTube?</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/weekly-reflection.png" alt=""></p><p>Every Sunday night, I sit with the sheet and review the previous week.</p><p>There is always a surprise every week. New things pop up; I completed more than I planned; but most weeks, I completed only 80% of what I intended.</p><p>Since the outcome is clear, I am not disappointed even if I have not completed everything I planned. Eighty percent progress every week towards the outcome is a great move forward.</p><p>When I review every week, I get 54 chances to review and amend my ways.</p><h2 id="adjust-as-you-go-along">Adjust as you go along</h2><p>After the Sunday review, I take a print-out for the next week. I write down the three-year outcome and the quarterly projects again. Repeatedly writing the expected results gives me a moment to consider the outcomes and projects in light of what I know.</p><ul><li>Do these outcomes still make sense?</li><li>Are these projects the best way to achieve the outcomes?</li><li>Is there a way to achieve the outcome differently?</li><li>Can I partner with someone to reach the milestone in half the time?</li><li>Can I use any tool to amplify my efforts?</li></ul><p>I go through these questions, and I adjust the outcomes, projects, and weekly wins. Usually, I don't make any changes to outcomes and projects. But there are always changes to weekly wins.</p><h2 id="drown-out-the-noise">Drown out the noise</h2><p>Going through such routine cement the outcomes in my mind. My unconscious mind reflects these outcomes all the time - when I sleep, work out, or take a shower. My mind doesn't think of anything else. So there is clarity when I sit down to do the work.</p><p>That is how I drown out the noise and win the day.</p><h2 id="wins-productivity-system-is-yours-to-have">WINS productivity system is yours to have</h2><blockquote><p>Move forward three things a mile, not hundred things an inch - Alan Weiss</p></blockquote><p>This system has aided me to publish a <a href="https://www.jjude.com/subscribe/">weekly newsletter</a>, write for <a href="https://www.jjude.com/published-articles/">reputed magazines and newspapers</a>, <a href="https://www.jjude.com/talks/">speak</a> in conferences, amidst consulting as a <a href="https://www.jjude.com/cto/">CTO</a> and <a href="https://www.jjude.com/tags/parenting/">being a dad</a> to two amazing boys.</p><p>If this interests you, subscribe using the below form, and you will get the Weekly WINS sheet for free.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-feel-about-this-essay">How did you feel about this essay?</h3><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJssJLsZXicJA2tlxPVgVvQswNGOftftRLnySkrZsMNNhO7Q/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.13661847=Amazing">Amazing</a> • <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJssJLsZXicJA2tlxPVgVvQswNGOftftRLnySkrZsMNNhO7Q/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.13661847=Good">Good</a> • <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJssJLsZXicJA2tlxPVgVvQswNGOftftRLnySkrZsMNNhO7Q/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.13661847=Meh">Meh</a> • <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJssJLsZXicJA2tlxPVgVvQswNGOftftRLnySkrZsMNNhO7Q/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.13661847=Bad">Bad</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="-codedoc-container"><p><span>Watching <code>The Last Dance</code> was an incredible experience, much more than watching Michael Jordan or specifically to sports - I treated this series as a team building tutorial.<br>
So many team building and personal growth topics were raised there, I just found myself sitting after every episode and thinking on the episode's relevancy to my work as team lead and what I can learn from it.</span></p><p><span><img src="https://shaimendel.dev/docs/assets/last-dance/group-header.jpeg" alt="The Chicago Bulls"></span></p><h2 id="tldr"><span>link</span><span>tl;dr</span></h2><p><span>This blog post is about taking lessons from <code>The Last Dance</code> and applying them to the engineering world. <br>
I'll focus on the processes that took place in the Chicago Bulls that converted them from a great team to the best group of their time.
A lot can be learned from the different approaches that the coaches took and the different behaviors of Michael Jordan that led to this improvement in the team's performance.</span></p><h2 id="comparing-a-basketball-team-with-an-engineering-team"><span>link</span><span>Comparing a basketball team with an engineering team</span></h2><p><span>I'll begin with doing a basic mapping (as I see it) between the series characters to an engineering org:</span></p><ul><li><span>The coach (Phil Jackson and Doug Collins before him) - the team lead</span></li><li><span>Michael Jordan - a senior engineer</span></li><li><span>The rest of the Chicago Bulls team - non-senior engineers in the team</span></li><li><span>Jerry Reinsdorf and the rest of the Chicago Bulls mgmt - different stakeholders, "upper management"</span></li><li><span>The fans and the crowd - customers</span></li></ul><p><span>Now that we have this comparison in mind we can begin with the real fun :)</span></p><h2 id="the-team-leads-approach-to-winning"><span>link</span><span>The team lead's approach to winning</span></h2><p><span>The coach/team lead have a lot on their minds:</span></p><ul><li><span>Satisfying all stakeholders inside the organization - bringing money in by winning/selling</span></li><li><span>Satisfying the fans/customers in the long term</span></li><li><span>Satisfying the team itself - personal growth, ego, salaries</span></li><li><span>Satisfying themselves - let's not forget that the coach/team lead wants to develop and enjoy as well</span><marker><br>
Let's compare the two approaches of the two coaches in the series:

</marker></li></ul><h3 id="doug-collins---win-by-maximizing-reliance-on-michael-jordan"><span>link</span><span>Doug Collins - win by maximizing reliance on Michael Jordan</span></h3><p><span>Doug Collins was a coach that brought great results to the team by putting all the focus on Michael Jordan, all the game moves and tactics were built on Michael Jordan's abilities.
This is an example to a team lead that puts the weight of the team's ability to deliver only on the senior engineers in the team:</span></p><ul><li><span>Difficult and complicated tasks are assigned to the senior engineers</span></li><li><span>The non-senior engineers' purpose is to let the senior engineers run fast and deliver</span></li></ul><p><span>This made the Chicago Bulls a great team because they had one hell of a senior engineer :) but they could not win the championship.
There are a lot of disadvantages to this approach:</span></p><ul><li><span>The team's ability to deliver is equal to the senior engineers' ability to deliver</span></li><li><span>The ability to improve is equal to the ability of specific senior engineers to improve</span></li><li><span>This is not scalable and relies too much on too few people in the team</span></li><li><span>The non-senior team members do not improve, this approach perpetuates the current "snapshot" of the team - the seniors will stay seniors, the non-seniors will not be promoted.</span></li></ul><p><span>So even though the results were good, they were not great. Remember all the concerns team leads have on their minds? this approach led to unsatisfied internal stakeholders (not winning the championship), unsatisfied fans/customers (not winning the championship =&gt; the product quality was limited and did not improve), unsatisfied team (they were all a shadow of the senior engineer with no future to be seniors themselves), which makes the team lead itself unsatisfied - and who can blame them, how can you be satisfied when everyone around you is not?</span></p><h3 id="phil-jackson---win-by-maximizing-the-team-performance"><span>link</span><span>Phil Jackson - win by maximizing the team performance</span></h3><p><span>Phil was hard to process for the team, he arrived with a completely different approach which turned upside down the way the team behaved so far. <br>
The discussions and plans moved from "what can we do to make Michael Jordan score?" to "what can we do to win in the long term?". This is a huge difference that made the real change in the group. <br>
Phil put emphasis on team building, made everyone focused on the target of winning and to rely on each other. "There is no I in team". <br>
Phil was a true inclusive leader, fostering collaboration (reducing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a>) and not necessarily hiring new team members for their resume but their ability to complement the team.</span></p><p><span>After some adaption time there was a huge difference in the team performance that led to winning the championship. All the disadvantages from before disappeared:</span></p><ul><li><span>The team's ability to deliver is equal to the entire team's ability to deliver</span></li><li><span>The ability to improve is equal to the entire team's ability to improve</span></li><li><span>This is as scalable as it can get - it relies on everyone in the team</span></li><li><span>The non-senior team members improve because the senior team members push them to excellence</span></li></ul><p><span>This approach makes the stakeholders, fans/customers and the team satisfied.<br>
When you put weight on the long term goal and make sure everyone on the team improves you get the best outcomes. Focusing on one person or on short term goals (winning only the next game and not the next seasons) doesn't get you to your maximum. No shortcuts here.</span></p><p><span><img src="https://shaimendel.dev/docs/assets/last-dance/mj-and-dennis-rodman.jpeg" alt="Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman"></span></p><h2 id="the-role-of-the-senior-team-member"><span>link</span><span>The role of the senior team member</span></h2><p><span>Doug Collins believed that the senior engineer's responsibility is to bring success by leading the team and carry it forward.<br>
Phil Jackson believed that the senior engineer's responsibility is to bring success by pushing the team to excellence "from behind", being a servant leader that defines success by the team's success and not by personal success.
<br></span></p><blockquote><p><span>Phil: There is no I in team <br>
Michael: But there is an I in win <br></span></p></blockquote><p><span>This is a conversation that blew my mind, it shows so clearly the difference between the two approaches. The problem is they are both right :)
It took time for Michael Jordan to understand that there is indeed an I in win, but it had a different meaning than what he used to think. <br>
Michael Jordan was a critical senior engineer in the team's success:</span></p><ul><li><span>He pushed the other team members to excellence during practices. He expected them more, pushed them to be better. He had high expectations of them</span></li><li><span>He pushed the other team members to excellence during games</span></li><li><span>He helped the team to stay focused when their spirit took a hit. Michael could stay focused and perform even when they were losing, and this approach led others to play accordingly</span></li></ul><p><span>During their time under Phil's leadership, the best time this group has ever had, Michael wasn't the only scorer, the game tactics did not focus on Michael, and it took him time to process it. There is really no I in team.<br>
When Michael saw the results of this new approach he was convinced that there is definitely <code>an I in win</code>, but only as part of a team.
<p>
The series demonstrated so well the most effective way we can define the senior engineer role:</p></span></p><ul><li><span>The senior engineer's success criteria is the team's performance and not just their personal performance</span></li><li><span>Improve yourself by making others better - don't be frustrated if the there is a gap of knowledge between yourself and the team, see it as an opportunity of personal growth and have high expectations from your team mates</span></li></ul><h2 id="living-in-a-roller-coaster"><span>link</span><span>Living in a roller coaster</span></h2><p><span>Basketball/engineering team's life is like a roller coaster, you sometimes get super high after a win and sometimes get depressed by a devastating loss. It is hard to create a strong team spirit like that, and I found the way the Chicago Bulls coped with it very interesting and we should all apply it to our engineering teams:</span></p><ul><li><span>Celebrate successes</span></li><li><span>Learn from mistakes</span></li><li><span>Anyway, either after a win or a loss - stay focused</span></li></ul><p><span>Every topic here should not be underestimated, it is a crucial part of forming a healthy team culture and identity while keep focusing on the right direction.</span></p><h2 id="summary"><span>link</span><span>Summary</span></h2><p><span>In case you did not watch The Last Dance from an engineering standpoint - I encourage to do it :) <br>
Hoped you enjoyed my take on the series!</span></p></div></div>]]>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>So you are sort of saying that an engineer solves problems, and problems are experienced (mostly) by people, so to solve problems effectively you a) have to deal with people and b) have to really know how to solve the problem (e.g. dealing with infrastructure, performance, etc.) instead of only the parts you are comfortable with. Is that correct?</p></div><div><p>How much of this comes down to the attitude of the engineer? And how much of this comes down to actively studying?Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>In my experience, almost 100% of that learning comes from hard won experience.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>When I studied at university, I was really surprised to discover that the "Computing" courses that I was interested in were labelled as "Software Engineering". I thought it was odd at the time; I never really had thought it about it before, and I was even a bit worried that I might have been signing up for the wrong course!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I don't think many universities at the time offered "Computer Science" as an undergrad course; it's a very different discipline.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took me a LONG time to get my head around the fact that one of the words in the job was "engineering". And really the only way I realised that was after years of working building software. At some point the penny dropped that I was an engineer, and that writing code was only 1 aspect of that job.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>There are a number of things that people starting off in a career of Software Engineering should try and keep in mind.</p></div><div><div><ol>
<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

I look at React, which might help me get a job, and unlike with Rails, I know none of that currently. And then there are tangential things, for example improving my git skills.</p></div><div><p>It feels confusing, especially without a job where problems to solve aren't put in your plate. And it feels confusing because I can doÂ&nbsp;<em>enough to create</em>. I could probably build most things in my mind with Rails and a standard html.erb + scss front end... but while I would learn something, I wouldn't be learning in leaps and bounds in the same way I was when I was learning Ruby/Rails for the first time. I guess what I'm saying is that, in some ways, my ability to create is separated from my need to make drastic educational strides - so it is confusing to know what to focus on.</p></div><div><p>If you were in my shoes what would you be optimising for?

  <div><p>A good rule of thumb for things like personal projects. If you want to learn something new, build the project with new tools, languages and frameworks. If you want to actually build a project, use what you know. So it depends what the point of the project is. I guess if you want to do both you have to just accept that it will take longer using whatever new shiny stuff youâ€™re using.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Tech and software engineering has always been obsessed with the new thing. People just canâ€™t help themselves! Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re just working by yourself and playing around with a new language or framework, but if you are making those decisions on behalf of an employer with a large team, you can easily burn millions of pounds by making the wrong choice. The hard part of all this is making consistently right choices given varying contexts and requirements.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>This goes back to what I was saying about engineering. It is not just coding. Itâ€™s the ability to understand a new technology, digest what is good and bad about it, consider it subjectively and then make a decision based on all that information. Good engineers will be good at that, and will be opinionanted about it as well. Being careful and conservative when they need to be, and working on the cutting edge when it makes sense.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I would recommend not trying to do 4 new things at once. So if you want to learn Flutter or React Native, donâ€™t then something totally foreign for the backend API. Just take it one step at a time. That way you will strike a balance between the fear and excitement of learning something new, and without the admitted drudgery of knocking out features that have no interesting aspects.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>A product, an application, a website, the success of all these do depend on the functionalities built into them. But answer to some questions like “How easy they were to use? How easy were they to understand? Did they do the job without any errors?”, ‘quality’ becomes the most important factor of it all.</p>



<p>A developer may build the functionality but a tester determines the quality of the software and how well they were built.</p>



<p>Google defines Quality as “the standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind; the degree of excellence of something”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, quality for obvious reasons is a very important aspect of any product or service. It, clearly, can be highly subjective. To remove the ambiguity around quality, it becomes essential to set up methods and processes to define or verify the quality of a product for the people involved in making the product and for the people who use the product.</p>



<p>When we talk about quality in terms of a software application, we also hear the term ‘Testing’&nbsp; a lot. They seem to be used interchangeably.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is not just about Testing or just about Quality, is it? There are more terms like Quality Assurance and Quality Control which again are quite often confused with Testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality, these three are supposed to be different yet related to each other and form different parts of the quality management cycle. In this blog, we will take a look at these 3, their importance and how they can be used to make the product better.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Quality Assurance?</strong></h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.yourdictionary.com/quality-assurance" target="_blank">Yourdictionary.com</a> defines quality assurance as “A system for evaluating performance, as in the delivery of services or the quality of products provided to consumers, customers, or patients.”</p>



<p>Quality Assurance(QA) is a standard process set up by an organization to meet quality standards. This process helps to avoid mistakes and defects in the end delivered product and services to customers. </p>



<p>QA is the foundation pillar for quality management as it focuses on the integrity of the product. It also provides confidence to stakeholders that desired and mentioned requirements are fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is Quality Control?</strong></h2>



<p>Quality Control is defined as “the process of setting standards and testing to make sure something, like a product or service, is done correctly.”</p>



<p>The goal of quality control is to check whether the prescribed model was followed or not. It can be achieved by performing audits and determining whether the team followed the defined model to attain quality.</p>



<h2><strong>Origin</strong></h2>



<p>Both Quality Assurance and Quality control are interrelated. They are essential parts of quality management protocols followed by an organization. Initially, Quality control started to be followed in the 1920s by the manufacturing industry. </p>



<p>The Quality control guidelines need to be put in place as the manufacturing industry demands the same replicas of the original product in bulk without any variations. The Quality control process helps them check if the desired requirements were met without committing any mistakes.</p>



<p>With passing years, more research work and Growing technology made the manufacturing process more complex.&nbsp; This made the Quality control process even more complex. </p>



<p>This made the organization define a proper quality control process and ensure it is being followed throughout the development of that particular unit.</p>



<p>In the 1950’s, The process of&nbsp; Quality Control was further extended in the manufacturing unit by performing&nbsp; Quality Assurance checks and Audits. The major areas of focus were the sectors related to public health and safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The idea behind “Assurance” was to randomly select any manufactured piece from the batch and check if it meets the desired requirement. If the piece is found to meet the requirement it is passed. </p>



<p>If the piece did not match the exact requirement but was within defined range it may be passed. If it is found out of defined range, it has to be rejected and can lead to immediate stopping of the manufacturing process and starting it all over again from scratch leading to loss of money and time.</p>



<p>Quality control focuses on auditing the project and checking if defined guidelines and protocols were followed while manufacturing or not.</p>



<h2><strong>Quality Control: What role quality audits and inspection play in product development?</strong></h2>



<p>Quality Audits are the onsite evaluation of a process to ensure their compliance with the requirements. They are performed under the supervision of an auditor who checks whether set guidelines were practised during the making of the product.</p>



<p> Audits are not about checking the product quality but to inspect the type of work done in making a product. It evaluates how closely the prescribed model was followed. Are there any variations? If yes, then the reason behind variations?</p>



<p>The objective of audits is to continuously improve the quality of the work henceforth increasing product quality. Inspection can be one of the aspects of Audit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inspection examines the traits of a product. It checks how well the product fits requirements, are there any variation between developed product and desired product. If yes, it will fit the requirement or not. How many load/stress products can handle? Which adverse situation can make it crash?</p>



<p>In short, the audit is all about examining the quality of the process used while making a product. Inspection is about examining how well the product fits the requirement provided by stakeholders.</p>



<p>Quality and inspection are being practised in a wide variety of industries such as software, manufacturing, automobile, retail, etc. to ensure a standard procedure and practice is being followed by all. </p>



<p>As in bulk manufacturing, any deviation from the standard procedure might lead to mistakes which can result in loss of a huge amount of money and time.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Testing?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://testsigma.com/automated-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing</a> is the process to check if the designed product behaves as required when subjected to various conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The requirements are documented in the form of test cases. The tester verifies and validates the product. If the product requirement under test behaves as expected, the test case is marked as pass or else fail. </p>



<p>The defect is raised by the tester for the failed scenarios and assigned to the developer. Once the defect is fixed by the developer again the requirement is tested to verify the fix and the corresponding case is passed. It is important to have these feedback loops at every stage of the product delivery lifecycle.</p>



<p>By documenting requirements and corresponding testing results, we get a clear picture of how testing is progressing, what procedures are being followed, what is pending, what is the current success rate. Some of the pointers which are&nbsp; defined by testing are:</p>



<p>1. Code and function coverage</p><p>2. The traceability matrix helps define each requirement and has at least one case mapped to it.&nbsp;</p><p>3. percentage of automation vs. manual testing&nbsp;</p><p>4. number of test case executed</p><p>5. Total number of cases passed</p><p>6. Total number of cases failed</p><p>7. The number of defects raised and fixed.</p>



<p>The testing process cannot be subjected to one model as they are various kinds of tests that a product undergoes. Each type of testing has different goals to fulfil. For example, <a href="https://testsigma.com/regression-testing/functional-regression-testing" target="_blank">Functional testing</a> will only check for the conformance to requirement. </p>



<p>Whereas, non-functional testing will check other aspects of requirements such as how an application would behave when subjected to heavy load. </p>



<p>Hence, it is almost impossible to follow one model throughout testing and achieve the desired result. If you try following one model throughout testing scope they are high chances of missing on some essential requirements.</p>



<h2><strong>How testing can help make your product better?</strong></h2>



<p>Testing is documenting each requirement in the form of scenarios and verifying it. Good testing requires a lot of thoughtful work and experience. </p>



<p>Experience makes you understand the requirement better and helps design crisp and clear test cases without missing on any requirement. A good test case should include both positive and negative scenarios.</p>



<p>Each documented requirement is tested. The first step to good testing activity is proper communication. Communication should not be limited to documents being mailed back and forth. </p>



<p>It should involve an open conversation. Each member of the team can speak to anybody and clear their doubts. This helps ensure all team members are on the same page.</p>



<p>Healthy team environment also assures good testing.&nbsp; If coordination is lagging between teammates the problem needs to be addressed and fixed. </p>



<p>Good testing checks what impact any newly introduced or suggested way of working can bring to the existing system and how it can help the team and users in a better way.</p>



<p>Good testing challenges assurance. It checks for all possibilities and their outcomes. The testing activity should be incorporated from the requirement phase as it helps provide better feasibility of requirements, what assumptions to be made, how products can be tested effectively, what cannot be tested, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good testing provides an excellent end product that in turn yields high customer satisfaction. Thus, fulfilling the goal of Quality management system. </p>



<p>Hence, to deliver an apt end product testing plays a key role in the development of the product. Without testing, it would be difficult to say that a developed product is bug-free and right.</p>



<p>Early testing, often testing and performing as much as possible is the only key for a high customer satisfaction rate and application to be a success. Continuously working on customer feedback, testing and delivering the product as per their need is the only way to thrive in a competitive market.</p>



<h2><strong>Finally, what is the relationship between QA, QC and Testing</strong>?</h2>



<p>To sum up, Quality assurance makes sure that correct processes are set up to get a quality product as a result. This also …</p></div></div>

	    	    				    		      	    	<p>In 1963, the people at NASA needed a building. And not just any building. It had to be large enough to be able to assemble the enormous space vehicles NASA designed as part of their massive effort to send astronauts to the Moon. The building that was completed in 1966 allowed for the <em>vertical</em> assembly of rockets like the Saturn V, and it is to this date the largest single-story building in the world. Located at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the “Vehicle Assembly Building” (VAB) is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/718659main_VAB.pdf">160 meters tall, 218 meters long, and 160 meters wide</a>, with a volume 3.75 times that of the Empire State Building, and built to withstand hurricanes. The building is a vast and complex system that includes five overhead cranes used to pick up the heaviest elements of rockets and to place them carefully into position ahead of launch. It also has the largest doors in the world, through which the rockets roll to the launch pads.</p>

<p>Yet, after the Vehicle Assembly Building was completed, it had a surprise in store: It creates its own weather. The building is so vast that, on very humid days, rain clouds form below the ceiling and about 10,000 tons of air conditioning equipment are needed to control the moisture inside. And so it only takes one hour to completely replace the air in the building. Although, rumor has it that the folks at NASA often just leave the doors open…</p>

	    	    				    		      	    	<p>That a building can have its own weather is not only a good story to start a blog post with, but it also teaches us something about the nature of complex systems: They come with unintended consequences and unexpected behavior. “The larger the system, the greater the probability of unexpected failure,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)">John Gall</a> wrote in <em>General Systemantics</em>, his seminal book about how systems work – and how they fail. In the book, <a href="https://archive.org/details/systemantics00john/">which can be borrowed from the Internet Archive</a>, Gall offered many principles of systems design, especially with regards to complex systems. One of those principles has become known as Gall’s Law:</p>

														
	    	    												<figure>
				<blockquote><p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple&nbsp;system.</p>
</blockquote>
					      <figcaption>John Gall, <cite>General Systemantics</cite> </figcaption>
	      	    </figure>
								
	    	    				    		      	    	<p>He might have a point here: Many of the complex systems around us that work, weren’t designed from scratch. They evolved from a simpler system, a basic set of rules and conventions. Nation-states, companies, the World Wide Web – it would have been impossible to design them in all their complexity without failing miserably. And history has seen countless failed attempts at designing complex systems, from <a href="https://urbanutopias.net/2019/06/01/le-corbusier/">Le Corbusier’s radically geometric ideas for urban planning</a> to <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/6/7/18657121/brasilia-brazil-urban-planning-architecture-design">the utopia that is Brasilia</a> to the sinking of the Titanic.</p>

<p>So when you set out to design a system, whether it is a business, a team, its workflows, a website, or a design system, it is good to remember Gall’s Law. A complex system designed from scratch never works. Start with the simplest system you can come up with and enhance it incrementally. Don’t overspecify, but leave enough room so that connections and structures can evolve and grow over time. Loose systems last longer and work better. Lastly, be aware that your system might fail at any time. At least, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">anything that can go wrong will go wrong</a>, right? So also ask yourself: <a href="https://vimeo.com/217697727">How well does it fail?</a> </p>

<p>Designing a simple system is much harder than designing a complex system. But at least you might end up with a system that actually works.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>We can take advantage of the way humans think about value.</em></strong></p><p>We know that the computer you are using is <strong>worth more</strong> than the water bottle that is on the table. That is just something we inherently know. <strong>Why?</strong> Because we probably purchased water in the past, we recognize the price of a computer. We understand that we get more value out of the computer than the bottle of water. Every human has a built-in value meter in which we value products (or services!) comparatively.</p><p>Now, assume I put you in the middle of the desert and don't give you water for two days. Suddenly the value of the water bottle climbs to the top of your value meter.</p><hr><p>When you ask a person directly what they are willing to pay for a bottle of water, they refer to their value meter. They give you an answer based on expectation and comparison rather than on how much they may potentially value it. This happening makes it hard for a person to admit the real value of your product.</p><p>This phenomenon occurs when your product is an innovation, without valid comparisons, or if the value your product provides is much higher than any substitutes available on the market. The customer suddenly does not have an accurate thermometer to measure your product against, and will often give you a much lower price point when asked directly.</p><p>Economists and psychologists have studied this phenomenon for a long time. There are many techniques to gather information on the world-famous question for any startup: <strong>How much should I price my product?</strong></p><p>We can take advantage of this phenomenon by asking the customer indirect questions on a range.</p><hr><p>One of my favorite techniques, which I believe works very well, is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Westendorp%27s_Price_Sensitivity_Meter">Van Westerndorp method</a></strong>, also known as the Price Sensitivity Meter technique. Its a series of 4 simple questions you can ask your customers to determine a price range at which your product pricing matches your offering's real value. </p><p>What better way then to put those questions on a survey and ask enough people. If you survey, say, 150 potential customers, you will discover a pretty accurate price range determined by consumer value. Simple enough? Let's get started.</p><p>The first step is to <strong>make sure that customers understand your product</strong>. Consider giving customers a demo, sharing a video, or showing them detailed pictures of your product. You could include this at the top of your survey. For our purposes, let us take a picture of this yummy Gyro. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I think it would do quite well to price this Gyro.</p><figure><img src="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/gyro.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/gyro.jpg 600w, https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/gyro.jpg 700w"><figcaption>Let's price this Gyro.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The first question you would ask is, at what particular price point is this Gyro way <strong>too expensive</strong> that you would never consider purchasing it?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Then you would ask at what specific price point is this Gyro <strong>getting expensive, but you would still consider</strong> buying it?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>At what price point is this Gyro a really <strong>good deal</strong>?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>And, At what point is this Gyro <strong>too cheap</strong> that you'd question its quality?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Notice the answers would give us a range of prices rather than one fixed price. By answering in ranges, people tend to let go of their value spectrum and instead determine the boundaries of how valuable the product is to them. This technique is, by far, one of the most accurate ways of determining your products true value-based price through a survey.</p><p>Looking at the data for 30+ users, we would get a cumulative graph as shown below.</p><figure><img src="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png" alt="" srcset="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png 600w, https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/PSM-graph-ready.png 933w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Gyro Survey Results</figcaption></figure><p>From the results of the survey above, (about 30 entries at the time of this article.) We notice that the optimal value-based price range is between $2.5 and $3.5. At $2.5, the Gyro has approximately 15% of people who think its both expensive and too cheap. The optimal price would be the intersection of "too expensive" and "too cheap" at $3. Of course, this is just an indication of pricing and based purely on the people you have surveyed!</p><p>For anyone interested, I have created the Gyro survey <a href="https://forms.gle/EML2DwbiaEgFQWoe8">here</a> &nbsp;(feel free to take it!). I have set up a live updating-pricing <a href="https://bit.ly/2X0wQoZ">worksheet</a> to go along with it.</p><p><strong>Feel free to make a copy for your own product pricing journey, and good luck with your product pricing adventures.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>The GIMP team recently informed me that the next upcoming version of GIMP will be GIMP 2.10.22 (no GIMP 3.0 just yet – womp). Though there has been no official announcements of specific features to come in this next version, there has been one feature announcement in particular that has caught my eye – the “<strong>linked layers</strong>” feature.</p>



<h2>Linked Layers – GIMP’s Answer to Photoshop’s Smart Objects?</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zemarmot/status/1286952087558004738?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GIMP quietly announced (via a retweet)</a> that the <a href="https://patreon.com/zemarmot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeMarmot team</a> was working on a new feature they are calling the “Linked Layers” feature (note: this has nothing to do with the “transform link” feature already found in GIMP).</p>



<p>In fact, work for this feature actually began in July 2019 (about a year ago) but, due to limited developers working on GIMP, this feature was shelved until recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jehan from ZeMarmot, who recently revisited development on this feature, described the application of Linked Layers in this way: “What if you wanted to use the same background in several images? Instead of duplicating it, you could just link it from all images using it. And if you edit a bit your common background, it would automatically update the render of all images.”</p>



<p>Sound familiar?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To me, this sounds like GIMP’s version of “Smart Objects” – the popular Photoshop feature that allows you to “link” a different file to your composition, then have that file live update in your current composition any time you make changes to it. This has many applications – especially in the world of creating universal templates that can be updated with your own design (by simply replacing the “linked image” with your own design, then re-saving that image). <strong>This is huge.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It would work like this in GIMP: you would create a new layer, and under “Fill With” you choose “Image Link” (red arrow in the image above). Choosing this option would bring up an option to select an image to link the layer to on your computer (blue arrow). You then select your image, and click “OK” to create your new layer. The layer is now linked to the image on your computer. If you were to then open that image in GIMP and make edits to it, the edits would automatically update in the linked layer inside your other composition.</p>



<h2>Why GIMP’s Linked Layers Will Be Just As Good As Photoshop’s Smart Objects</h2>

<p>Some of you are wondering how this feature would keep pace with Photoshop’s well-established “Smart Objects” feature. In Photoshop, not only can you link a layer from one composition to a layer or image from another composition, but you can also link vector objects from Adobe Illustrator as a layer in Photoshop, and edit that vector object essentially in real-time in either program and have the quality of the vector object remain intact.</p>



<p>Well, GIMP’s “linked layers” will do the exact same thing – using Open Source alternatives, of course. This feature will be integrated with Inkscape so that, for example, you can link a vector composition to a GIMP layer, and have the GIMP layer scale up without quality loss the way any vector object would in Inskcape. <strong>This is mind-blowing.</strong> You could also make updates to the vector file in Inkscape, and those changes would then refresh inside of the linked layer in GIMP. It would essentially create a dynamic link between the two programs.</p>



<p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/N5oyqbD7zyQ">video ZeMarmot released showing this new “linked layers” feature in action.</a> This isn’t just a pipe-dream or concept yet to be implemented – it’s a feature they’ve demonstrated to work in a test-version of GIMP. </p>



<p>If GIMP can successfully get linked layers to work in a stable release version of GIMP, the internet, myself included, will lose its mind. And, once again, GIMP will have successfully taken a bite out of Adobe’s photo editing software lead (still without charging its users a dime).</p>



<p>In my opinion, some form of “smart object” functionality is one of the top 3 features missing in GIMP (and one of the top 3 things I get comments about on my videos – especially when doing PS vs. GIMP comparisons). Stay tuned – I will provide more information on this feature as it comes out (hopefully via a video tutorial if they get the feature implemented in one of the new release-versions of GIMP).</p>



<p>If you want to help speed up the development of this and other cool new features in GIMP, I recommend supporting the <a href="https://patreon.com/zemarmot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare">ZeMarmot team on Patreon</a> so they can spend more time on GIMP development and less time on other jobs to pay their bills.</p>

<p>English to SQL translation is getting better!  Can you guess which of
these queries to find the actor appearing in the most movies (in a fictional dataset)
was written by a human, and which by machine?</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/most_films.png" alt="a human query, or is it"></p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/machine.png" alt="a machine query, or is it"></p>

<p>Well ok yes you probably can, but the point is they are both pretty good!</p>

<p>In early 2019, when I
was looking for published models for text to SQL translation, I had the most joy with one
called <a href="https://github.com/naver/sqlova/">SQLova</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20101381">Hacker News discussion from that time</a>).
SQLova was trained on the <a href="https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL">WikiSQL</a> dataset, a collection of natural
language questions and SQL queries for tables drawn from Wikipedia.
Part of what made SQLova work well was using BERT to transform its input.
<a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/">BERT</a> is a model released in 2018 for generic NLP tasks, trained on
BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia, that led to a wave of
state-of-the-art improvements in all sorts of language problems as
people bolted it on to their models.  That wave continues to this day,
and BERT’s descendants get better and better.</p>

<p>SQLova was limited to queries on a single table, 
which is not the most interesting use to make of relational databases.
In 2018 the <a href="https://yale-lily.github.io/spider">Spider dataset</a> had been released, with questions and queries
involving multiple tables, so I was looking forward to models showing up
trained on that.  <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/IRNet">IRNet</a> come out with a pretrained model in late 2019, and I started
playing with it.  It was great to see joins and more complex clauses
coming into play.  But a downside of work benchmarked on the Spider dataset
was that the benchmark didn’t include what is called “value” prediction
(such as figuring out parameters in a query), and research code developed with
Spider in mind often skipped that.  This makes sense from a research perspective,
but generates incomplete queries.</p>

<p>I noticed a network called <a href="https://github.com/brunnurs/valuenet">ValueNet</a> released recently.
Building on IRNet, it adds on some machinery for guessing values, and generally makes more of an
effort to produce fully executable queries.  I appreciate that.  Let’s try it out!</p>

<p>As a concrete example, let’s use the Sakila database,
as introduced on the <a href="https://www.jooq.org/sakila">jook website</a>.
This is a (fictional) database about movie rentals from physical stores back
when that was a thing.  It has 16 tables, with a rich relational
structure:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/sakila.png" alt="a database schema"></p>

<p>On the <a href="https://www.jooq.org/sakila">jook website</a>, they give an
example of a (human-written) query that “finds the actor with most films”:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/most_films.png" alt="human query for acting-est actor"></p>

<p>Let’s see what ValueNet can do:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_id.png" alt="machine query for acting-est actor"></p>

<p>(I wrote movies rather than films because I’ve lived in the United
States too long, but it works either way).
The SQL looks plausible!  It picked the right tables, relations,
and aggregations. But the answer is just an ID.  Let’s be
more explicit that we want a name:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_first_name.png" alt="give me a name"></p>

<p>Gina!  Looks like the result matches what the human got.  ValueNet gave
us a name, but in a begrudging way, just the first name.  Let’s get
more specific again and ask for a full name:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_full_name.png" alt="a full name"></p>

<p>Neat, it gave us all the name parts in the table.  It didn’t know
how to construct a full name but <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">who does really</a>.
To match the human query, let’s also ask how many films this Gina
person acted in:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/made_most_movies_full_name_and_count.png" alt="how many movies"></p>

<p>That was a pleasant experience.  There was no cherry-picking here, I downloaded
the database and tried it on ValueNet and this is what I got.  It’d be nice if
the network could better guess what full set of information is useful to give, but it was
definitely helpful.  Also, compared to single-table operation in Sqlova, I am
excited to see the network picking good tables to look at from the soup available,
and relating them appropriately.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jooq.org/sakila">jook website</a> goes on to give another
example (human-written) query to “calculate the cumulative revenue of all stores”:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/cumulative_revenue_real.png" alt="human query for revenue"></p>

<p>That’s a mouthful.  Let’s see what ValueNet does:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/cumulative_revenue.png" alt="machine query for revenue"></p>

<p>That’s not bad!  It figured out the relevant tables and columns.
I couldn’t nudge ValueNet to break this down by day though.
Understandable, since there is nothing structured around days
in the database.  I’d expect the next generation of models
to be able to get that kind of thing though, given that
GPT-3 could no doubt write a detailed essay about it.</p>

<p>As a consolation prize, I asked for a break-down by movie, which I got
without fuss:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulfitz.github.io/images/db/revenue_per_movie.png" alt="revenue per movie"></p>

<p>Neat!  And the great thing is, you don’t need to take my word about
any of this, this is not some <a href="https://twitter.com/FaraazNishtar/status/1285934622891667457">massive network behind an invite-only
API</a> like some networks I could mention 😉.  Just go to
<a href="https://github.com/brunnurs/valuenet">https://github.com/brunnurs/valuenet</a>
and follow their instructions.</p>

<p>My experience with research code in this area is that it is often
difficult to run on data outside of the dataset it is benchmarked on,
since the pipeline for pre-processing that data can be hard to nail
down.  I’ve made a docker image specifically for running ValueNet on
fresh data, and without a GPU (since you don’t need it for inference
really).  Also, to make the whole thing self-contained, I ripped out a
use of Google’s Named Entity Recognition API and replaced it with
something from spacy.  If you have docker, and it is configured so it
can use lots of RAM (3GB or so?), then you can do:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>wget https://paulfitz.github.io/files/sakila.db
<span>$ </span>docker run <span>--name</span> valuenet <span>-d</span> <span>-p</span> 5050:5050 paulfitz/valuenet
<span># wait a while</span>
<span>$ </span>curl <span>-F</span> <span>"sqlite=@sakila.db"</span> <span>-F</span> <span>"q=what is the title of the longest film"</span> http://localhost:5050
<span># {"result":{"answer":[["CHICAGO NORTH"]],"sql":"SELECT T1.title FROM film AS T1    ORDER BY T1.length DESC LIMIT 1"},"split":"case_1db37f79-bbfe-4d70-a367-13e785f5e180"}</span>
<span>$ </span>curl <span>-F</span> <span>"sqlite=@sakila.db"</span> <span>-F</span> <span>"q=what is the full name of the actress whose last name is 'WITHERSPOON'"</span> http://localhost:5050
<span># {"result":{"answer":[["ANGELA","WITHERSPOON"]],"sql":"SELECT T1.first_name, T1.last_name FROM actor AS T1 WHERE T1.last_name = 'WITHERSPOON'"},"split":"case_2cbddbed-2704-4037-8a4a-82e9a8a0f3a2"}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There’s more information at <a href="https://github.com/paulfitz/mlsql#valuenet">https://github.com/paulfitz/mlsql</a>.</p>

<p>How we query databases is ripe for a transformation.  Companies have
been developing and releasing natural language interfaces for decades.
But outside of niche uses they’ve so far been more trouble than they
are worth - brittle, inflexible, lacking common sense.
But the field of natural language processing has evolved a lot, to the
point where we now have access to representations that are far more
robust, flexible, and - if not exactly having common sense - encode a
lot of knowledge about relationships between currencies, names,
chronology, phone numbers, movies, discounts, street names, airports,
email addresses, menus, pokemon, and so on.
I’m looking forward to database query engines that know know more of that!</p>

<p>It's been a while I have done much with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. When I was trying it out with simple state management, in-built hooks, basic styling and managing events, I thought, why not to build something useful? That's when the idea of building a simple, light-weight <code>notification-timeline</code> came into my mind.</p>
<p>So what is notification-timeline? </p>
<ul>
<li>As the name indicates, it notifies you sooner a notification arrives.</li>
<li>It helps you in reading through your notifications in timed sorted manner. That's where the timeline comes from.</li>
<li>You can mark the notifications as read.</li>
<li>You can identify what notification was received and when. </li>
<li>Few more customization capabilities that we will discuss bit later.</li>
</ul>
<p>How does it look?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The basic look and feel contains a bell icon along with a number of unread notifications for you to look into.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596200894152/IAyZ5bz-i.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="1.png"></p>
</li>
<li><p>You click on the bell icon to open up a pop-over to read the notifications and mark them as read, if required.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596196428932/MY3VUo_vo.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="2.png"></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this article, I am going to explain some source code at the high level. Please stick to it. I am sure, you will have some take-away from it. </p>
<p>In case, you want to get to the code or the demo early, here are the details:</p>

<p>Please give it a try and let me know how it goes. Almost nothing is bug free! Feel free to be a contributor if you would like to find-try-fix bugs or add features to it. You are most welcome.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading through so far! This section of the article is going to explain few important parts of the source code and the basic logic around it. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/atapas/notifyme/blob/master/NotifyMe.js">Here</a> is the direct link to the component file.</p>
<h2 id="first-is-the-data">First is the data</h2>
<p>The <code>notification-timeline</code> component expects data in the following format,</p>
<pre><code> [
     {
       <span>"update"</span>:<span>"70 new employees are shifted"</span>,
       <span>"timestamp"</span>:<span>1596119688264</span>
     },
     {
       <span>"update"</span>:<span>"Time to take a Break, TADA!!!"</span>,
       <span>"timestamp"</span>:<span>1596119686811</span>
     }
  ]
</code></pre>
<p>The object must have two properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>timestamp: The timestamp of the time a message was generated. This must be of type long that represent a timestamp value.</li>
<li>update: The message to show as notification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The key names, <code>timestamp</code> and <code>update</code> can be customized as explained in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/atapas/notifyme#properties">properties section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="states-to-manage">States to manage</h2>
<p>The hook <code>useState</code> returns a pair. First is the current state and second is an updater function. We usually take advantage of  <code>array destructuring</code> to assign the values. The initial state value can be passed using the argument. </p>
<p>The notification component manages few states using <code>useState</code>,</p>
<ul>
<li>To show the unread message count<pre><code> <span>const</span> [showCount, setShowCount] = useState(<span>false</span>);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>How many unread messages<pre><code> <span>const</span> [messageCount, setMessageCount] = useState(<span>0</span>);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>To show the message panel on click of the bell icon<pre><code> <span>const</span> [show, setShow] = useState(<span>false</span>);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>To set the click target of the message panel<pre><code> <span>const</span> [target, setTarget] = useState(<span>null</span>);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>To maintain a read index. This is to determine, how far the messages were read so that the unread messages can be shown with a different style.<pre><code> <span>const</span> [raedIndex, setReadIndex] = useState(<span>0</span>);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="handle-the-side-effects">Handle the side effects</h2>
<p>The hook <code>useEffect</code> is used for handling any sort of side effects like, state value changes, any kind of subscriptions, network requests etc. It takes two arguments, first a function that will be invoked on the run and, an array of the values that will run the hook. </p>
<p>It runs by default after every render completes. However we can make it run whenever a particular value changes by passing it as the second parameter. We can also make it run just once by passing an empty array as the second parameter.</p>
<p>Notification component handles the side effect of the data changes. Whenever a new notification arrives, the data gets muted and we need to handle this side effect.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
        <span>if</span> (!sortedByKey) {
            data.sort((a, b) =&gt; b[key] - a[key]);
        }

        <span>let</span> readItemLs = reactLocalStorage.getObject(storageKey);
        <span>let</span> readMsgId = <span>Object</span>.keys(readItemLs).length &gt; <span>0</span> ? readItemLs[<span>'id'</span>] : <span>''</span>;

        <span>let</span> readIndex = (readMsgId === <span>''</span>) ? data.length : 
                           data.findIndex(
                               elem =&gt; 
                                   elem[key] === readMsgId);


        readIndex === <span>-1</span> ? readIndex = data.length : readIndex;
        setReadIndex(readIndex);

        (data.length &amp;&amp; readIndex) &gt; <span>0</span> ? 
            setShowCount(<span>true</span>) : setShowCount(<span>false</span>);
        setMessageCount(readIndex);

    }, [data]);
</code></pre>
<p>On data change,</p>
<ul>
<li>Check and sort by timestamp, if required.</li>
<li>We track the last read message by adding the timestamp of it into the local storage. We check if any last read item id is in the local storage.</li>
<li>We set the message count, last read index accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-render-part">The render part</h2>
<p>Last, the render part. We have a bell icon that shows the unread message count and method to handle the click event.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"notification-container"</span>&gt;
    <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span> = 
              {
                 <span>showCount</span> ? 
                   '<span>notification</span> <span>notify</span> <span>show-count</span>' <span>:</span> 
                       '<span>notification</span> <span>notify</span>'
               }
           <span>data-count</span>=<span>{messageCount}</span>
            <span>onClick</span>=<span>{event</span> =&gt;</span> handleClick(event)}&gt;
                    <span>&lt;<span>Bell</span> <span>color</span>=<span>{bellColor}</span> <span>size</span>=<span>{bellSize}</span> /&gt;</span>
     <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Important to note here, we use the <code>data-*</code> attribute to embed custom data. In this case it is the unread message count using the <code>data-count</code> attribute. Read more about HTML data-* attribute <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp">from here</a>.</p>
<p>Next, the <code>handleClick()</code> method handles to show the pop-over with the notification messages. To do that, we just need to update couple of states,</p>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> handleClick = (event) =&gt; {
    setShow(!show);
    setTarget(event.target);
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's all for covering all the important parts here. I have used <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://feathericons.com/">feather icons</a> for the bell icon and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://react-bootstrap.github.io/">react bootstrap</a> for the message pop-over component.</p>

<p>I would like to enhance the code better as in, I can make it more precise and short. There are lots of scope to improve this component with additional features like,</p>
<ul>
<li>Showing total message count.</li>
<li>Mark as unread.</li>
<li>Limiting the total number of notifications and flush out.</li>
<li>Read/Unread Selected notification messages.</li>
<li>Delete all the notification messages.</li>
<li>Better persistence hook, other than the browser local storage.</li>
<li>Better look-and-feel.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all for now. I am happy to share my learning with you and that's motivates me further to learn more.</p>

    published july 11th, 2019
  
</span>

  
    
    <p>I’m sure you’ve come across the age-old, opinion-based debate of ‘Tabs vs. Spaces’ for <em>indentation</em> before. It has been going since forever, and there seem to be valid reasons for both sides:</p>
<p><strong>Tabs…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>smaller files because it’s just 1 character</li>
<li>that’s what they’re used for</li>
<li>you can customize your own indentation width (👈 keep this one in mind)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spaces…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to avoid problems in whitespace-sensitive environments</li>
<li>because you know what you’ll get, and consistency is key</li>
</ul>
<p>But, there’s more to this than just personal preferences. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChaseMoskal">u/ChaseMoskal</a> recently posted a very insightful and eye-opening post on Reddit with the title <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs/">“Nobody talks about the real reason to use Tabs over Spaces”</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-one-real-reason-to-use-tabs-over-spaces">The one real reason to use tabs over spaces</h2>
<p>In his post, Chase explains his own experience of using spaces at his workplace, and the negative effects it had on co-workers with visual impairment.</p>
<p>One of his co-workers uses a tab-width of <code>1</code>, to avoid huge indentations when using a large font-size.</p>
<p>Another co-worked of his is using a tab-width of <code>8</code> because that works best for his situation with a wide monitor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see people saying “tabs lets us customize our tab-width”, as though we do this “for fun” — Chase</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By using tabs in our projects, we allow these kinds of customizations that are <em>essential</em> for people with visual impairment. Custom tab-widths might seem like an unnecessary thing to most, but some people rely on it—and we <em>can not</em> ignore that.</p>
<h2 id="accessible-first">Accessible first</h2>
<p>We simply can’t “convert” everyone to one side or the other, there’s no question about it. Everyone has their own preferences, and we should celebrate that freedom—that we have the ability to make our own choices.</p>
<p>But with that said, we should also make sure to include <em>everyone</em>, and that means respecting and using accessible tools like the Tab-character.</p>
<p>Much like designing for ‘mobile first’—making sure everyone, no matter what device, has a great experience with your product—we should create an ‘<strong>accessible first</strong>’ environment, by making sure that everyone has the same ability to work, whether it’s at the workplace or on an open-source project.</p>
<p>I thought Chase put it perfectly when he said in his post that <em>"…there’s just no counter-argument that even comes close to outweighing the accessibility needs of valued coworkers”</em>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion--accessible-first-personal-preference-second">Conclusion — Accessible first, personal preference second</h2>
<p>By defaulting to tabs, we make sure that everyone has a great experience working together with others, no matter their own abilities.</p>
<p>And if you prefer spaces, feel free to use an auto-formatting tool that converts tabs to spaces when opening a file (all modern editors have these). Just make sure that the spaces get converted back to tabs before anyone else has to work on your code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only by making sure everyone has the same capability can we maximize our combined potential ❤️</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-did-i-get-started-">How did I get started?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p> “If you’re going to fail, do it fast.” — Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like any other software engineer, I’ve had different types of technical interviews - from the dreaded whiteboard coding interview to the unreal 45-minute coding challenge on platforms like HackerRank. While some of my experiences in these interviews were great, others were bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>But I wanted to get really good at interviewing. I wanted to learn to overcome the interviewing phobia and exude confidence at interviews. Like a skilled surfer, I wanted to learn to ride the high pressure waves that came with interviews. I was also looking to change jobs at the time.</p>
<p>So from January through early March 2020, I applied to and was contacted by companies based in the US and Europe. From early-stage startups like Coda to later stage startups like Crunchbase, from mid-size companies like Affirm, to bigger companies like Amazon and even remote companies like Webflow.</p>
<p>109+ applications later, I landed myself more than 60 interviews. These comprised more than 60 introductory phone interviews, 50+ technical phone screen interviews, 18 take-home coding projects, 11 coding challenges and 8 on-site interviews including 3 virtual ones.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-learn-">What did I learn?</h2>
<p>For better appreciation, I have grouped the lessons into three categories to match the different phases of a typical recruitment process.</p>
<h3 id="pre-interview-phase">Pre-Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything from the initial contact with a company to the point where the first interview happens.</p>
<h4 id="1-what-i-learned-about-applications">1. What I learned about applications</h4>
<p>When I started applying to companies, I imagined that the more applications I submitted, the higher my chances of getting an interview would be. Seems logical, huh? So I set a target of 5 applications a day, aiming for 1 interview for every 5 applications.</p>
<p>But my strategy didn’t work as I hoped it would. The number of interview requests I got often fell short of my target. It was almost a 1:12 ratio - 1 interview for every 12 applications.</p>
<p>I was faced with the question: do I need to increase my daily target to, say, 10 companies? Or was there something else I needed to change?</p>
<p>With every unsuccessful application, I saw that something needed to change.</p>
<p>That change came when I took a break from meeting my daily numbers and began to think of my applications differently. I began to see each application as a sales pitch to the hiring manager or whoever was going to be reading my application, but here the product being sold was me.</p>
<p>If a company needed to fill a talent gap and I say I had the skills, I needed to find a way to convince them that I did.</p>
<p>My new task then became to find a way to effectively pitch my unique skills, experience and personality in a way that convinced the hiring manager that I was the right fit for the job.</p>
<p>Here is an example of one of such <em>pitches</em> I came up with:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596030331456/A8nDIn-ih.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="body image.png"></p>
<p>Backed with my resume, this cover letter had a 95% success rate. The one time this didn’t work, the hiring manager still replied to let me know that the position was no longer available but he would like to connect in the future.</p>
<p>The lesson here is, be very intentional about the application you put forward – quality over quantity. Better still do both. Know your unique competencies and experience and present them in a way that matches the company’s needs without sacrificing your personality.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand the peculiarity of the company you are applying to and its specific needs. A startup or a smaller-sized company may have different needs from a bigger company, thus requiring a different skill-set.</p>
<p>Sell yourself and be sure to back your sales pitch during the interview.</p>
<h4 id="2-what-i-learned-about-recruiter-in-mails">2. What I learned about recruiter in-mails</h4>
<p>During this period, I received a number of in-mails from recruiters (mostly unsolicited) for open roles, the majority of which were roles I wasn’t interested in.</p>
<p>Granted, it was sometimes a lot given my busy schedule but I learned to be empathetic, understanding that these recruiters were only trying to do their jobs.</p>
<p>I stopped seeing these in-mails as noise in my inbox and started making the effort to reply to all recruiter in-mails, even for positions I was not interested in. By doing this, I succeeded in building a network of recruiters that have become a rich resource if I have to switch roles in the future.</p>
<p>Now I don’t expect you may want to start replying to every in-mail you receive. But it might interest you to know that some of the interview requests I got were from recruiters I had replied to before for roles I wasn’t interested in. It never hurts to reply.</p>
<h3 id="the-interview-phase">The Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything about the interview itself, cutting across the different interview types.</p>
<h4 id="3-how-to-handle-introductory-phone-calls">3. How to handle introductory phone calls</h4>
<p>Yes I get it, you’re busy and many things are competing for your time. But hey, you are also an excellent professional, and that means you never get on a phone call without knowing at least these two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first name of your interviewer, and</li>
<li>at least one tangible thing about the company — what they do, where they are located, any recent news, something, anything!</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed that for interviews where I put in the effort to make these findings, I always came across as being genuinely interested in the company. That’s something recruiters typically look for in these kinds of interviews.</p>
<h4 id="4-how-to-handle-technical-phone-screens">4. How to handle technical phone screens</h4>
<p>The one thing that can almost single-handedly decide how well you do in a technical phone screen interview is your ability to communicate your thoughts clearly.</p>
<p>You may have heard stuff like this before:
“<em>The interviewers care about your thought process. Yes they can see your code but importantly, they want to know why you are doing what you’re doing</em>.”</p>
<p>The interviewer isn’t there with you and so does not have the luxury of seeing other non-verbal cues like your hand gestures or nuances. All the interviewer has is your voice as a means of understanding your thought process.</p>
<p>Now you know how you should lead this conversation, the next question is how do you become good at this? Because the truth is, while expressing your thoughts may come naturally to some people, it doesn’t to others – including me.</p>
<p>So – Practice! Practice!! Practice!!!</p>
<p>Practice doing a lot of mock interviews. Doing these mock interviews with friends made me better and more confident in explaining my thought process. But more interestingly, it helped me develop a new mindset about interviews.</p>
<p>I began to see interviews as a conversation with a friend or a team member. I visualized the interviewer on the other end as one of my friends (I sometimes gave the interviewer a name in my head). So what would have been a high-pressure interview I now saw as a friendly ‘chat’ about a technical problem.</p>
<p>This new mindset, aided by the many practice interviews, helped me grow in confidence so much so that I started enjoying interviews, sorry, technical chats.
How to get started on a problem</p>
<p>Never start solving a problem without fully understanding the problem statement. You are almost never wrong if you start by asking clarifying questions. It’s also a good sign to your interviewer when you ask those questions rather than run with your assumptions.</p>
<h4 id="5-how-to-solve-the-problem">5. How to solve the problem</h4>
<p>Good candidates know how to solve a problem (e.g. a sorting problem), but the best candidates know multiple solutions to a problem and understand the trade-offs of one solution versus the other.</p>
<p>The interviews where I performed the best (Cruise comes to mind) are the ones where I didn’t just solve the algorithmic challenge – I was also able to provide alternative solutions and discuss the trade-offs.</p>
<p>Aim to provide multiple solutions to a problem, be willing to discuss the trade-offs, and be able to implement at least one of them.</p>
<p>For technical interviews, write clean code. Most interviewers care about your code quality as well as the correctness of your solution. Aim for modular code, separate reusable logic into utility functions, name variables and methods properly, and just be a boss!</p>
<h4 id="6-what-to-do-when-you-re-stuck-on-a-problem">6. What to do when you’re stuck on a problem</h4>
<p>There will be times when you’re stuck. And this could be caused by a number of reasons: you don’t have the requisite knowledge, incorrect assumptions, missing details, and so on.</p>
<p>I used to think that at such times I was being judged by how fast I could come up with a solution. So I would be quiet, thinking, not communicating with the interviewer, just thinking.</p>
<p>And this is where a lot of us get it wrong. I get it, you need some alone time to think. But sorry to burst your bubble, that alone time is not when you’re being interviewed by a person.</p>
<p>Yes, your interviewer wants to see that you can come up with a solution, but one thing you must not forget is that they also want to see that <strong>you can collaborate with other team-mates to come up with a solution</strong>. While companies want rock-stars, they also want team-players.</p>
<p>Since your interviewer is a friend, a buddy, a team member who’s on your side and means well for you (Refer to 4), talk to them while you're figuring it out.</p>
<p>Share your thought process up till the point you got stuck and do it confidently, not like some cry for help. By doing so you just may uncover the solution, as was the case during my interview with Coda.</p>
<h4 id="7-how-to-handle-coding-challenges">7. How to handle coding challenges</h4>
<p>The lessons here apply to interviews that take the form of coding challenges on platforms like Hackerrank, Codility, and so on. Typically these are timed challenges, say 45 minutes or …</p></div></div>

As I was looking for other educational tools, I found the flipped classroom concept really interesting or even kinda radical. As technology evolves and become more integrated with our lives, we have to find ways to leverage on the strengths of technology to enable us to do more with less. For example, to reach out to more students with less time. Teach more concepts with less classroom time. Have you heard of flipped classroom and what does it mean? We will find out today!</p>

<p>Here’s a video I find really descriptive to help you kickstart your understanding of this pedagogical approach:</p>

<p>In this article, we will be going through the following sections:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>What is Flipped classroom?</li>
<li>What is technology’s role?</li>
<li>Benefits of Flipped classroom</li>
<li>How to get started?</li>
<li>Challenges of flipped classroom</li>

</ol>

<p>Before we begin, I would like to give a shout out to <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://exploreily.wordpress.com/">exploreily</a> for putting together insightful and meaningful articles across many blogs across the world. I’m also featured in their blog as well, so check them out!</p>

<p>Lets dive in first to understand what is Flipped classroom.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#1. What is Flipped classroom?</h2>

<p>The flipped classroom pedagogical approach has two key spaces: the group space which we know as the classroom, and the individual learning space which is student’s personal time outside of classroom.</p>

<p>Flipped classroom essentially moves the group learning such as content teaching from classrooms to their own individual learning space aka outside of classroom. Once that content teaching is done outside of the classroom, your classroom time can now be transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment which students can engage these learnt concepts creatively.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/img/2020-08-01-benefits-challenges-of-flipped-classroom/flipped-classroom-overview.jpg" alt="flipped classroom overview"> <em>The flipped purpose of group and individual time</em></p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Flipped classroom is a “pedagogical approach in which direct instruction moves from the group learning space to the individual learning space, and the resulting group space is transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment where the educator guides students as they apply concepts and engage creatively in the subject matter" (The Flipped Learning Network, 2014)</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#2. What is technology’s role?</h2>

<p>Before we delve right into the benefits of flipped classroom, one has to ask herself:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is the role of technology in this radical teaching pedagogy?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While flipped classrooms are possible without the use of digital content, we want to leverage on the ability to “create once, used a million times”. Create a good content that follows your own curriculum and many teachers can leverage of the digital resource; freeing up their classroom time for other forms of teacher-student engagements.</p>

<p>Some of the key benefits includes Scalability &amp; Flexibility. Your content and your teaching can reach many more students on-demand. It can be repeated if students needs to revisit the explanation. It can be streamed and played at their own time outside of class when they feel most productive. There is flexibility in the pace students can now take to learn. There is scalability on these contents being reused.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#3. Benefits of Flipped classroom</h2>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Students can now learn at their own pace as videos can be watched again</li>
</ol>

<p>The lecture contents, in forms of manageable length videos, can be provided for outside of classrooms. We allow the traditional passive learning to take place outside of the classroom. This will free up time to have more meaningful engagement with the students - clarifying learning points, additional learning objectives can be accomplished through active learning.</p>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>its more efficient, as students are more prepared to contribute in the classroom</li>
</ol>

<p>As students are more prepared for classrooms, so are their accountability for learning. Students are charged to come for class prepared. Thus their own responsibility and accountability for their own learning is increased.</p>
<br>
<ol start="3">
<li>It enriches the classroom as more time can be spent on group work and projects</li>
</ol>

<p>When the traditional learning takes place outside of classroom time, the classroom now has the potential to turn into a workshop that incorporates and focuses on active hands on learning. With flipped classroom, active learning approach becomes the core component rather than a supplementary to the lectures.</p>
<br>
<ol start="4">
<li>Doing homework in class allows students to help each other. Helping the advance and less advance learners</li>
</ol>

<p>As the class becomes more interactive and bi-directional, suddenly we find space for students to step up. As students are now charged to help their weaker students, the classroom can starts to function like a family -  or even a small society. Each with a common goal, but having different interactions and forms to teach different needs; Each students now play a responsibility of adding onto the educational experience of their peers. It feels safe, and it feels like the ideal we would like to impart</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>The classroom can serve as an example of what the world should look like—all&nbsp;students with equal power, regardless of their culture or background—rather than a replication of what it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<ol start="5">
<li>Flipped classroom allows teachers to target students who really needs help instead of those who are just confident</li>
</ol>
<br>
<ol start="6">
<li>Flipped classroom allows teachers to guide by the side instead of teaching at the front.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<ol start="7">
<li>Teachers who are not good presenters can use third-party videos to explain concepts and focus on teaching styles that best suit them such as project work or experiments. Once presented and recorded, teachers don’t have to teach the concept over and over again. They gain more time to focus on the needs of the class.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<ol start="8">
<li>It promotes equal learning opportunities as all kids get the same attention when doing their homework; either through the teacher or their more advanced classmates.</li>
</ol>

<p>This includes the support for diversity in student learning styles. For example, in addition to lecture students may reflect on materials through questions and discussions with the classroom facilitators. If they are more comfortable with their peers, they can also learn by working with their classmates to solve problems, demonstrating and arguing their own solutions to class experiments and work.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#4. How to get started?</h2>

<p>There are many tools out there for one to leverage on. You can also reference my post of the educational tools that are available for us</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Decide what technology you will use</h3>

<p>I’ve also taken the time to curate a list of highly useful technology to facilitate discussions and flipped classroom’s content sharing. It can be the use of videos to do your digital lecture or it could be through the use of games. These are merely tools that allows you to put up your own content based on your own curriculum and syllabus for students. Whichever the tool, find one that is best for your use case; straight forward and easy with lowest barrier to entry.</p>

<p>Check out the <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-07-25-top-10-educational-tools/">Educational tools</a>!</p>
<br>
<h3>2. What video service are you going to use?</h3>

<p>Now once you consider your technology, you have to then decide if you want to utilize a low technology or high technology approach. Low technology could mean simply just a 5mins video of you teaching the content from a particular topic. You can just upload your video on Youtube and then reference that using the video’s URL.</p>

<p>High technology approach will use an application that will capture both your audio and also your computer screen. This allows you to reference visual resources while you walk through the content. You can use powerpoint or basically any form of visuals that will aid your teaching.</p>

<p>Once you have considered this approach and have created your own video. Now you have to figure out which video service do your students have access to? Do you want your videos to be public or private.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the most common choice will <strong>Youtube</strong>. It is highly accessibly across devices, they have friendly UX that even toddlers are able to navigate the application even before they can talk</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Set up your virtual class!</h3>

<p>From the educational tools, one of the effective tool to create your class workflow is “eduflow”. It allows you to create your own segments of your class. First we will watch videos, then we will have a forum to answer a question “what have you learnt about algebra”. Now you can review your peer’s answers and check if they are correct or wrong.</p>

<p>Below is a screen record of my own personal trying of eduflow to create a class curriculum on space exploration!</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>4. Find out more information on educational technology forums</h3>

<p>As the world evolves to embrace technology in the educational space, communities of people coming together to put together great ideas, experiences, and expertises on remote learning and flipped classroom concepts.</p>

<p>Listed below are some of the ed-tech forums with active communal discussions:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/edtechforum?lang=en">Twitter edtechforum</a> is one such platform for teachers to come together to share</li>
<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/edtech/">Reddit edtech</a> <em>There are discussions about the educational space</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a small guide on how to get started on your remote teaching experience for each of your class.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/img/2020-08-01-benefits-challenges-of-flipped-classroom/1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Here’s also an interesting Youtube video on how to get started on flipped learning as well:</p>

<p>

<br>
<h2>#4. Challenges of Flipped classroom</h2>

<p>Not all implementations come without its challenges. As we are showered with the benefits of flipped classroom and the amount of classroom time freed up from rogue learning and transformed into interactive discussion and application of concepts, there are still challenges that may create inertia or even stiffen teacher’s adoption of flipped classroom.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>No, you’re not the only one facing these problems</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3>1. Faculty buy-in</h3>

<p>Since facilitators are the ones to persuade or require students to watch the online videos or complete class readings before the class. If the faculty members are not onboard to share and work upon this expectation on students, theres a good chance that students will not come prepared.</p>

<p>As …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>Anyone else tired of these annoying popups?</p>

<p><img src="https://lovettchris.github.io/posts/apple_upsell/icloud_installer.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m getting pretty tired of all this… I actually tried to find customer support for the PC
installer popup, but no luck. Anyone know who owns this ugly little Windows app? I find it
particularly devious that Apple uses language here that sounds like something is broken until I
“Install” their fix. This is not a fix, this is an upsell to get iCloud on my PC.</p>

<p>The iPhone backup message is also annoying. I tried to tell my iPhone to stop backing up my photos,
and yet I still get this backup failed warning every day. Perhaps Apple should find a more creative
way to upsell my on iCloud because this is driving me nuts, and making it much less likely I’ll
ever checkout the benefits of paying Apple for cloud storage on stuff I’ve backed up my self lots
of other ways.</p>

<p>Apple is world class on user experiences of everything else, so why are they so bad at this
experience? I’m guessing the part of the company that expertly squeezes every dime out of consumers
is not so connected to the user experience gods at Apple… Here’s hoping I can wake up some of
those gods to go slap the accountants on the wrist for this naughty behavior.</p>

July 31, 2020 | https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/hacking-pleroma/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/hacking-pleroma/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" itemprop="articleBody">
				<p><a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> "is a microblogging server software that can federate (= exchange messages with) other servers that support the same federation standards (OStatus and ActivityPub). What that means is that you can host a server for yourself or your friends and stay in control of your online identity, but still exchange messages with people on larger servers. Pleroma will federate with all servers that implement either OStatus or ActivityPub, like GNU Social, Friendica, Hubzilla and Mastodon." <a href="https://blog.soykaf.com/post/what-is-pleroma/">(stolen from Lain's blog post)</a>.</p>

<p>Recently I modified my Pleroma instance to support bot services: parse a posted message, take an action, post the result. To get there I had to learn <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>, the language in which Pleroma is written, as well as <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html">Phoenix</a>, the web framework Elixir uses, and a little bit about ActivityPub, the protocol for exchanging messages. What I want to explain here in particular is the architecture of Pleroma, so that you can hack it more easily, for fun or if you want to participate in the development.</p>

<h2>Elixir</h2>

<p>As Pleroma is written in <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> you'll need to learn that language to some extent. If you are familiar with Ruby (or Perl, for that matter) and with the idea of functional programming (everything is a function), then it is quite easy to learn and understand. The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/">documentation</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">guides</a> are very good. </p>

<p>If you've never hear of functional programming, the main difference with e.g. Ruby or Java is that Elixir does not use an object-oriented programming model. Instead, there are functions that manipulate data structures and other functions. A particular consequence of the functional model is that there are no for- or while-loops. Instead, there are what is called higher-order functions which e.g. apply another function to a list. Elixir programs also make a lot more use of recursion. </p>

<p>Another point about Elixir as a web programming language is that it is built on a system where processes communicate by passing messages to one another, and it is  built in such a way that if a process dies it will normally be restarted automatically. This approach makes it very easy to offload work to separate worker processes etc. </p>

<p>All this comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, the language on which Elixir is built, with its powerfull OTP framework for building applications and its BEAM virtual machine, which manages the processes. </p>

<h2>Phoenix</h2>

<p>A lot of the groundwork of Pleroma is done by <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html">Phoenix</a>, a very easy-to-use web server framework. Essentially, what happens is that the end user accesses the application using a specific url, typically via a web browser, and based on this url the application performs a number of actions, which in the end result in a change in the state of the application and usually in what is shown in the browser window.</p>

<p>In Phoenix, there are five stages or components  between the connection and the resulting action by the application:</p>

<h3>Endpoint</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Endpoint.html">endpoint</a> is the boundary where all requests to your web application start. It is also the interface your application provides to the underlying web servers.</p>

<p>Pleroma's endpoint is <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/endpoint.ex"><code>web/endpoint.ex</code></a>. If you look at the source you see several occurrences of <code>plug(Plug...)</code>. <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/plug.html">Plug</a> is a specification for composable modules in between web applications, and it is very heavily used in Pleroma.  For example, to serve only specific static files/folders from <code>priv/static</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>plug</span><span>(</span>
  <span>Plug.Static</span><span>,</span>
  <span>at</span><span>:</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>:pleroma</span><span>,</span>
  <span>only</span><span>:</span> <span>~w(index.html static finmoji emoji packs sounds images instance sw.js)</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Another very nice feature of Phoenis is that you can edit your code while your server is running. It gets automatically recompiled and the affected processes are automatically restarted, courtesy of the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.CodeReloader.html">Phoenix.CodeReloader</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span>  <span># Code reloading can be explicitly enabled under the</span>
  <span># :code_reloader configuration of your endpoint.</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>code_reloading?</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>Phoenix.CodeReloader</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Router</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Router.html">Routers</a> are the main hubs of Phoenix applications. They match HTTP requests to controller actions, wire up real-time channel handlers, and define a series of pipeline transformations for scoping middleware to sets of routes.</p>

<p>Pleroma's router is <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/router.ex"><code>web/router.ex</code></a>. The key function in the router is the <code>pipeline</code> which lets you create pipelines of plugs. Other functions are <code>scope</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>post</code>, <code>pipe_through</code>, all of these let you match on the url and whether you are dealing with a get or post request, and define appropriate pipelines of actions. For example, federated ActivityPub requests handled as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>scope</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>Pleroma.Web.ActivityPub</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>pipe_through</span><span>(</span><span>:activitypub</span><span>)</span>
  <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>"/users/:nickname/inbox"</span><span>,</span> <span>ActivityPubController</span><span>,</span> <span>:inbox</span><span>)</span>
  <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>"/inbox"</span><span>,</span> <span>ActivityPubController</span><span>,</span> <span>:inbox</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>where the <code>pipe_through(:activitypub)</code> call is used to insert a custom pipeline:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>pipeline</span> <span>:activitypub</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>:accepts</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>"activity+json"</span><span>])</span>
  <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Plugs.HTTPSignaturePlug</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Controllers</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Controller.htm">Controllers</a> are used to group common functionality in the same (pluggable) module.  </p>

<p>Pleroma makes heavy use of controllers: almost every request is handled by a specific controller for any given protocol, e.g. <code>MastodonAPIController</code> or <code>ActivityPubController</code>. This makes it easy to identify the files to work on if you need to make a change to the code for a given protocol. For example, the ActivityPub post requests in the Router are handled by <code>inbox</code> function in the <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex">ActivityPubController</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>inbox</span><span>(%{</span><span>assigns</span><span>:</span> <span>%{</span><span>valid_signature</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}}</span> <span>=</span> <span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Federator</span><span>.</span><span>enqueue</span><span>(</span><span>:incoming_ap_doc</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span>
  <span>json</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>"ok"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Views</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.View.html">Views</a> are used to control the rendering of templates. You create a view module, a template and a set of assigns, which are basically key-value pairs.</p>

<p>Pleroma uses views for "rendering" JSON objects. For example in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex"><code>web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex</code></a> there are lines like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>UserView</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>"user.json"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>user</span><span>}))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, <code>UserView.render</code> is defined in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/views/user_view.ex"><code>web/activity_pub/views/user_view.ex</code></a> for a number of different "*.json" strings. These are not really templates, they are simply used to pattern match on the function definitions.</p>

<p>The more conventional usage to create HTML is also used, e.g. the template <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/templates/mastodon_api/mastodon/index.html.eex"><code>web/templates/mastodon_api/mastodon/index.html.eex</code></a>
is used in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/mastodon_api/mastodon_api_controller.ex"><code>web/mastodon_api/mastodon_api_controller.ex</code></a> via the view
<a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/mastodon_api/views/mastodon_view.ex"><code>web/mastodon_api/views/mastodon_view.ex</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>MastodonView</span><span>,</span> <span>"index.html"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>initial_state</span><span>:</span> <span>initial_state</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Templates</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Template.html">Templates</a> are text files (typically html pages) with Elixir code to generate the specific values based on the assigns, included in <code>&lt;%= ... %&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in Pleroma, the Mastodon front-end uses a template for the <code>index.html</code> file which has the code</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>%</span><span>=</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>get_env</span><span>(</span><span>:pleroma</span><span>,</span> <span>:instance</span><span>)[</span><span>:name</span><span>]</span> <span>%</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>to show the name of the instance.</p>

<h2>Ecto</h2>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html">Ecto</a> is not a part of Phoenix, but it is an integral part of most web applications: Ecto is Elixir's main library for working with databases. It provides the tools to interact with databases under a common API.</p>

<p>Ecto is split into 4 main components:</p>

<p>Ecto.Repo - repositories are wrappers around the data store. Via the repository, we can create, update, destroy and query existing entries. A repository needs an adapter and credentials to communicate to the database</p>

<p>Pleroma uses the PostgresQL database.</p>

<p>Ecto.Schema - schemas are used mainly to map tables into Elixir data (there are other use cases too).</p>

<p>Ecto.Changeset - changesets provide a way for developers to filter and cast external parameters, as well as a mechanism to track and validate changes before they are applied to your data</p>

<p>Ecto.Query - written in Elixir syntax, queries are used to retrieve information from the database.</p>

<h2>GenServer</h2>

<p>Because Elixir, like Erlang, uses a processes-with-message-passing paradigm, client-server relationships are so common that they have been abstracted as a <em>behaviour</em>, which in Elixir is a specification for composable modules which have to implement specified public functions (a bit like an interface in Java or typeclass in Haskell).</p>

<p>If we look at the <code>Federator.enqueue</code> function, its implementation actually reduces to a single line:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>cast</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>:enqueue</span><span>,</span> <span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>payload</span><span>,</span> <span>priority</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html">GenServer</a> is an Elixir behaviour module for implementing the server of a client-server relation. The <code>cast</code> call sends an asynchronous request to the server (synchronous requests use <code>call</code>). The server behaviour is implemented using the <code>handle_cast</code> callback, which handles <code>cast</code> calls. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/federator/federator.ex"><code>Pleroma.Federator</code></a>, these are implemented in the same module as the <code>enqueue</code> function, hence the use of <code>__MODULE__</code> rather than the hardcoded module name.</p>

<h2>Applications, Workers and Supervisors</h2>

<p>Elixir borrows the concept of a "supervision tree" from Erlang/OTP. AN application consists of a tree of processes than can either be <em>supervisors</em> or <em>workers</em>. The task of a supervisors is to ensure that the worker processes do their work, including distributing the work and restarting the worker processes when they die. Supervisors can supervise either worker or other supervisors, so you can build a <em>supervision tree</em>.</p>

<p>Elixir provides an <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Application.html">Application</a> behaviour module and a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html">Supervisor</a> module to make this easy. The Application module requires a <code>start()</code> function as entry point. Typical code to create a supervision tree is</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>Supervisor</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>children</span><span>,</span> <span>opts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>where <code>start_link()</code> spawns the top process of the tree, and it spawns all the child processes in the list <code>children</code>. </p>

<p>Pleroma uses a convenient but deprecated module called <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.Spec.html">Supervisor.Spec</a> which provides <code>worker()</code> and <code>supervisor()</code> functions, for example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>children</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>supervisor</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Repo</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span>supervisor</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Endpoint</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span># ...</span>
  <span>worker</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Federator</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span># ...</span>
<span>]</span>  
</code></pre></div>
<p>Every worker has this own <code>start_link</code> function,  e.g.  in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/federator/federator.ex"><code>web/federator/federator.ex</code></a> we find: </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>start_link</span> <span>do</span>
  <span># ...</span>
  <span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This means that the Federator module borrows the <code>start_link</code> from the GenServer module. This is a very common way to create a worker.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty" target="_blank">Alacritty</a>
      is a terminal emulator with a strong focus on simplicity and performance.
      With such a strong focus on performance, included features are carefully
      considered and you can always expect Alacritty to be blazingly fast. By
      making sane choices for defaults, Alacritty requires no additional setup.
      However, it does allow configuration of many aspects of the terminal.

July 31, 2020 | https://xtrp.io/blog/2020/07/31/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://xtrp.io/blog/2020/07/31/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Title assumes 265 words per minute reading time, as used by Medium and others.</em></p>
<p>Discord bots can be useful in doing a variety of things like playing music in a voice chat, or sending automated announcements when a Youtuber releases a new video.</p>
<p>I'm active on several Discord servers myself and have always wanted to build my own Discord bot. After building, deploying, and using my own bot for over a month now, I've written this article as a starting point in building a basic bot and moving from there.</p>
<p>We'll be building a bot that does something pretty simple: solves math equations. Users will be able to send a message on any channel that looks like <code>!solve [math equation]</code> and receive a response with the calculated result. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/botexamplefunctionality.png" alt="Bot Functionality Graphic"></p>
<h3>Before Reading, You Should:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Know basic JavaScript and Node.js (with Node and NPM installed)</li>
<li>Have a Discord account (create one <a href="https://discord.com/">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Create a Discord API Application and Bot</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">discord.com/developers/applications</a> and click 'New Application' on the top right. Let's call the app 'Solver Bot'.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/newapp.png" alt="New Application Button Screenshot"></p>
<p>By creating an app, you'll be able to get a unique API key to connect to the Discord API, create a bot, and do things like send and receive messages with that bot.</p>
<p>Now click on the 'Bot' tab on the right sidebar and click 'Add Bot'.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/addbot.png" alt="Bot Tab and Add Bot Screenshot"></p>
<p>Add a profile picture to the bot by importing a file from your local machine.</p>
<p>I'll be using an icon which you can <a href="https://github.com/xtrp/tutorials/blob/master/discord-solver-bot/icon.png">download here</a> (this icon is CC0 Licensed, and you can use it without attribution).</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/boticon.png" alt="Bot Icon and Name Screenshot"></p>
<h2>2. Add Your Bot to a Server!</h2>
<p>Now that we've created a Discord API App with a bot account, we can add the bot to a server. I recommend making your own server to test your bots.</p>
<p>To add a bot to a server, all we need is an Discord OAuth2 URL. Upon opening this URL, any Discord user can add your bot to a server they own, and grant it permissions.</p>
<p>To generate the URL, open up the OAuth2 tab.</p>
<p>You'll see a grid of checkboxes, and here, select the 'bot' option. Another grid should appear, and here is where you'll select bot permissions. For this basic bot, we'll just need to manage and read messages.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/botselection.png" alt="App and Bot Scopes and Permissions Screenshot"></p>
<p>Given these selected options, Discord automatically generates an OAuth2 URL, which you can see in the input box under the first grid. The URL should look something like <code>https://discord.com/oauth2/...</code>.</p>
<p>Try copying and opening the URL! You should be able to add the bot to any servers you own.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/copyoauthurl.png" alt="Discord OAuth2 URL"></p>
<h2>3. Create the Functionality of Your Bot With Node and Discord.js</h2>
<p>Let's start building the functionality of the bot in Node.</p>
<p>Make a new folder (or Git repository if that's what you prefer) on your machine called <code>discord-solver-bot</code>.</p>
<p>On your Terminal or Command Line, navigate to the folder and run <code>npm init</code>, adding any the necessary details when you see fit.</p>
<p>Now, let's add our dependencies. We'll be using <a href="https://discord.js.org/">Discord.js</a>, a package which simplifies connecting and using the Discord API. For solving math equations, we'll use the useful <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/equations">Equations</a> module.</p>
<p>Run <code>npm install discord.js equations --save</code> to install these packages.</p>
<p>Okay, now we can create an <code>index.js</code> file in the folder and start writing some code.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/commandline.png" alt="Command Line Example of Creating a Node Project and Adding Packages"></p>
<p>We can start by importing any necessary packages.</p>
<pre><code>const Discord = require('discord.js');
const Equation = require('equations').default; // .default to fix a problem I encountered while importing without it</code></pre>
<h3>Connect to Your Bot With Your Bot Token and Login to Discord</h3>
<p>To connect to your bot with Discord.js, we initialize Discord.js Client object to connect to the Discord API.</p>
<p>To login with our bot with the client, we need the bot token. Copy the token by going to your app in the developer portal &gt; bot &gt; token &gt; copy.</p>
<p>Now we can login to our bot by calling the Client <code>login</code> function and passing the copied token.</p>
<pre><code>const client = new Discord.Client();
client.login("[your bot token here]");</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Don't share your bot token with anyone else. It can be used to take complete control over your bot.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Check if Your Bot is Logged In</h3>
<p>To check if your bot is logged in and ready to do things on Discord, use the Client <code>ready</code> event:</p>
<pre><code>client.on('ready', async () =&gt; {
  console.log(`Logged in successfully as bot!`);
});</code></pre>
<p>Try running the bot by running <code>node index.js</code>. You should see that your bot is logged in. In Discord, you should also be able to see that the bot is marked as online.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/loggedin.png" alt="Bot Logged In Screenshot"></p>
<h3>Listen for a Message and Respond</h3>
<p>Use the client <code>message</code> event to listen any time a user sends a message anywhere on any server the bot is on. The event comes with a message object which contains the <code>content</code> (text content of the message) property among others.</p>
<p>The object also has a <code>.reply</code> method, for your bot to reply to the message directly to the user that sent it.</p>
<p>Typically a message we're looking for looks like <code>!solve [equation here]</code>.</p>
<p>So, all we have to do is check if the message starts with '!solve ', and then solve the equation written afterwards. We can do this with the JavaScript string <code>.startsWith</code> and <code>.slice</code> functions respectively.</p>
<p>For solving the equation the <code>equations</code> package has a <code>.solve</code> function to solve any given equation. <code>.solve</code> throws an error if the equation is not valid, and we can catch that error to reply saying the equation could not be solved.</p>
<p>Here's what this code looks like:</p>
<pre><code>client.on('message', (msg) =&gt; {
    msg.content = msg.content.trim(); // remove extra whitespace
    const flag = '!solve ';
    if (msg.content.startsWith(flag)) {
        const toSolve = msg.content.slice(flag.length, msg.content.length);
        try {
            const solved = Equation.solve(toSolve);

            msg.reply(`${toSolve} = ${solved}`); // backticks (TLs) are used to embed variables in strings like `${var}`
        } catch (err) {
            msg.reply(`Could not solve the equation '${toSolve}'.`);
        }
    }
});</code></pre>
<h2>4. We're Done! Let's Test the Bot</h2>
<p>After running <code>node index</code>, go to a server with the bot (in my case my bot testing server), and try sending a message like <code>!solve 2 + 2</code>. You should see a response like <code>2 + 2 = 4</code>. You can additionally try more complex equations, and test the error checking with a malformed equation.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/build-and-deploy-a-discord-bot-with-node-and-discordjs-in-5-minutes/bottest.png" alt="Bot Functionality Screenshot"></p>
<p>If you'd like, you can <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738260543479218217&amp;permissions=10240&amp;scope=bot">click here</a> to add <strong>my version</strong> of this bot to your own server(s).</p>
<h2>5. Deploying Your Bot and Next Steps</h2>
<p>Deploying your bot is pretty simple. All you have to do is keep the index file (in this case <code>node index</code>) running whenever you want your bot to be online, typically 24/7. You can choose to run it on an old computer or Raspberry Pi, your own server, or you can choose to deploy on a platform like <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of next steps in building a more complex bot, the <a href="https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome">Discord.js documentation</a> can be really useful in using the Discord API to perform functions on text and voice channels, multiple servers, direct messages, and more.</p>
<p>In sharing your bot, there are many websites dedicated to listing Discord bots, including <a href="https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/">bots.ondiscord.xyz</a>, <a href="https://discord.bots.gg/">discord.bots.gg</a>, and <a href="https://top.gg/">top.gg</a>. Building a website for your bot can be useful in showcasing its features and linking the URL to add the bot to a server. Sharing the bot among servers you own are know the owner of can also be useful.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>By coincidence, right when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cherno</a> announced his game engine series I was just starting to get going on my own engine. I couldn’t wait to finally have a professional opinion on how to make one. With self-taught programming it’s hard to not doubt yourself constantly, wondering if you are doing things right or just think you are.</p>



<p>Recently, he has been posting videos about huge aspects of his engine like physics and entity systems, which were what I really wanted to learn about by making myself, but he ended up using libraries instead of going through the internals! I am not against using libraries, but to use them for the fun stuff? I felt like it defeated the point of making a <em>custom</em> engine series.</p>



<p>There is an argument to be made about saving time, but this was the first C++ project that I was making and the goal from the start was to go through all the major pillars of an engine: input, graphics, physics, entities, and audio. I wanted to learn how those things worked along with C++ and code design in general.</p>



<p>I bet that some other people are interested in the details of how these systems work, and I want to learn how to explain code better, so I am going to try and make some videos going over the internals of these systems. They end up being much simpler than at first glance.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s start with the physics engine…</strong></p>



<p>Physics engines are responsible for figuring out where each object in a scene is over time. Objects can collide with one another, then choose to respond in several ways. It’s a generic problem that the user can configure at several different levels. Do they want a collider? Do they want to respond to collisions? Do they want to simulate dynamics? They could want dynamics, but not gravity. It’s a problem that calls for good planning and robust design.</p>



<p>I looked at how <a href="https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">box2d</a> went about sorting their engines and concluded that the way bullet went about it was solid. I boiled it down to just what was needed, and based my design around that. There are already some <a href="https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-i-an-introduction-to-rigid-body-dynamics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great articles</a> going over the hard math involved, so I am going to focus on the design aspect instead because I haven’t seen anyone do that, and it’s also a real headache.</p>



<p>At the current moment, this physics engine is not fully featured, but in future articles I plan to build it out further. This article will not cover rotation, multiple contact point collisions, or constrained simulation. I think it will work out for the best as it’s easy to get overwhelmed, and I want to ease into those topics. With that out of the way, let’s dive into the different parts of a physics engine.</p>



<p>The problem can be split into 2 or 3 pieces, dynamics, collision detection, and collision response. I’ll start with dynamics because it is by far the simplest.</p>



<p><strong>Dynamics</strong></p>



<p>Dynamics is all about calculating where the new positions of objects are based on their velocity and acceleration. In high school you learn about the four kinematic equations along with Newton's three laws which describe the motion of objects. We’ll only be using the first and third kinematic equations, the others are more useful for analysis of situations, not simulation. That leaves us with:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+at</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">\Delta x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2</span></p><p>We can give ourselves more control by using Newtons 2<sup>nd</sup> law, subbing out acceleration giving us:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+\frac{F}{m}t</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">x = x_0+vt</span></p><p>Each object needs to store these three properties: velocity, mass, and net force. Here we find the first decision we can make towards the design, net force could either be a list or a single vector. In school you make force diagrams and sum up the forces, implying that we should store a list. This would make it so you could set a force, but you would need to remove it later which could get annoying for the user. If we think about it further, net force is really the total force applied in a <em>single</em> frame, so we can use a vector and clear it at the end of each update. This allows the user to apply a force by adding it, but removing it is automatic. This shortens our code and gives a performance bump because there is no summation of forces, it’s a running total.</p>



<p>We’ll use this struct to store the object info for now.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Object</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Position</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;struct&nbsp;with&nbsp;3&nbsp;floats&nbsp;for&nbsp;x,&nbsp;y,&nbsp;z&nbsp;or&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;j&nbsp;+&nbsp;k</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Velocity</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Force</span><span>;</span>
	<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>Mass</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>We need a way to keep track of the objects we want to update. A classic approach is to have a <em>physics world</em> that has list of objects and a <em>step</em> function that loops over each one. Let’s see how that might look; I’ll omit header/cpp files for brevity.</p>



<pre><span>class</span>&nbsp;<span>PhysicsWorld</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
<span>private</span><span>:</span>
	<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Object</span><span>*&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span>m_objects</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>m_gravity</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>vector3</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>-</span><span>9.81f</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>);</span>
 
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>AddObject</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>object</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>/*&nbsp;...&nbsp;*/</span>&nbsp;<span>}</span>
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>RemoveObject</span><span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>object</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>/*&nbsp;...&nbsp;*/</span>&nbsp;<span>}</span>
 
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>Step</span><span>(</span>
		<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>)</span>
	<span>{</span>
		<span>for</span>&nbsp;<span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span>&nbsp;<span>:</span>&nbsp;<span>m_objects</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Mass</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>m_gravity</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;apply&nbsp;a&nbsp;force</span>
 
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Velocity</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>/</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Mass</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>;</span>
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Position</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Velocity</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>;</span>
 
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>vector3</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>);</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;reset&nbsp;net&nbsp;force&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;end</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Note the use of pointers, this forces other systems to take care of the actual storing of objects, leaving the physics engine to worry about physics, not memory allocation.</p>



<p>With this you can simulate all sorts of stuff from objects flying through the sky to solar systems.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sHZEs-oQTI4?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>You can do a lot with this, but it’s the easy part to be honest, and that’s not what you came for…</p>



<p><strong>Collision detection</strong></p>



<p>Collision detection is more involved, but we can lighten the load by using some clever tricks. Let’s think about what needs to be found first. If we look at some examples of objects colliding, we notice that in most cases there is a point on each shape that is furthest inside the other.</p>

<p>This turns out to be all we need to respond to a collision. From those two points we can find the normal, and how deep the objects are inside one another. This is huge because it means that we can abstract the idea of different shapes away, and only worry about the points in the response.</p>



<p>Let’s jump into the code, we’ll need some helper structs that I’ll note first.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>A</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;A&nbsp;into&nbsp;B</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>B</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;into&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Normal</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A&nbsp;normalized</span>
	<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>Depth</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Length&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>bool</span>&nbsp;<span>HasCollision</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
 
<span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Describes&nbsp;an&nbsp;objects&nbsp;location</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Position</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Scale</span><span>;</span>
	<span>quaternion</span>&nbsp;<span>Rotation</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Each shape will have a different type of collider to hold its properties and a base to allow them to be stored. Any type of collider should be able to test for a collision with any other type, so we’ll add functions in the base for each one. These functions will take <em>Transforms</em>, so the colliders can use relative coordinates. I’ll only demonstrate spheres and planes, but the code is repeatable for any number of colliders.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>collider</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>colliderTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
 
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>SphereCollider</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>sphere</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>sphereTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
 
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>PlaneCollider</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>plane</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>planeTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Let’s make both types of colliders at the same time too see how they interact. A sphere is defined as a point and a radius, and a plane is defined as a vector and a distance. We’ll override the functions from <em>Collider</em>, but won’t worry about the work for now.</p>



<p>We can choose per collider which other colliders it will detect by filling, or not filling, in these functions. In this case, we don’t want Plane v Plane collisions, so we return an empty <em>CollisionPoints</em>.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>SphereCollider</span>
	<span>:</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Center</span><span>;</span>

			<span>this</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>sphere</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>sphereTransform</span><span>);</span>
	<span>}</span>

	<span>}</span>
<span>};</span></pre>



<p>We can add a function for testing the base and use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double dispatch</a>. This takes advantage of the type system to determine both types of colliders for us by swapping the arguments, determining the first, then the second type through two calls of TestCollision. This saves us needing to know what type of colliders we are checking, which means we’ve fully abstracted away the notion of different shapes outside the collision detection.</p>

<p>Over the past century, the labor market in America has seen a dramatic shift from blue-collar to white-collar work. According to the Bureau of Census Data, white-collar work in the US grew from 17.6% of total employment in 1900 to 59.9% in 2003 [1]. The “white-collar” categorization was then discontinued for lack of specificity, but the fact remains that the majority of the American workforce is now employed in work where brainpower is more relevant than muscle power, a situation opposite to the way things were a century ago.</p>



<p>As knowledge work was displacing manual labor as the most common form of employment in America, the amount of formal education completed by Americans also grew rapidly. Before World War 2, only a quarter of American adults had graduated high school, and a vanishingly small percent had gone to college. Americans like George Washington, Cornelius Vanderbilt and Thomas Edison rose to the heights of politics, business and science with little to no formal education. But that state of affairs changed quickly after the end of World War 2 with the introduction of the GI bill, which paid for postsecondary education for millions of veterans. 75 years later, a large majority of American adults now hold high school degrees, and over a third hold bachelor’s degrees.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LtNpx8ZHyaIn1-_Wu6ns-jOZTpztV-j1gWgCKcjTOQ-AIGQrv9Uhi97QiNop4AnqVYlwvvIaUjiTd45BtDbJP5RKm1dUMs522WYQIOf6raUZt15cQv9E_ftsck5bPJ8mSCh-awCF" alt=""></figure>







<p>As Americans have begun to attain higher levels of formal educational credentials, so too have jobs begun to demand higher levels of credentials as a prerequisite. Some of this is because some jobs really do require extensive formal education: patients might not want to be operated on by a neurosurgeon who had learned exclusively on-the-job! But many white-collar jobs, like sales and clerical roles, which do not require extensive theoretical training and traditionally were not filled by college graduates, are starting to require higher degrees in a phenomenon often referred to as degree inflation [2].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of this is rational from the point of view of the employer, as college graduates can be expected to have higher levels of skills applicable to office work than high school graduates or dropouts, if only due to their four extra years of experience performing a type of knowledge work in college. But spending four years writing papers on art history with the goal of landing a sales job is not efficient from the point of view of either the prospective employer, who limits their labor pool and ends up paying a premium for entry-level labor, or the prospective employee, who incurs often-heavy tuition fees and four years of opportunity cost before starting a career.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A better model exists in the form of apprenticeships. For centuries, teenagers have learned skilled blue-collar trades in collaboration with more experienced mentors, and have emerged into young adulthood as full-fledged professionals in their chosen field. As an added benefit, apprentices can be productive in the lower-skilled parts of a job almost from the get-go, implicitly paying for their own training and earning a wage as their counterparts in college instead pay tuition.</p>



<p>This model has occasionally been applied to white-collar professions in countries like Germany and the UK, in which formal apprenticeships in the traditional mold exist for higher-skilled jobs like IT system administration and CNC machining. Those programs, where they exist, are generally coordinated to some degree by the relevant government, but America’s culture would likely pair better with a privatized apprenticeship model, which could fill niches unseen by a government administrator.</p>



<p>In such a model, companies large enough to sustain internal apprenticeship programs would designate appropriate roles for which they would hire apprentices, like sales or web development. For those roles, they would hire recent high school graduates or even dropouts, who would commit to the apprenticeship program for several years.</p>



<p>The apprentices would be assigned to a team and mentor, just like a typical intern or co-op student worker, with the key difference being that they would stay on each team for one to several years, rotating as appropriate to learn different aspects of their chosen profession.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This on-the-job training would be paired with classroom training, where each cohort of apprentices would be instructed in relevant skills alongside their day job. This might include things like written and oral communication for sales apprentices, psychology and anthropology for marketers, and computer science and graphic design for web developers. Some of these courses could be conducted internally by the company’s more-senior employees; others could be outsourced to local colleges in a reverse co-op arrangement.</p>



<p>The expectation would be that after completion of the apprenticeship program, some of its alumni would keep working in their new profession, while others would then go to college to pursue a broader and deeper formal education. Those that kept working would have the advantage of a four-year head start in their career trajectory and a much better financial situation than a recent college graduate; those that went to college after all would have a very compelling college admissions packet, transfer credits to the extent their employer could negotiate for them with universities, and a much better idea of what is worth studying in college than someone right out of high school. Talented students from poor families and poor schools might benefit to an especial degree from this sort of program, which would let them gain a stable financial footing and a better understanding than that provided by their high school of how to navigate a future college education. In this way, an apprenticeship program would play a similar role to that which the military plays for many teenagers today, but would prepare them for a rather different sort of work.</p>



<p>Of course, some apprentices would probably flounder partway through the program, or conversely be tempted to leave for a competitor. Employers could protect their investment by a similar mechanism to what West Point does for cadets: apprentices could leave at any point during the first year with no strings attached, but those that left later on would have to pay back the expenses incurred in training them. The apprenticeship program could also have a contractual requirement to work for the employer for a certain number of years after completing the program, with the alternative option of paying a financial penalty. Employers could also protect their investments in their apprentices by paying the college tuition of apprenticeship alumni who wished to go to college afterwards, under the condition that they return for a certain number of years after completing their degrees – much like many employers pay for business school for their employees under the condition that they come back afterwards.</p>



<p>This system of white-collar apprenticeships would have significant advantages for both the employer and the apprentice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The employer would be able to attract some of the most talented and driven teenagers with a unique value proposition and thereby gain a recruiting advantage over competitors that wait to hire much competed-over college graduates. The apprentices, once recruited, would also have the value of being able to perform necessary but less-skilled work that must currently be done by older employees for whom it is tremendously boring. Once done with their contractual term, a number of apprentices could be expected to stick around and keep working for the employer and delivering value for years to come, assuming the employer did a good enough job to keep offering opportunities for advancement and a good work culture.</p>



<p>For high school students, the apprenticeship program would represent a unique opportunity to&nbsp;learn a profession with great career opportunities while earning a living straight out of high school, while keeping options open for a college education and even improving them. Right now, many high school graduates go off to college to study things which they will never use again, and make friends there with people who all too often end up moving to different cities and drifting apart over time. Instead, a well-run apprenticeship program would let students learn a gainful profession and the theoretical knowledge behind it while earning money from day one, and to use some of the most social years of their lives to form bonds with friends who would be far more likely to stay in the same industry and city and remain close social and professional contacts for decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting a program like this would surely lead to howls of disapproval from those who see the one-size-fits-all track of formal education as the right way for everyone, but the company that started it would be more than compensated for that negative attention by the newfound stream of talent it would be able to access. Done right, an apprenticeship program would prove its worth in a matter of years, and would surely spawn numerous competitors – exactly what our economy needs in this era of degree inflation.</p>



<p>The only question is, which company will seize the opportunity to go first? [3]</p>

Maybe my former employer will be the one to blaze this trail.</p>

      <p><em>The next big area of concern is the economy. I actually studied economics in college, and I'll be the first to tell you that most of it is over-wrought academic mumbo-jumbo. What ultimately matters is that the job-money-rent-food cycle continues "working" for most* citizens. Very serious threats like hyperinflation / devaluation of currency, or mass defaults of households and businesses are now on the horizon. When James Carville said "it's the economy, stupid", he was referring to this; if most* people cannot sustain their livelihoods through the economic system, and order cannot be kept through the judicial / military system, that's when the zombie apocalypse starts. Nobody wants the zombie apocalypse to start.</em></p>
      <p>Well, it's been about a full month. I am unhappy to report that the zombie apocalypse unfortunately seems closer than ever. Alex Jones is probably wondering what seasoning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfZcKCIcug8">goes best on his neighbors</a>.</p>
      <p>I'm joking, of course. Kind of. Here's a brief recap of our economic situation, as of July 31:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Only ~43% of Americans have some kind of job<ul>
      <li>~18 million Americans remain officially unemployed (U3)</li>
      <li>Another 100 million Americans are categorized as Not In Labor Force</li>
      <li>Another 71 million Americans are not "Officially Employed"</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Among those 43%, it is unclear how much income they're actually making. You are counted as "Officially Employed" if you:<ul>
      <li>Work 1 hour / week</li>
      <li>Are temporarily absent from your job, whether or not you are paid for time off</li>
      <li>Worked a minimum of 15 hours without pay for your family's business</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>According to some surveys, as many as 69% (nice) of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings. (And those are 2019 numbers; it seems safe to assume the % is substantially higher in July 2020)</li>
      <li>The Paycheck Protection Program (extra money for workers) ended on June 30, and the CARES act (additional unemployment benefits) will end today. It seems overwhelmingly likely that additional major stimulus will have to be passed to keep Americans afloat.</li>
      <li>In <strong>April</strong>, the CBO projected the year-total US deficit for 2020 will be <strong>$3.7 trillion dollars</strong> (larger than the entire US debt in 1991) -- <em>before</em> we pass any new stimulus.</li>
      <li>GDP shrank ~10% in the first half of 2020 (from $21.43 trillion in 2019, to an annualized $19.41 trillion now), and although it's expected to bounce back substantially, everything is up in the air due to coronavirus uncertainty.</li>
      <li>Current US debt, before any new stimulus gets passed, is $26.48 trillion.</li>
      <li>This puts us at <strong>136% debt-to-GDP</strong> (123.6%, if you want to be super fair and use 2019 numbers). This is highest in American history, well surpassing the WWII peak at ~122%</li>
      <li>According to <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/06/how-much-is-the-national-debt-what-are-the-different-measures-used#:~:text=The%20United%20States'%20debt%2Dto,is%20the%20highest%20since%201948.">pgpf.org</a>, a whopping 39% of current US debt is held by foreign creditors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Everyone seems pretty fine with additional major stimulus (me included). But why should we care about the debt?</p>
      <p>A very common refrain from many pundits, especially post-2008, is that public debt just doesn't matter anymore. The fed can print* as much money as it wants, and as long as there's no detectable inflation, we shouldn't run into any issues. There's a pseudointellectual theory of economics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory">Modern Monetary Theory</a> which makes a garbled academic case for this point, and there's been a lot of handwringing about it. To save you the trouble; the whole thing is hot philosophical garbage.</p>
      <p>I actually think there's value in it, though, from an absurdist, <em>Modest Proposal</em>-esque troll on the establishment of fiscal politics. As stated in my <em>civics</em> series, the 2008 bailouts basically shattered any sense of justice or reason that legitimized our economic system. If we can just print* trillions of dollars to save big banks and corporations, why can't we just print* trillions of more dollars to fix healthcare, education, and alleviate economic inequality?</p>
      <p>The 20th century macroeconomic models fail us here. While the classical views on macro were mostly debunked by 1973, it really took until 2008 for the entire system to stop making sense completely. And by 2020, we're fully swimming in the theater of the absurd, as this domain of financial sophistry comes head-to-head with the real livelihoods and raw survival decisions of millions of American families.</p>
      <p>I still think there's hope for us to make it through; avoiding a dark age, civil war, zombie apocalypse, military dictatorship, or some other kind of terrible calamity. Mostly, we just need to agree about basic facts and ideas about how the economy works, and then collectively reckon with how out-of-sync our financial system is with the material needs (and wants) of US citizens. Then, we need to elect leaders and agree on policy proposals that both clearly outline a shared future vision for the American economy, and then take whatever necessary steps to get us there safely. All while unifying around rising foreign adversaries that want to divide us, like Russia and China, and -- preferably -- taking meaningful steps to actually address centuries-long racial and economic disparities that have plagued the American populace since its inception.</p>
      <p>Should be easy, right? ðŸ˜…</p>
      <p>I offer nothing in the way of specific answers, platforms, or policy proposals; I am not an economist, historian, or policy guy, and I'm not technically an academic of any kind. I formed most of my perspective on the economy from watching documentaries like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_TjBNjc9Bo"><em>I.O.U.S.A.</em></a><em>,</em> movies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GfqispPMes"><em>The Big Short</em></a>, and reading books like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ascent-Money-Financial-History-World/dp/0143116177"><em>The Ascent of Money</em></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Turbulence-Adventures-New-World/dp/0143114166"><em>The Age of Turbulence</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/103996/when-genius-failed-by-roger-lowenstein/"><em>When Genius Failed</em></a>. I disliked most of my own college curriculum (I did study economics for a year or two, before switching to computer science, before dropping out). So take all of this with a grain of salt, and cross-reference my claims with people who actually know wtf they're talking about.</p>
      <p><strong>If you feel like you're totally and completely lost on the subject of economics</strong>, and you've been persuaded to <a href="https://cjohnson.io/civics">take civics seriously</a>, I highly recommend jumping into the history and contemporary debates about it. Trust me; the water is fine. I think a lot of young people lack the confidence to understand or participate in this discussion, because they think it sounds complicated, involves a lot of complex math, or is probably best left to "experts". While it might not be for everyone, I assure you that these concepts are truly not that hard to understand. You don't need any math beyond basic arithmetic, and there are many accessible entry points into the history and politics stuff (the aforementioned I.O.U.S.A. documentary is a great place to start; there's even an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/the-ascent-of-money-part-1-from-bullion-to-bubbles/"><em>Ascent of Money</em> TV show</a>). If anything we discuss doesn't make sense initially, just go slow and Google things.</p>
      <p>The outline of this essay series is simple. I only keep track of two metrics regarding the US financial system: the <strong>debt-to-GDP ratio</strong> and the <strong>PPP / exchange rates</strong> of the US dollar. To break this down further, we'll look at three topics in total, split into three different essays:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Not all debt is created equal</li>
      <li>Not all GDP is created equal</li>
      <li>The power of the USD</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This first essay is about debt.</p>
      <p>===</p>
      <p><strong>Debt</strong></p>
      <p>Everyone understands the basic idea of debt; you borrow money from someone, and you incur a financial obligation to pay them back eventually. That's the most we can say about it definitively. Debt is a truly fascinating subject; there are multitudes of different theories about it, types of it, and personal experiences with it. I can't hope to do the concept itself justice, but I'll certainly offer an abridged take. The way I frame it is like this:</p>
      <p>Debt is a financial relationship (between humans, business entities, governments), which is mediated by both other types of relationships (personal, familial, commercial, civic) and is enforced by specific systems (the legal system, international agreements, physical force). The nature of this relationship is inherently contextual; the interpretation of what a debt <em>means</em> depends highly on the specific parties involved, the surrounding cultural / legal environment, and even the global background setting of world affairs. Debt itself is mostly neutral; it can be used positively, it can be used harmfully, it can be used for growth, and it can be used for control.</p>
      <p>A useful way to break down different types of debt is to examine expectations around repayment, interest, and consequences for defaulting. Let's look at some toy examples, just to get a feel for the different varieties here:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>You owe thousands of dollars to a 1920s mafia gangster (maybe you took on a gambling debt, or you owe money for "protection"). You better have his money by next Thursday, or "it'd be a shame if somethin' happened to ya'" (he's going to break your legs, burn down your business, hurt your family, etc.)</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Your dad loans you $3000 to buy a used car upon graduating high school. Most dads probably don't care when you pay it back, or even if you ever do. Maybe, if he's a jerk, he'll tease you about it often at family gatherings.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>You recently lost one of your three jobs. To buy food / diapers for your kids, pay rent, and cover your costs for the next month, you take out a payday loan at 350% APR. If you're very lucky, a family member / local church organization chips in to pay it back quickly. In the dismally common case, you just can't pay it back for a while, so your principal balloons to unpayable proportions. You just live in a debt trap; your credit score tumbles, monthly payments rise, and your assets / wages are at risk of …</p></li></ul></div></div>

    <p>2020 has flipped the investment scene upside down: retail investors are now in charge. It first struck me when i picked the <a href="https://shyal.com/blog/tesla-stock-bottom-date">tesla stock bottom date</a> while professional financial advisors, professional investors, and economics professors missed the entire 800% move.</p>
<h2 id="millenials-hold-the-reins">Millenials hold the reins</h2>
<p>Don't want to take my word for it? Then in the words of billionaire investor Chamath Paliphpitiya:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Retail investors now have access to so much information that it's almost on parity with people that work in traditional investment organisations" -- Chamath Palihapitiya</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 48.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2048.png"></p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-retail-flows">The importance of retail flows</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.biancoresearch.com/about-us/">Jim Bianco</a>, a macro strategist who recently featured on <a href="https://realvision.com/">RealVision</a> also agrees: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well, that seems to be what's going on with a lot of this money, even though a traditional AAII account might have half a million dollars in it, and a Robinhood account might have 10,000 just to use a number, that 10,000 will turn over every day or two, that half a million might do three trades a year. That Robinhood account will have a bigger influence on the flow of money in and out of the markets than those other accounts. Citadel says that about 25% of all trading in the markets, they said this to Bloomberg a few weeks ago, is retail investors on peak days, 20% on normal days. Now the third group" -- Jim Bianco @ RealVision</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>on peak days, people trading on their apps are actually driving the price action.</li>
<li>the rest of the time (non peak days) they still dictate about a third of the price action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The average Robinhood investor is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/robinhood-profiles-morgan-stanley-etrade">30 years old</a>. </p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 51.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2051.png"></p>
<h2 id="listen-to-the-millennials-who-have-savings">Listen to the Millennials (who have savings)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGberGnxiJk">Thomas Lee</a> also agrees, and has been warning us that Millennials are now entering into their peak income years. It turns out Millennials love <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthstock.asp">"growth stocks"</a> (companies which re-invest in themselves and focus on exponential growth).</p>
<p>If TSLA teaches us anything, it is that big disruptive growth stock companies have become too complex for traditional finance to analyze under their existing lense. They'll often blend AI, SAAS, economies of scale, etc. and require a more technologically versed group of analysts to properly price.</p>
<p>Maybe this is something Millenials can do, natively, especially when not pressured by their boomer CEOs while working in the traditional fin jobs? After all, Millenials grew up programming their parents' VCRs.</p>
<p>Another thesis is that <strong>it doesn't matter whether millennials are right or wrong</strong>. They are now calling the shots. If they say it's right, then it's right.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 50.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2050.png"></p>
<h2 id="ditch-your-hedge-fund">Ditch your hedge fund</h2>
<p>We now know that hedge funds are basically a money-making myth:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hedge funds lost 3.8% of assets globally in 2019, the most since 2009" --<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/clients-withdrew-nearly-1-of-all-hedge-fund-assets-in-december-2020-02-18">market watch</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also ditch your financial advisor if they missed all the important trends of 2020. They'll tell you that you cannot live without them; they'll enter self-preservation mode, but remember they make money from you; and the data is showing they should start paying you for advice, not vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="to-sum-up">To sum up</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do your own research, you have access to as much information as investment firms.</li>
<li>Listen to 30 year olds. What companies do they like? <strong>30 year olds dictate the trends</strong>.</li>
<li>Research <strong>good</strong> investment apps: apps that let you directly buy:<ul>
<li>Stocks</li>
<li>Commodities</li>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start <strong>small</strong>, while you learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are now in charge.</p>

<p>As product managers, we are taught to build great products, products that customers really love. Our product management books talk about it loud and clear:</p>

<p>but as you become a product leader – CPO, VP Product, Head of Product – you have an extended responsibility. Creating products that customers love is no longer enough. You have to create products that are business successful. And while it may seem that one leads to the other, this is usually not the case.</p>



<p>It’s true that having a product that customers love is necessary in order to demonstrate business success, but that alone does not guarantee the success you are looking for. It’s a necessary but insufficient condition.</p>



<h2>Kevin Costner Was Wrong</h2>



<p>If you are like me, you probably ask “why” a lot, <a href="https://ganotnoa.com/how-to-translate-ceo-product-ideas-into-actual-products/">and when the CEO asks you to do something</a>, you try to find the reasoning behind it and make sure it makes sense.</p>



<p>If you have tried it long enough, and couldn’t find answers, people might have used the old saying “build it and they will come*” to urge you into action. In other words, if you believe in something, go for it, and the rest will align around it.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, in tech products, this is rarely the case. Even if you create a tighter condition here – “build a great product and business will come” – it still doesn’t hold.</p>



<p>I’m not talking about the fact that you need to market and sell the product (you need it at any point in time, with any product, especially before you have product-market fit). I’m talking about products that even with proper sales and marketing still can’t succeed.</p>



<p>How come? Here are a few examples.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WYLjp8RnairgeyIUDDgeM-4RbrFEZZDhbwknpkHZjET7cc1yegsT54bebBB0a0xeYPEGKRRbq5-pNt1gd-pf-Kubeh9LfCLuU00UfpsEehrYO2vcfQ1_5ZcxuCV3s2-TSoUsZApB" alt=""></figure>



<p><em>* the original quote from the 1989 Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams is “if you build it, he will come”. But nonetheless, the misquote “build it and they will come” has become widely used in business. You can’t trust misquotes 😉</em></p>



<h2>They Love the Product, but Won’t Pay</h2>



<p>The simplest example of why a great product isn’t enough to bring you business success is the following: your customers love the product. They use it, a lot. They recommend it to their friends. They don’t want it to go away. But that’s only true as long as the product is free. They love it, but not enough to pay for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, other business models exist. If you have a wide customer base of people who love your product and use it all the time, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032515/whatsapp-best-facebook-purchase-ever.asp#:~:text=When%20Facebook%20announced%20its%20plans,billion%2C%20or%20%2455%20per%20user.">Facebook might acquire you for $16B</a>. But for us, the mere mortals who are not Google or Facebook, monetization strategy should be a core part of our path to success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another version of this issue is when your customers are willing to pay, but not enough to justify your CAC, or otherwise not enough to build a successful business. Do the math – <strong>what do you need the numbers to be in order to succeed?</strong> Think about short term goals – meeting this year’s revenue goals for example, and long term ones – like keeping a viable, growing business.</p>



<h2>They Love the Product, but Can’t Pay</h2>



<p>Another issue, relevant mostly to B2B products, is when your users love the product, but they are not the ones who make the purchase decision. They also don’t have a budget to allocate for this, and usually can’t justify why this is a good purchase to the decision-makers within their company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is an important rule for building successful B2B products: <strong>you must solve a problem for the buyer, not only for the user</strong>. Even if the buyer is the manager of the users (for example you are selling to the accounting department, and the department manager is the one who makes the decision), they might not see the problem the same way or not feel it is justifying purchasing the product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In your product strategy, you should have a detailed description of the user persona as well as the buyer persona, and make sure you solve the problem that each of them cares about. <strong>Even if that means solving two different problems simultaneously.</strong></p>



<h2>They Love the Product, but They Are the Only Ones</h2>



<p>Tech products require a heavy investment in development. That’s why most startups need VC funding in order to grow. Becoming profitable (even without considering that any revenue is then invested back into development) is a very late stage for startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason VCs are willing to invest huge amounts of money in the risky business of tech startups is the assumption that once the product is built, it can be sold in masses to return the heavy initial investment. Simply put, this means that you should address a huge market from the get-go, otherwise you won’t be able to raise money – no matter how great your product really is.</p>



<p>That is not the only problem with a total addressable market that is too small. If you don’t have a large potential market, most likely you won’t be able to even build a product that your customers love (since you won’t be able to iterate and explore freely). And of course, since you will be nowhere near owning 100% of the market, the overall revenue might be too small.</p>



<p><strong>The business world measures growth, and even worse for you – sustainable growth</strong>. That is, not only you have to show that your business is growing, you have to convince the market that you can maintain and expand this growth rate. If the customers who love your product are not too many, it will be impossible for you to demonstrate the required growth rates.</p>



<h2>Is It a Product Problem?</h2>



<p>Usually when I start working with a new company, one of the first questions that come up is where is the problem exactly. If your product isn’t selling well enough, is it a product issue? Maybe the product is fine, but the sales team isn’t good enough? Or perhaps it’s a marketing problem?</p>



<p>The thing is, that if you look at everything I listed above, these are fundamental issues in the product definition. Not the features definition, not the experience, but still – definitely product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if you have the most talented sales and marketing teams, if you define a product that only speaks to a very small market, they won’t be able to bring more sales. And <a href="https://ganotnoa.com/before-you-deem-your-product-a-failure-check-your-target-audience/">if you define a product that doesn’t work for the buyer and only for the user</a>, guess what – the buyers won’t be convinced and sales won’t happen.</p>



<p><strong>Defining the right product starts with choosing the right problem to solve</strong>. One that is worth paying money for, that is important enough to both the user and the buyer, and that is wide enough for you to build a successful tech company.</p>



<p>Rate your product according to the criteria I just mentioned. How are you doing in each? Start owning the business success of your product by making sure you choose the right problem. Haven’t got a perfect score? It’s never too late to refine the product strategy and pivot. Every successful company you can think of has done it. Maybe you should too.</p>

    <div>
      <p>When used well, TODOs can help you write more robust code and minimise
unhandled edge cases. When used badly, they disappear into your codebase and
are forgotten, marking problems which will never be fixed.</p>
<p>Here’s what I think of as a best-practice system for using TODOs. It treats
them like sticky notes and is made up of two rules and four actions. I call it
“TODO Zero”.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-rules">The two rules</h2>
<p>There are only two rules, and everything flows from them.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Capture every useful thought in a TODO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave no TODOs in shipped code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-four-actions">The four actions</h2>
<p>Something must be done with a TODO which was created because of Rule 1 before
it is deleted because of Rule 2, so the rules give rise to the four actions.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Disregard it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an issue (or ticket) from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert it to a note.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-system">The system</h2>
<p>These rules and actions combine to create a simple system which works like
this.</p>
<p>When you’re writing code and you have a useful idea or thought which isn’t
directly relevant to the code you’re writing at that instant, record it as a
TODO. Then as soon as you’ve done that forget about it and go back to the
code you were writing.</p>
<p>Treat a TODO as a temporary reminder, like a sticky note. It serves two
purposes. The first is to make sure that ideas and insights which you can’t act
on straight away aren’t forgotten. The second is to clear your mind of thoughts
that aren’t relevant to what you’re doing right at that instant.</p>
<p>Over your work session, review the TODOs you’ve written. Your aim for each one
is to use one of the four actions to deal with it, and then delete it. Just
like sticky notes, TODOs are thrown out as soon as they’ve served their purpose
as a reminder, and just like sticky notes, they don’t make it into the final
product.</p>
<p>Before your code reaches the branch from which you ship (i.e. release or
deploy), all the TODOs you’ve created should be deleted. No TODOs should
survive in your finished code, which is where the name <em>TODO Zero</em> comes from.</p>
<h2 id="lets-dive-in">Let’s dive in</h2>
<p>That was the high-level summary, now stay with me as I explain how it works,
why it works and how to best make it work for you.</p>
<p>First, let’s start with a look at the most common problem <em>TODO Zero</em> saves you
from – The Forgotten TODO.</p>
<h2 id="the-forgotten-todo">The Forgotten TODO</h2>
<p>A TODO usually marks something that the person who left it didn’t have the
time, energy or knowledge to take care of.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re coding productively and you don’t want to slow down to handle
an unlikely edge case, so you quickly throw in a comment like this and move on:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># TODO: Handle an empty list.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or you’re racing the clock on a deadline. The function you’ve just finished is
unpleasantly complicated <em>but it works</em>, and so you add a note like this above
it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># TODO: Clean this function up.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or maybe an aspect of what you’re doing is a bit beyond your current
capabilities, so you leave a comment like this behind hoping that someone with
the right skills will see it one day and sort it out:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># TODO: Optimise for large querysets.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s easy to write a TODO and tell ourselves someone will get to it sometime.
But is that what really happens once we finish working with that code? Does
someone get to it, ever? In my experience, the answer is usually “no”.</p>
<p>How often have you stumbled across a TODO in some rarely visited code, only to
ignore it and move on because it’s not relevant to the task at hand? How many
people before you have ignored that same comment, just as you did? And so there
it stays through the ages, forgotten.</p>
<p><em>TODO Zero</em> stops TODOs being forgotten because it requires us to do something
with them rather than letting them sneak into shipped code.</p>
<p>Let’s see how to put it into practice!</p>
<h2 id="rule-1-capture-every-useful-thought-in-a-todo">Rule 1: Capture every useful thought in a TODO</h2>
<p>If you’re anything like me, you’ll have thoughts and realisations about the
code you’re working on faster than you can implement them.</p>
<p>Many of these will be useful, and easily forgotten. If you try to remember
them, you’ll find that they get in the way of you focusing properly on the code
you’re writing, <em>and you’ll still forget some</em>. The less you try to remember,
the lower your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load" target="_blank">cognitive load</a> and the more clearly you can think.</p>
<p>It’s much better to capture them in TODOs as they come to you, as if you were
jotting them down quickly on sticky notes. Do this and you can come back and
take care of each one when you have time and can give it your full attention.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’ve just finishing writing the signature of the <code>display_errors</code>
function when two edge cases it will need to handle come to mind. You can
capture them like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>display_errors</span>(error_list):
    <span># TODO: Handle a really long list. Truncate and add count of hidden items?</span>
    <span># TODO: Handle error messages with &gt;100 characters.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s better to get the main path through the function fleshed out before
shifting focus to handle those edge cases, so you make them into TODOs and
forget about them for now.</p>
<p>Then let’s say you’re only two lines into <code>display_errors</code> when you have a
realisation about the thread-safety of the <code>build_pdf</code> function you wrote an
hour ago. Again, capture it in a TODO. It doesn’t matter where. You can put it
right where you’re working for the time being and move it later:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>display_errors</span>(error_list):
    <span>for</span> error <span>in</span> error_list:
        <span>print</span>(error)
    <span># TODO: Ensure that build_pdf function is thread-safe.</span>
    <span># TODO: Handle a really long list. Truncate and add hidden item count?</span>
    <span># TODO: Handle error messages with &gt;100 characters.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When you use TODOs in this way, you ensure that every realisation and edge case
which occurs to you is recorded and will be dealt with. Once recorded they
can’t fall through the cracks, so your code will be more robust.</p>
<p>Because a TODO is now just a note to yourself, don’t take time making it
detailed or perfect. You’re the only one who will read it. As long as you can
understand it, that’s all that matters. Just like a sticky note.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_%28author%29" target="_blank">David Allen's</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" target="_blank">Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology</a> will recognise what I’ve just
described as what he calls “ubiquitous capture”. Which is really just another
way of saying that if you have a good idea, record it somewhere so you don’t
forget it.</p>
<h2 id="rule-2-leave-no-todos-in-shipped-code">Rule 2: Leave no TODOs in shipped code</h2>
<p>The TODOs you create represent tasks you need to do, problems you need to solve
or ideas you need to consider as part of the work you’re doing.</p>
<p>Every single one should be addressed and then removed before the code reaches
the branch you ship from.</p>
<p>By addressing them all, you gain the confidence of knowing that every potential
problem or issue which occurred to you has been dealt with, so your code is as
thorough as you can make it.</p>
<p>Addressing a TODO requires you to <em>do something with it</em> so that it is no
longer needed. That means applying one of the four actions – disregard it, do
it, create an issue from it or convert it to a note. I’ll explain each of them
in more detail shortly.</p>
<p>As you progress through the work you’re doing, take some time now and then to
look over the TODOs you’ve made. When the time is right for each one, do
something with it and then delete it.</p>
<p>I use this <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction" target="_blank">Makefile</a> target which lists all TODOs to help with that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span>todos</span>:
    @grep -r -v <span>"| grep TODO"</span> . | grep TODO
</code></pre></div>
<p>You should find that as you get closer to finishing there are fewer and fewer
remaining. When you finish, ensure that there are none left at all. Your code
is not complete until they have all been addressed and removed.</p>
<p>Again, think of a TODO like a sticky note. It’s a scrappy short-term reminder
that doesn’t belong in a finished product and is disposed of when it has served
its purpose.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at each of the four actions.</p>
<h2 id="action-1-disregard-it">Action 1: Disregard it</h2>
<p><em>Sometimes you’re wrong.</em></p>
<p>When you record all the thoughts and ideas that cross your mind, once you come
back later to give them your full attention, it’s inevitable that some will
turn out to be junk, or mistakes, or just not worth doing.</p>
<p>Maybe you thought you saw an edge case where there wasn’t one. Maybe what
seemed like a good idea turns out to be a bad idea. Maybe you saw an
opportunity for an optimisation which would actually be too time-consuming to
be worth doing.</p>
<p>Not to worry. When you come across a TODO like this, disregard it, delete it,
and move on.</p>
<h2 id="action-2-do-it">Action 2: Do it</h2>
<p><em>Sometimes you’re right.</em></p>
<p>Often a TODO contains a good idea that’s worth doing, and worth doing now.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s an easy optimisation. Maybe it’s dealing with an edge case.</p>
<p>If it’s necessary to complete your work, or if it’s not but you think it’s
worth doing now anyway, do it. Then once you’ve done it, delete that TODO.</p>
<h2 id="action-3-create-an-issue-or-ticket-from-it">Action 3: Create an issue (or ticket) from it.</h2>
<p><em>Sometimes it can wait for later.</em></p>
<p>There will be some TODOs which describe something which will need to be done
eventually, but which can wait until after your code is shipped.</p>
<p>For each of these, create an issue from it in the project’s issue tracker, then
delete the TODO.</p>
<p>Although some people argue that in cases like this leaving TODOs in shipped
code is an effective way to track tasks that need to be done, I disagree. I’m a
believer in the benefits of having a single source of truth for work to be
done. When an issue tracker isn’t tracking <em>all</em> the work for a project, you
undermine its effectiveness, and I say that because my experience is that
what’s not in the issue tracker doesn’t get done.</p>
<h2 id="action-4-convert-it-to-a-note">Action 4: Convert it to a note.</h2>
<p><em>Sometimes it’s just not going to happen.</em></p>
<p>Some TODOs fall into the category of “in a perfect world we’d address that, but
it’s never likely to be important enough to worry about”.</p>
<p>In my experience, these are often the ones which flag edge cases which are
either very unlikely to arise, or won’t have worrying consequences when they
do, or both.</p>
<p>It’s not appropriate to create issues about these in your issue tracker,
because you don’t actually intend to do anything about them.</p>
<p>But it is helpful to convert them into NOTEs which point out the shortcomings
of the code for the benefit of people who will work with it in the future.</p>
<p>As an example, you …</p></div></div></div>

          <h2>AM010</h2>

<p>It was late at night when I realized it was about to happen again.</p>
<p>The existing publishing tools I had at hand weren't particularly good to
showcase what I had in mind, but they were convenient enough that I could just
write and leave the problem of actually reading them to whoever happened to
land on that blog.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just a blog. Starting out with 8 patrons, the traffic it got was
mostly friends. They could bear with it.</p>
<p>But the unfortunate reality is that I can't quite stand watching something
being done poorly. It just broils in my gut the feeling that <em>we can do
better</em>. Editing could be simpler. Publishing could be faster. Thinking could
be easier.</p>
<p>I will try to best it, even if the end result ends up being worse, and while
I'll be the first to admit that perhaps it isn't the most attractive of
qualities, it always teaches me something new. Every now and then I do
manage to do it better. The world around me is a little better for it.</p>
<p>This time I had to sit down and write something. I didn't quite know what yet,
but I knew that how I had been writing was getting in the way of what I wanted
to write. So I took a step back and asked around how are the <em>cool kids</em> doing
it this days.</p>
<p>Many seem to like tools like <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a>, or
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. They all provide some sort of structure or template you fit your
content into, a couple of ways to do theming and navigation, and the
possibility to run the whole shebang as a static or dynamically generated
service.</p>
<p>I just needed some static files, and I needed them in the structure they were
already in, so from the choices I was offered it looked like the winner was in
fact Next.js. It came with a few interesting features that I dismissed as
<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?BellsWhistlesAndGongs">whistles &amp; bells</a>, and frowned at the requirement that
my pages would have to be translated into React components.</p>
<p>Surely a tool with such an emphasis on the "Developer Experience" would
consider the many formats my data could be in, and accommodate for it. But I
nonetheless decided to translate an essay into some Javascript code, and I
finally felt like I could start writing.</p>
<p>Until I had to embed some code.</p>
<p>Suddenly I was somehow recommended to go down the rabbit of hole of finding
good Javascript component libraries that would do the highlighting for me, that
worked with Next, from withing my own writing, which was now no longer just
text but in fact <em>a computer program posing as an essay</em>.</p>
<p>A quick look under the hood showed me there were over 100,000 lines of
Javascript code to turn my untranscendental words into a god damned website.</p>
<p><em>I sighed</em>.</p>
<p>There is a tolerable amount of complexity involved in doing our every day work.
I use <code>vim</code> and, on my computer, it runs on the Linux kernel. I tolerate the
many millions of lines of code from there down to the hardware it runs.
<strong>Tolerance</strong> here is the key word. They afford me things. Not physical things
like food, but the affordance that your thinking gains when you discover a new
idea.</p>
<p>When I first learned about <code>git</code> I suddenly had a new tool to think. I wasn't
familiar with branching models of Subversion or other versioning tools, but
<code>git</code>'s branches, merges, and code history extended my thinking. I have a vague
understanding of the internals of <code>git</code>, but I <strong>tolerate</strong> this complexity
because of what it affords me.</p>
<p>What was this tool really affording me with this complexity? I already had to
pay the cost of translating my content into the format it wanted of me, what
else is there? Hot reloading of assets. Great. My assets are stylesheet files,
the occasional image, and one or two embedded scripts. I can already refresh
a browser with a keypress. What else is there?</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this tools just doesn't support my use-case very well.
How can something so enormously popular and complicated as Next.js not support
my so seemingly simple use-case? I had to be wrong. Where is all this
complexity heading that I can't leverage it without bringing in even more of
it?</p>
<p>Some complexity exists because the underlying problem is in fact complex. It
needs to be dealt with and it cannot be reduced any further. We tend to call
this <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf"><em>Essential Complexity</em></a>. Did all the complexity
in Next exist only to justify <strong>making me feel productive</strong>?</p>
<p>I started wondering what really was so essentially complex about what I needed
to do, but it didn't take long to put a list of the things that seemed the most
independent from each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd like my Markdown files to be compiled into their corresponding HTML
files, respecting their existing structure</li>
<li>I'd like them to be optionally templated, to share some framing information</li>
<li>I'd like to only do work that needs to be done</li>
<li>I'd like my files to be served in a browser fast, and</li>
<li>I'd like my files to be updated automatically in the browser</li>
</ul>
<p>There were them. 5 requirements that this problem could be broken into.  It
shouldn't take more than a couple of days to explore each one of them in enough
depth to understand whether I was looking at massive Essential Complexity, or
not.</p>
<p>I decided to build this tool.</p>
<h4>1. Compiling Markdown to HTML</h4>
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/introducing_markdown">Markdown</a> was introduced as a more humane way to write HTML. It has
evolved from a rather moving target of inconsistent syntaxes into a series of
standards, some describing a fairly complex format with plenty of features.</p>
<p>To build a Markdown to HTML compiler I'd have to be clear about <em>which</em>
Markdown format I'd be supporting. Since my content was currently written
mostly following <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm">Github Flavored Markdown</a>, that
seemed like the Markdown to target.</p>
<p>Every compiler has a series of stages that take the initial source code, or a
similar specification of a program, and turns into another language. Some
compilers turn this source code into machine language, some others just turn it
into another high-level language.</p>
<p>Whichever your target is, chances are the compiler will read some binary
strings (sometimes this is just UTF-8 text, sometimes its actual binary encoded
data), and transform them into something that it can operate on. Then it
proceeds to transform these data structures into something that more closely
resembles the desired output, maybe making some checks along the way.</p>
<p>In my case, I designed it to have 3 stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsing of Markdown text — a parsing phase would require a Markdown
parser that would deal with the quirks of GFM, and the CommonMark spec it
builds on.</li>
<li>Transformation between Markdown structures and an HTML tree — this
would take data structures like <code>Paragraph { content: String }</code> or <code>List { elements: Vec&lt;ListElement&gt; }</code> and turn them into the appropriate HTML tree.</li>
<li>Writing out the HTML tree — which would take an <code>DomNode { tag: DomTag, attributes: Vec&lt;DomAttribute&gt;, children: Vec&lt;DomNode&gt; }</code> and turn it into a
String that can be written into a file.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can imagine some scaffolded code for this to look like:</p>
<pre><code>enum MarkdownNode {
  Heading1(Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt;), // corresponding to a #
  Heading2(Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt;), // corresponding to a ##
  Blockquote(Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt;), // corresponding to series of &gt;
  // ...
}

struct MarkdownDoc { nodes: Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt; }

enum HtmlTag { P, H1, /* ... */ }
struct HtmlAttribute { key: String, value: String }
enum HtmlNode {
  Tagged { 
    tag: HtmlTag,
    attributes: Option&lt;Vec&lt;HtmlAttribute&gt;&gt;,
    children: Option&lt;Vec&lt;HtmlNode&gt;&gt;
  },
  Literal {
    child: String
  }
}

fn string_to_markdown(input: String) -&gt; Result&lt;MarkdownNode, Error&gt; {}

fn markdown_to_html(md: MarkdownDoc) -&gt; Result&lt;HtmlNode, Error&gt; {}

fn html_to_string(html: HtmlNode) -&gt; String {}
</code></pre>
<p>It took me about an hour of reading the specification to realize that
implementing a parser for the entire syntax would easily take me over a week,
and I don't have that kind of time. It would likely be a very error prone
process as well.</p>
<p>A very fun thing to work on, for sure, but after understanding this specific
problem better, I can <em>tolerate</em> the complexity of bringing in a 3rd party
Markdown compiler into the table.</p>
<h4>2. Templating</h4>
<p>Templating can take many shapes and forms. From full blown programming language
support in the style of <a href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb">ERB (Embedded RuBy)</a>, to string
matching and replacing in more mundane forms.</p>
<p>Considering I do not need to perform any specific logic, my templating needs
are closer to a string-matching followed by some splitting and joining.</p>
<p>I have a <code>template.html</code> file that somewhere in the middle has a keyword that I
want replaced with the actual content of the essay I'm writing.</p>
<p>In pseudocode, this should be enough to achieve my goal:</p>
<pre><code>do_template(template, content) do
  [before, after] = template.split_at_word("$$document")
  return [before, content, after]
end
</code></pre>
<p>How exactly we are finding the word to be replaced by the content is less
important, but from the vast bibliography out there I keep a copy of <a href="https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/FPMbook">Flexible
Pattern Matching in Strings</a> that is a good resource to
implement some of these algorithms.</p>
<p>Once you know where to split the template to inject your content, the rest is
just string concatenation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, modern programming languages excel at providing us with string
manipulation tools, so putting it together took almost as much code as the
pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>// assume content and template are strings already
let compiled = template.replace("$$document", content);
</code></pre>
<p>For my use-case, the complexity of having an entire incrementally-rendering
component framework like React, to reuse components across pages that would
achieve the same effect, is simply <strong>not tolerable</strong>.</p>
<h4>3. Only doing work that needs to be done</h4>
<p>A lot of the tools we work with do the same thing over and over again.
Sometimes that is okay. Sometimes that is mandatory.</p>
<p>For my use-case, because I'd like to keep the output of the compilation
versioned, the compilation process should only redo the work that needs to be
done.</p>
<p>This has the side-benefit that recompiling these documents should be relatively
fast, since I tend to work on a single document at a time. Occasionally a
change in a template file would trigger only the recompilation of the documents
using it, …</p></section></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Life as an introvert</strong> is rarely easy. Ever since I graduated, Iâ€™ve been compelled to work in open-plan offices. Itâ€™s exhausting. Imagine being engaged in a task that requires high concentration, such as looking for a lost earing in the middle of a tennis court. Now imagine that an automatic ball launcher keeps shooting balls directly at you. Wouldnâ€™t you get tired quickly, and be much less efficient in your search? This is how I feel during my work, when sudden and repeating distractions are â€˜shotâ€™ at or near my desk.</p>
<p>The struggle of an introvert doesnâ€™t end in the office. Networking at conferences, some with thousands of attendees, is a central part of an academic career. Picture yourself entering a huge hall, with bright neon lights, hundreds of people in each aisle, and a background din that forces you to yell to be heard. In a typical two-hour poster session, youâ€™re expected to acquire the information you need while also efficiently introducing your own work to colleagues. As an introvert, the experience is equal to riding a terrifying rollercoaster while having to maintain a big smile on your face.</p>
<p>I wish I could say these types of challenge are limited to the work environment, but thatâ€™s not the case. For my most recent birthday, a friend bought me a dinner at EatWith â€“ a meal-sharing platform. Youâ€™re invited to dine in the house of strangers who cook for you and other participating guests. I would enjoy the food and cultural experience if I didnâ€™t have to go through the excruciating labour of small talk with random people. â€˜Sounds like fun,â€™ I said politely to my friend, but privately my immediate sense was that this was yet another ill-designed platform for introverts.</p>
<p>Today, as a psychologist, I know that introversion is a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2015/12/11/personality-and-interest-in-science-health-topics/">common</a> trait. Unlike shyness, which is more about a fear of being judged negatively, introversion is defined as a preference for quiet, less stimulating environments. The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung was the first to propose differentiating individuals along an introvert-extravert axis. Writing in the 1920s, he <a href="http://www.cyjack.com/cognition/(ebook%20pdf)%20jung,%20carl%20-%20the%20psychological%20types.pdf">described</a> introverts as preferring to direct their attention inward, to their own feelings and thoughts, and how they lose energy during social interactions. Extraverts, by contrast, direct their attention outward, gain energy from social interactions, and lose energy during periods of solitude.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1950s, the German-born psychologist Hans Eysenck proposed a physiological explanation for the difference between introverts and extraverts. Extraverts, he <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1964.tb00912.x">said</a>, have a lower baseline level of cortical arousal relative to introverts, leading them to search for external stimulation to increase their motivation, attention and alertness. Introvertsâ€™ higher baseline arousal levels, in contrast, lead them to withdraw. Contemporary psychology still considers the introversion-extraversion distinction a core aspect of personality (it is one of the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-09869-001">so-called</a> â€˜Big Fiveâ€™ traits), although it is seen as a continuous spectrum along which we are all positioned, rather than a dichotomous state.</p>
<p>Although thereâ€™s no definitive way of identifying the proportion of introverts in the population, Susan Cain, an influential thinker in the field, has made a reasonable <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/296/296443/quiet-power/9780241977910.html">estimate</a> that at least a third of people are at one end of this spectrum. The third on the other end are extraverts, and the final third fall somewhere in between â€“ some <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327752jpa4305_14">call</a> these people â€˜ambivertsâ€™. Knowing that introverts comprise an approximately equal share of the population as extraverts, I keep wondering about the missing 33 per cent â€“ where are all the introverts in the ocean of extraverts that surround me in my daily life?</p>
<p>Many of the decisions relating to the daily life of introverts are in the hands of extraverts</p>
<p><strong>While I have introverted</strong> friends, they seem to be vastly outnumbered by my extraverted friends and acquaintances. I have to remind myself that this apparent absence from my daily landscape is not surprising: we introverts are much harder to notice. Introverts probably wonâ€™t be the ones sharing a joke with the entire office, waiting by the coffee machine for a chance to chat, or appearing on television screens as rising reality-show stars. On the contrary, theyâ€™re more likely to enjoy some quiet time by themselves or with a few selected friends, to process their thoughts silently before saying them out loud, and to retreat to their quiet-place to recharge after social interactions.</p>
<p>While the higher visibility of extraverts is self-explanatory, it is far from trivial. Not only does it mean introversion is perceived as less common than it really is, but also introverts are less likely to be evenly represented in influential social groups, including in politics. We risk missing the immense contribution of a large percentage of our employees, students, trainees and friends.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0894439312462802">example</a>, extraverts are more likely to take part in political engagements, such as disseminating political messages and signing petitions, both on the internet and offline. Negative political messages, which seem so common nowadays, <a href="https://jspp.psychopen.eu/article/view/280">deter</a> introverts from participating in politics, while having the opposite influence on extraverts, including increasing their likelihood of voting, rallying or volunteering for a political campaign. Extraverts are more <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001472">active</a> on social media. They also have easier access to higher corporate ranks, due to the high attention they draw to themselves and to social <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fire.12173">stereotypes</a> that associate extravert characteristics with leadership. This state of affairs leaves many of the decisions relating to the daily life of introverts in the hands of the extraverts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the greater representation of extraverts in social and political life is self-perpetuating. Working conditions chosen by extraverts to suit extraverts increase the burden on introverts. For instance, group meetings, in which each participant contributes thoughts in a disorganised, dominance-based manner, can put introverts at a disadvantage. The overabundance of extraverts in managing and recruitment roles also decreases the likelihood of introverts winning promotion due to whatâ€™s <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-02267-014">called</a> the â€˜similarity biasâ€™ â€“ our tendency to prefer people who are similar to ourselves. This is not only unfair to introverts, itâ€™s to the detriment of organisations.</p>
<p>Leadership is commonly associated with extraversion, but history teaches us that introverts can serve as powerful leaders. Rosa Parks, a leading activist in the American civil rights movement, was quiet and reserved. Her brave actions, more than her words, led to a crucial turning-point in the struggle. Similarly, while serving as US president, Barack Obama eagerly protected his solitude in the evenings, spending the time reading and concentrating on work decisions. His preference for small group outings rather than big social events didnâ€™t deprive him of extraordinary communication skills and the ability to make bold decisions. In <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10904018.2016.1202770">contrast</a> to the mistaken perception of introverts as snobbish, misanthropic or depressed, we can be highly empathic, with strong communicative skills.</p>
<p>But itâ€™s not a case of establishing whether introverts or extraverts make better leaders, rather each brings something different, and diversity is often key to effective leadership. For <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11365-014-0334-3">instance</a>, entrepreneurial teams perform better when leadership is shared between individuals, but only if they have diverse personality traits. Moreover, teams dominated by extraverted members <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-15936-006">actually</a> perform better under introverted leaders, possibly due to their greater responsiveness to their employeesâ€™ ideas.</p>
<p>Introversion is not something to be fixed â€“ but a blessed source of human diversity</p>
<p>The main cultural problem is that introverts are widely seen as not adapted to the environment, instead of it being acknowledged that the environment is designed to profit extraverts. Societyâ€™s praise and acceptance of extraversion as the norm has led many introverts, along with many ambiverts, to suppress different aspects of their personality, or to see them as flaws. This state of affairs is bad not only for introverts, but for society as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>The bias begins already</strong> in the first grade of school. Learning in a big classroom environment might be cost-efficient, but is by no means the best model for everyone. Some kids, especially the introverts, will struggle in the continuous company of a large number of others and the constant requirement to engage in group work. The same misconception â€“ placing the onus on introverts to change â€“ is also reflected in the recent <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-18181-001">proposal</a> that introverts would be happier if only they â€˜acted more extravertedâ€™, even if acting this way counteracts their natural tendencies.</p>
<p>Simple changes across society could be made to mitigate the inequities faced by introverts. In the educational system, for example, designated private spaces in schools could enable periodic shelter for those introverted kids and others who need a place to recharge. Introverts could also profit from greater access to online learning and sharing platforms, with asynchronous communication <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-0625-8_15">enabling</a> them to think and research an area without the pressure to respond immediately. Creating equal opportunities for participation in class, such as giving students time to think, the autonomy to decide to work alone or to write their ideas instead of presenting them verbally, could also help rebalance the traditional inequity.</p>
<p>In business and academic settings, workers should have more autonomy in choosing their working conditions. In meetings, stating the topics to be discussed in advance could allow more time for introverts to prepare and process the information. Allocating time for each attendee to speak could also give introverts the chance to express their thoughts. There should be more questioning of whether group meetings are necessarily the best platform for disseminating …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>A core motivation for building DoltHub was to empower organizations to collaboratively create and maintain high quality data assets that they could collectively depend on. This is very much analogous to GitHub. Analogies are powerful ways to articulate an idea when an appropriate one is already widely understood. In our case a large community of developers, and technology adjacent businesses more broadly, understand GitHub, and how it enabled a revolution in open source software. It's therefore straightforward for us to explain our product in terms of an analogy.</p>
<p>The balance of this article is about the, relatively nascent, open data ecosystem, and the similarities and differences with the the open source software ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Open Source Software</h2>
<p>Collaborative public development of software is not necessary for it to be considered "open source", this is a characteristic of the distribution licensing, but when one uses the term "open source" that is normally what is implicitly understood. Indeed at various points in my career assessing whether to adopt a tool often involved gauging how "vibrant" the "community" around that tool was. What does this mean in specifically?</p>
<ul>
<li>gauging the level of mailing list activity, JIRA board back and forth, or GitHub issues to see a healthy interest in the tool, that is a user base</li>
<li>checking Git commit logs to see if there is a healthy base of contributors</li>
</ul>
<p>The fundamental thing this kind of analysis seeks to establish is a qualitative sense of whether a <em>healthy</em> dynamic exists around the project. At a fundamental level marginal users must see value in the project, and some fraction of them must be willing to convert to contributors in order to sustain the project. If significant investment is attracted, then the user base can grow as the project in creases in scope and quality, thus becoming a solution to more and more problems. This is the "flywheel" that sustains open source projects that allow companies to drop in pieces of software infrastructure that they might otherwise have to buy or maintain. The existence of the open source alternative allows these companies to compare the cost of buying or building to having a stake in a free to use tool, usually outside their core competency.</p>
<p>This is not a scientific, or exhaustive, theory of open source software project dynamics, but it seems a reasonable first approximation of the dynamic that drives companies to seek to employ open source contributors to projects that constitute a critical part of their infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Open Data</h2>
<p>To start to gauge the relevance of this analogy at the level of "project dynamics", I performed a quick Google search:
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/images/open-data-project-google-search.png">Open Data Projects Google Search</a></p>
<p>The first, non-paid, article is a blog by a SaaS business focused on "spatial data science", and so while data sources may be interesting, they are picked because they compliment Carto's business thesis of the value of geo spatial data. Furthermore, most of the identified "projects" are the work of an individual or organization publishing, rather than the kind of distributed collaboration we identified as the core of the open source software development model.</p>
<p>The next two links are initiatives by the government to make data publicly available. While government data can be great, the existence of single publisher is the essence of its value. We then have Kaggle, a well known platform for machine learning competitions. Since a necessary prerequisite for a machine learning competition is a dataset, Kaggle hosts a lot of free datasets. However, they tend to be tailored toward the competition, and most are not updated, nor is there any concept of collaboration on a single dataset. We then reach some summary articles, probably what we were really looking for, that identify interesting and compelling "open data." However, again these data sources are mostly organizations and governments, or quasi government, entities <em>publishing</em>.</p>
<p>It seems pretty clear that the term "open data" often just means "available data", a one directional relationship where individuals and organizations can consume a data source passively. But how are organizations that have a shared interest in a dataset that is necessary but not a core competitive advantage supposed to collaborate?</p>
<p>Let's dig into an example.</p>
<h2>Open Elections</h2>
<p>One interesting open data project that looks bit like open source software is Open Elections. We have <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-01-open-elections/">blogged about</a> the project in the past. Recapping, the goal of the project is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is to create the first free, comprehensive, standardized, linked set of election data for the United States, including federal and statewide offices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interest in voting data is broad, and is driven by both professional and personal motivations. Furthermore, many organizations have an interest in voting data, but lack the financial resources to buy it. Many commercial grade solutions, such as the associated press, are tailored to large media organizations with big budgets and low latency tolerance. This is not a good trade off for researchers or campaigns. Open Elections seeks to democratize access to this data by making high quality precinct level results available.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of wide interest in the data there is a sizable base of contributors. It's not hard to imagine that a researcher or enthusiast sees the Open Elections <a href="http://openelections.net/">homepage</a>, and realizes that with a small outlay of effort they can extend the dataset to meet their needs. They <em>convert from a user to a contributor</em>. This looks much more like open source software than random quasi-governmental agencies pushing out collections of CSVs whenever they see fit. To be clear, this is not to be scoffed at, but it's an entirely different model of data distribution.</p>
<p>Open Elections is managed via GitHub, which makes sense as that's the most notable platform around for administering a project with this dynamic. It's also free to use, widely understood, and the product is mature and well executed. However, one shortcoming of using data in a format such as CSV is that the format itself is "loose", it is after all a file format. Databases are a file format in a sense, but differ hugely in they require a program to edit the format. In essence that program, the query engine, "gates" interactions with the format, which in turn enables much stronger "guarantees" to be presented. These guarantees are described by a schema, and enable the use of a query language. Dolt uses SQL. Datasets store in a database are much more work to build than collections of data files separated by commas, but when data arrives in a database the time to value is radically compressed. We published a subset of the Open Elections data as a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/open-elections/voting-data">Dolt repository</a>, which does a nice job of illustrating the power of the distribution model.</p>
<p>This is the core value proposition of Dolt to the open data community, it offers mechanism for building high quality production grade resources, and delivering a uniquely seamless consumption experience to users of the data.</p>
<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>Putting data in relational databases is hard. The analogy to open source software would be unit tests. While the existence of such a "forcing function" to quality makes the life of the contributor harder by raising the barrier to creating a successful contribution, it also greatly elevates the experience of the marginal user.</p>
<p>That forcing function, using a database with Git-like features for managing open data project, is essential to our vision for Dolt and DoltHub in the open data world. We see Dolt the database, and the collaboration features built on top of it for DoltHub, as having the potential to elevate the quality of the data assets that come out of open data projects such that businesses are more willing to rely on them, and therefore invest in the projects themselves.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To recap, we have used the analogy of open source code, and Git and GitHub, to articulate the goals of Dolt and DoltHub in many places, including this blog. While the analogy is a powerful communication tool, it does tend to gloss over the key differences between the dynamics at play in collaborative process design, open source software, and collaborative fact assembly, open data.</p>
<p>One reason that we believe open data projects have not taken off is lack of tools that make it easy for contributors to publish high quality data assets that clear the threshold of quality such that commercial enterprises see them as viable alternatives to proprietary and paid solutions. Dolt and DoltHub represent our attempt to facilitate collaboration that creates high quality data assets that can become reliable dependencies.</p></div></div>]]>

            <p>JSON Web Tokens has become the favorite choice among modern developers when implementing user authentication. JWT’s popularity is clearly justified by what it brings to application development. In this post, we are looking deep into JWTs and why they stand out among other authentication options, as well as what you should be concerned about when using them.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-jwt-token">What is a JWT token?</h2>
<p>A JWT is a self-contained method that can be used securely transmit data between two endpoints. JWTs are most commonly used for user authentication. They can also be used to securely exchange information. In this post, we are covering how JWTs are used for user authentication. However, information exchange using JWT follows roughly the same steps as user authentication.</p>
<p>The authentication process involving JWTs follows these steps. When a user first logs into the application, system backend issues a JWT to the user and sends it to the client-side. This token contains a special signature that validates the token as a one issued by the system. The client stores the token in the browser and sends it with every request to the server, where the token is used to verify the user’s authentication.</p>
<p>A JWT consists of 3 strings separated by periods. The 3 of them are the header, payload, and the signature. Follows is an example JWT token made of these 3 parts.</p>

<p>Let’s see what each of these parts contributes to the overall makeup of the token.</p>

<p>JWT header contains metadata about the token in JSON format. Two fields present in the header are alg and typ. ’alg’ specifies the algorithm used to sign the token when generating the signature, which we will talk about in a moment. ’typ’ specifies the type of the token, which is ’JWT’. A typical token header is shown in the following example.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"alg"</span>: <span>"RS256"</span>,
    <span>"typ"</span>: <span>"JWT"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here, the header states the algorithm used to sign the token is RS256.</p>
<p>The header is stored as the first part of the token after being encoded in base64url.</p>
<h3 id="payload">Payload</h3>
<p>The payload of a JWT stores information about the token and any other entity in JSON format. Usually, a JWT used for authentication stores some crucial information about the user, such as the user ID and user role. Token storing user information usually looks like this.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"id"</span>: <span>"1234591"</span>,
    <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Mary Poppins"</span>,
    <span>"role"</span>: <span>"editor"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>These JSON fields stored in the payload are known as claims.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some claims that are defined by the JWT standard. It’s not necessary to include all these claims in a JWT, but including at least some of them will be beneficial in most situations. Here are a few standard claims that we can use.</p>
<ul>
<li>iss: Defines the issuer of the token.</li>
<li>exp: Provides an expiration time to the token. Once this expiration time is passed, the token is no longer valid.</li>
<li>aud: Defines the audience of the token.</li>
<li>iat: Stores the time the token was issued at.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see how a payload with some standard claims looks like.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"id"</span>: <span>"1234591"</span>,
    <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Mary Poppins"</span>,
    <span>"role"</span>: <span>"editor"</span>,
    <span>"iss"</span>: <span>"mywebsite.com"</span>,
    <span>"exp"</span>: <span>3600</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>The payload of a JWT can include as many fields of information as you want, but it’s recommended to keep the size as small as possible. Also, you should not store sensitive information like user passwords in the payload since it is not encrypted. It’s simply encoded in base64url encoding.</p>
<h3 id="signature">Signature</h3>
<p>The last part of a JWT token, the signature, is a Message Authentication Code that is used to verify the token was not modified or generated by an outsider except the authorized application servers.</p>
<p>Signature is generated by signing the combined JWT header and payload using an encryption algorithm and a secret stored in the server. Only someone who has the token’s header and payload and the secret can generate a sign accepted by the server. So, it is important to use a strong secret to encrypt tokens and securely store it in the server.</p>
<p>If we use a symmetric algorithm like HMAC SHA-256, the server issuing the JWT and the server validating the JWT should have secure access to the secret. If an asymmetric algorithm like RS256 is used, we can use a public-private key system, where a private key is used to sign the token and a public key is used to validate it.</p>
<p>As you have already guessed, the signature is the most crucial part of a JWT token. It keeps unauthenticated sources out of the application and keeps everything secure. When the issued JWT is sent back to the server with every request from the client-side, the server checks the signature to validate that it’s a token issued by the system itself and then proceed to serve the client request.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-so-special-about-jwt">What is so special about JWT?</h2>
<p>As we got to know the makeup of a JWT token, you might have been thinking about what makes it so special compared to other authentication methods, especially session-based authentication.</p>
<p>The most important characteristic of JWT that makes it special is its statelessness. We saw what sort of data can be stored in a JWT in the previous section, and all the data that are needed to verify the token and identify the user are stored in the token itself. There is no need to maintain any record of the token in the server, like store the token in a database as we do with sessions. This makes JWTs stateless.</p>
<p>This stateless nature gives us the biggest benefit that comes with JWTs: The server that issues the JWT and the server that validates it does not have to be the same. One server can issue JWTs and carry out authentication tasks, while the other server that implements application logic can validate the JWT independent of the first server.</p>
<p>In the age of API backends and microservices-architecture applications, this allows the developers to delegate all authentication tasks to one server while the others implement application logic, and decouple the system as much as possible.</p>
<p>When JWT issuing and validating is carried out by separate servers, using a public-private key system is the best approach to take. In this case, the private key should be stored securely in the authentication server.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-to-send-jwt-tokens-from-client-side-to-the-server-and-vice-versa">How to send JWT tokens from client-side to the server and vice-versa?</h2>
<p>When sending the JWT back and forth between the server and the client, we can send it along with the Authorization HTTP header. However, sending tokens over HTTP connections makes them susceptible to Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks and stolen tokens. Therefore, it is essential to use secure HTTP connections when using JWTs.</p>
<p>Another problem with sending the token in the HTTP header is, in this approach, the token is usually stored in the local storage of the client-side browser. This exposes the tokens to being stolen using Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.</p>
<p>As a solution to this, you can send the token inside a cookie instead of inside the Authorization header. It’s essential to set HttpOnly and secure flags of the cookie to prevent attackers from stealing tokens using XSS attacks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="expire-your-jwt-tokens">Expire your JWT tokens</h2>
<p>If in some way a JWT token is stolen by a third-party, they can use the stolen token to access the application and gain the token owner’s privileges. As a solution to this problem, we can set a short expiration time for the JWTs. This way, even if an attacker steals a token, they cannot make use of it for a time long enough to make an undesirable impact.</p>
<p>We can set the exp claim inside the payload to give a short expiration time to the token. However, this action does not eliminate the threat of stolen tokens, just reduces the chances of it leading to a serious attack.</p>
<p>In real-world applications, setting a short expiration time to JWTs is not as simple as it sounds. If we created tokens that expire after ten minutes of creation, it will drastically reduce the user experience of your application’s users. How likely are the users to tolerate having to re-login every 10 minutes they spend on your application?</p>
<p>But there is a solution to this: refresh tokens.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="refresh-tokenswhat-are-they">Refresh tokens—what are they?</h2>
<p>Since asking the users to log in again after every time a JWT token expires within a short time is not a good solution, developers have found a solution to this in refresh tokens.</p>
<p>The refresh token is a JWT token with a longer expiration time. It is used to issue a new access token, which is also a JWT token but with a shorter expiration time, every time the old access token expires.</p>
<p>In this situation, the access token is the token that is sent back and forth between the client and the server and has a short expiration time. However, when the access token expires within a short time, instead of asking the user to log in again, the server uses the refresh token to generate a new access token. Refresh token stores data needed to create a new access token.</p>







    
        
        
    


<figure data-src="/post/2020-07-31-a-brief-introduction-to-securing-applications-with-jwt/jwt_refresh_hueb0266c7bdf0d6b3156eda2d402fdf7f_57584_700x0_resize_box_2.png">

</figure>

<p>Since refresh token has a long expiration time and it is not being passed to the client-side in any case, we should store them in a backend database. If an attacker somehow gets access to a refresh token, it’s a serious security threat to the system and the owner of the refresh token given their long expiration time. So, refresh tokens must be stored under maximum security measures.</p>
<p>A user first receives a refresh token when they login to the system. Then, the token is stored in a secure database. Issuing a new refresh token every time a new access token is generated is something you can do to ensure that the security impact of stolen refresh tokens is low.</p>
<p>When a refresh token expires, the user has to log in to the application again and get a new refresh token.</p>
<p>If JWT issuing and validating are handled by separate servers, …</p></section></div>

Rebuilding the app from scratch may have not been the best choice, but during that process I have massively simplified the app's data structure, despaghettified some messy UI code, and spent two full days trying to solve a problem that didn't exist. This is the story of that last bit.</p> <h2 id="-structural-changes">## Structural Changes</h2> <p>The new app, so far, was mostly the same as the old version but without the <code>AppDelegate.swift</code> or <code>SceneDelegate.swift</code> files (using the new XCode 12 multiplatform app template). I also combined the Core Data <code>FloatingTask</code> and <code>DailyTask</code> entities into one <code>Task</code> entity. By this point, everything was running well enough so I started to migrate more code into the new codebase starting with the fetch request:</p> <pre><code>@FetchRequest(
    entity: Task.entity(),
    sortDescriptors: [
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Task.completed, ascending: true),
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Task.priority, ascending: false),
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Task.name, ascending: true)
    ]
) var tasks: FetchedResults&lt;Task&gt;</code></pre> <h2 id="-breaking-taskview">## Breaking TaskView</h2> <p>Tasks are displayed as <code>TaskView</code>s in a <code>ForEach</code> loop on the homescreen, which is simple enough. The <code>TaskView</code> struct, however, is relatively complicated. The purpose of <code>TaskView</code> is to represent and manipulate a single <code>Task</code>. In the previous version of the app (I'm going to call the original version 2.0 and the rewrite 3.0 from now on), this involved passing a number of attributes individually to be manipulated as the view's <code>@State</code>. When migrating the view, I reduced this to a single <code>@ObservedObject</code>. I also removed some of the text styling, which I planned to port over after I got the UI functional.</p> <p>I ran the app on my device, and this happened:</p> <p><video controls="" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/ascending-checkmarks-error.webm"><a href="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/ascending-checkmarks-error.webm">As you check off any task in the vertical stack, instead of checking off the task that you selected, tasks are checked off starting from the bottom and moving upwards in an ascending order.</a></video></p> <p>Well that was unexpected. Instead of checking off the tasks I selected, tasks were checked off starting from the bottom and ascending – obviously not the intended behavior! My first thought was that it was caused by the use of <code>@ObservedObject</code> to declare the view's task property –&nbsp;I haven't seen it used to manipulate a Core Data entity before, but it's worked fine so far in txtodo – so I rewrote the variables to match version 2.0.</p> <p><img alt="The variables declared before the UI of version 3.0 and version 2.0. Version 3.0 has two variables, task and config, but version 2.0 has nine: task, completed, name, priority, deleted, editingText, editingPriority, viewingNotes, and confirmingDelete." src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/variable-comparison.webp"></p> <p>Still no change. It was getting pretty late at this point, but I decided to stick it out for just a bit longer. I rewrote the <code>TaskView</code> struct from scratch <em>two more times</em> to no avail. Something was wrong, but I had no idea where it was and there was no way I was going to figure it out at two in the morning by coding it again the exact same way.</p> <h2 id="-fantastic-bugs-and-where-to-find-them">## Fantastic Bugs and Where to Find Them</h2> <p>The next morning, I took a look at the code again. If the problem wasn't in <code>TaskView</code>, where was it? The only other thing in the UI was the button to make a new task, which looked something like this:</p> <pre><code>Button(action: {
    let newTask = Task(context: self.managedObjectContext)
    newTask.name = "test"
    newTask.priority = 3
    newTask.notes = [String]() as NSObject
    newTask.id = UUID()
    newTask.date = Date.init()
    newTask.daily = true
    do {
        try self.managedObjectContext.save()
    } catch {
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}) {
    Text("Add")
}</code></pre> <p>Some of you may have figured it out by this point. At the time, I was still confused – this was the exact method I was using in my previous app, but with preset values – how could it be broken? I modified the generation slightly so I could tell the difference between tasks, and hopefully get to the bottom of the issue:</p> <pre><code>let newTask = Task(context: self.managedObjectContext)
newTask.name = String(UUID().uuidString.prefix(Int.random(in: 5..&lt;9)))
newTask.priority = Int16.random(in: 1..&lt;4)
newTask.notes = [String]() as NSObject
newTask.id = UUID()
newTask.date = Date.init()
newTask.daily = Bool.random()</code></pre> <p>I ran the app again and saw this:</p> <p><video controls="" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/randomized-test-values.webm"><a href="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/randomized-test-values.webm">The tasks were not being marked off in ascending order – rather, they were being moved to the bottom when completed, which I couldn't tell before because they were all identical.</a></video></p> <h2 id="-intentional-behavior">## Intentional Behavior</h2> <p>The tasks weren't being marked off in ascending order. They were being moved to the bottom automatically when marked as complete, which I couldn't see because a) all the tasks were identical and b) there were no animations to indicate that was happening. They were sorted by the <code>FetchRequest</code> with a <code>NSSortDescriptor</code>, to make sure that the unfinished tasks are the first thing the user sees. The "glitch" I had spent two days chasing down was entirely by design, and I had just forgotten.</p> <p>There were two main things I learned from this experience. First, it's incredibly important to be able to take breaks. The difference between spending two days trying to fix a non-existent glitch and realizing it's a feature you implemented could be as simple as a nap – it was for me. Secondly, your test and placeholder data is more significant than you might think: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in%2C_garbage_out" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">garbage in, garbage out</a> definitely applies here. If all your test data is the same, your tests are not good tests.</p> <h2 id="-wrap-up">## Wrap-up</h2> <p>To make the sorting more clear, I randomized the tasks' priority, name, and category (as seen above) and added an animation with <code>.animation(.easeIn(duration: 0.25))</code>. The current prototype looks something like this:</p> <p><video controls="" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/update-preview.webm"><a href="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/update-preview.webm">Animated, randomized tasks being checked off, deleted, and delayed.</a></video></p> <p>This has been a really fun blog post to write! A got a big laugh out of this bug chase, and I hope you've enjoyed reading it.</p> <p>Till next time, FIGBERT</p> </section></article></div>]]>

After six months and 50,000 lines of DragonRuby Runtime enhancements,&nbsp;Ryan and Amir now have a live/hot loadable, cruft-free, productive game engine&nbsp;that can target... well... any gaming device you can think of.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>
This is all you need to create a game. One file. One method called <code>tick</code>. Here we render the&nbsp;current step value as a label: </p>
<pre>def tick args
  args.outputs.labels &lt;&lt; [100, 100, args.state.tick_count]
end
</pre>
<p>
That's it. If you know how to use the <code>array</code> datatype in <em>any</em> language, you know how to use the DragonRuby Game Toolkit. <a href="http://fiddle.dragonruby.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Here's the proof right here, play around with the engine&nbsp;in your browser.</strong></a></p>

<p>Here are the six draw primitives you need to know: <code>solids, sprites, labels, lines, borders, and sounds</code>. Here is how you use them:</p>
<pre>def tick args  
  # draw a blue square that's half way faded out
  args.outputs.solids &lt;&lt; [100, 100, 50, 50, 0, 0, 255, 128]
  
  # draw a red label  
  args.outputs.labels &lt;&lt; [100, 100, "This is a label.", 255, 0, 0]
  
  # draw a sprite turned 45 degrees and half way faded out
  args.outputs.sprites &lt;&lt; [200, 200, 50, 50, 'ninja.png', 45, 128]
  
  # draw a diagonal green line from bottom left to top right
  args.outputs.lines &lt;&lt; [0, 0, 1280, 720, 0, 255, 0]
  
  # draw a black border (unfilled square)
  args.outputs.borders &lt;&lt; [100, 100, 50, 50, 0, 0, 0, 255]
  
  # play a sound every second
  args.outputs.sounds &lt;&lt; "ping.wav" if args.state.tick_count % 60 == 0
end</pre>
<p>That's it. You now know the entire render api for DragonRuby GTK.</p>
<p>
Here's a more complicated example.&nbsp;This is how you create a night time scene, with a title, and a ninja:</p>
<ol><li><code>solids</code>: A black background, and two hundred stars made of tiny squares.</li><li><code>labels</code>: Display some smokey-white text.</li><li><code>sounds</code>: Play a sound when the game starts up.</li><li><code>sprites</code>: Render a sprite on the screen.</li><li><code>lines</code>: Draw a line representing the floor</li><li><code>borders</code>: Frame the entire scene&nbsp;with a white border.</li></ol>
<pre>def tick args
  # destructure args into local variables
  state, outputs, grid = args.state, args.outputs, args.grid
  # set some default values for the game
  state.colors.background ||= [0, 0, 0]
  state.colors.star       ||= [128, 200, 255]
  state.colors.text       ||= [200, 200, 200]
  state.colors.landmarks  ||= [255, 255, 255]
  state.night             ||= [grid.rect, state.colors.background]
  state.stars             ||= 200.map do
    [rand * grid.w,
     rand * grid.h,
     rand * 2 + 2,
     rand * 2 + 2,
     state.colors.star]
  end
  # start up some background music
  outputs.sounds  &lt;&lt; "opening_fx.wav" if state.tick_count == 0
  # render the background and stars
  outputs.solids  &lt;&lt; state.night
  outputs.solids  &lt;&lt; state.stars
  # set a title for the game
  outputs.labels  &lt;&lt; [grid.left + 50, grid.top  - 50, 
                      "Ninja Game", state.colors.text]
  # set a sprite
  outputs.sprites &lt;&lt; [50, 50, 50, 50, 'ninja.png']
  # create a line that represents the ground
  outputs.lines   &lt;&lt; [grid.left, 
                      grid.bottom + 50, 
                      grid.right, 
                      grid.bottom + 50, 
                      state.colors.landmarks]
  # create a border to frame the game
  outputs.borders &lt;&lt; [grid.left + 1,
                      grid.bottom + 1, 
                      grid.right - 1, 
                      grid.top - 1, 
                      state.colors.landmarks]
end</pre>

<p>This is how you move a sprite using your gamepad:<br></p>
<pre>args.state.ninja.x ||= 100
args.outputs.sprites &lt;&lt; [args.state.ninja.x, 300,
                         50, 50,
                         'ninja.png']
if args.inputs.controller_one.key_held.right
  args.state.ninja.x += 10
elsif args.inputs.controller_one.key_held.left
  args.state.ninja.x -= 10
end
</pre>
<p>This is how you move a sprite using your mouse:<br></p>
<pre>args.state.ninja.x ||= 100
args.outputs.sprites &lt;&lt; [
   args.state.ninja.x, 
   300, 
   50, 
   50, 
   'ninja.png'
]
if args.inputs.mouse.click  
  args.state.ninja.x = args.inputs.mouse.click.point.x
end</pre>
<p>This is how you move a sprite using your keyboard:</p>
<pre>args.state.ninja.x ||= 100
args.outputs.sprites &lt;&lt; [args.state.ninja.x, 300, 50, 50, 
                         'ninja.png']
if args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.right
  args.state.ninja.x += 10
elsif args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.left
  args.state.ninja.x -= 10
end</pre>

<p>
Randomly create 500&nbsp;ninjas on the screen. Create a lookup table that contains the alpha property of ninjas that have collided. Present all ninjas with their alpha properties set.</p>
<pre>def tick args
  # destructure args into local variables
  grid, state, outputs = args.grid, args.state, args.outputs
  
  # use Game Toolkit's built in helper methods to create
  # adhoc entities
  state.ninjas ||= 500.map do
    state.new_entity(:ninja,
                    { rect: [grid.w.-(50) * rand,
                             grid.h.-(50) * rand,
                             50,
                             50] })
  end
  # use Ruby's powerful apis to determine collision
  state.collisions ||= state.ninja
                            .product
                            .reject { |n, n2| n == n2 }
                            .find_all { |n, n2| n.rect.intersects_rect?(n2.rect) }
                            .map { |n, _| [n.entity_id, 128] }
                            .pairs_to_hash
  #render everything to the screen
  outputs.sprites &lt;&lt; state.ninjas.map do |n|
    [n.rect, 'dragonruby.png', 0,
     state.collisions[n.entity_id] || 255]
  end
end</pre>

		<p>Audio brings games and projects to life! Web developers have it easy, they can publish their apps on the web and play audio using the browser API no problem. However, what about those of us that are command-line and graphics apps in other languages? Repl.it is a special place on the web where you can publish any app in any language, but so far it’s been missing audio capabilities because code executes in a container on the backend. This summer, for my internship I set out to solve this problem and make it possible to play audio in any repl in any language. In this post I’ll show you how to play audio in your repl and then I will chronicle the journey that got us here. </p>
<p><img src="https://repl.art/music-01.png" alt="music art"></p>
<h2 id="how-you-play-audio">How you play audio</h2>
<p>Before we get to the technical parts, let's talk about how you can use audio in your app or game.</p>
<p>As of this writing we support two libraries: Python and JavaScript. The Python library is built right in so you shouldn't need to install it. However, the JavaScript library you'll have to install and you can do that by simple importing (<code>@replit/audio</code>).</p>
<p>You can learn more on our <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/audio">docs for audio</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a quick demo before I tell how it all works:</p>


<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>It started out with an idea, I wanted to add audio to Repl.it because I wanted to use it and many users were asking for it, so it seemed like a good project to take on.  To be honest, I thought it was going to be a lot easier than it turned out to be. I thought I’d just throw in a Pulseaudio stream over TCP, play it in the browser, and be done with it. I was wrong. But who would’ve thought that real-time audio streaming from an isolated Docker container using fake audio devices without the use of an always-on daemon would be difficult? I sure didn’t.</p>
<p>At first, my goal was to get something simple that worked. My first attempt was to use a combination of portaudio and loopback devices native to the host machine but isolated to each container but that didn’t end up working because the infrastructure was far too complicated to be maintainable and we’d have to install C libraries for each language so they could play audio. Moving on.</p>
<p>My second attempt was to prototype something so I could see how I could build the client. I wanted to make sure that I had at least one part of the setup correct.  For this attempt, I just searched for files named “PlayMeAudio.wav (or .aiff)” which would be decoded and sent to the client in a buffer when the client opened the repl. Although this worked, it was only a prototype and we didn’t ship it.</p>
<p>For my third attempt, I figured I’d decode the audio and relay that to the client via a pipe file. Although this worked, it was using a ridiculous amount of CPU in Python and just simply not fast enough. I had concerns it might be an issue in other languages as well.</p>
<p>For my final and fourth attempt, I made a request based system. Instead of decoding the audio files in userland and putting a strain on resources, I’d have the user language tell me which files to play, and we’d do the heavy lifting in Go, which is the language that we write the container service in, which we call PID1.  Although the code was a mess, it worked and ended up being the first version of audio we released to explorers, despite its many shortcomings.</p>
<p>Although it worked, this attempt had three issues: 
All files had to be at a sample rate of <code>44,000</code> hertz
All files had to have a bit depth of <code>32</code>
Only <code>.aiff</code> and <code>.wav</code> files were supported.</p>
<p>The reason for the first issue was that I couldn't find a good polyphase filter (for sample rate conversion) and I needed a C library to cross compile. This proved to be challenging, as we needed to static link it and it had libm as a dependency, which means we’d have to static link all of libc -- more on that later.  I ended up having to dynamically build it. Including its source wasn't an option because it had very large generated files, so I had to build it before we built PID1, more on this later on.</p>
<p>For the second issue, I really didn’t have an excuse other than not really understanding bit depth, but once I did I was able to quickly fix it.</p>
<p>For the third one, it wasn't so much that those files were the only ones supported - it was more so that we didn’t support <code>.mp3</code> files- for this, I ended up needing to use C again. I used minimp3 library and its Go bindings.</p>
<p>I also had plans to include <code>.opus</code> file support, so I was going to need another C library… Well to clarify, I needed both opus and opusfile. Opusfile requires opus, which requires OpenSSL, so I had to build OpenSSL the build opus and opusfile, without root. Well needless to say, this was starting to get a bit ridiculous to do more than once. I made a <a href="https://github.com/repl-it-discord/audio/">github repo</a> which would serve as a repo to house all the C libraries we needed along with the Go bindings, and I included a file I found from a source that would let me static link libm without all of libc. </p>
<p>After all of this, we have the dependencies resolved, and everything sounds good - except for one thing: Changes in audio take <code>~.74</code> -  <code>~1.48</code> seconds to take effect. Why? Well we were sending audio in chunks, instead of streaming. Every <code>~.74</code> seconds, we prepare audio and send exactly <code>32,768</code> samples (<code>2^15</code>, no particular reason for this magic number other than the buffer rarely runs out and the latency isn't unbearable) but this wasn't enough.  </p>
<p>The client was designed to append audio samples at the end of what it had scheduled, so what I did was send audio initially and then immediately send it again, so we’d give the client  <code>65,536</code> samples at the start, and send an additional <code>32,768</code> samples every <code>~.74</code> seconds. Where did I get <code>.74</code> seconds from? As we are playing the audio at <code>44,100</code> hertz, we play <code>44,100</code> samples per second - so <code>32,768/44,100</code>. </p>
<p>This setup was great for smooth audio, but I felt that the latency makes your repl experience feel rather shoddy. I mean, imagine you’re playing a game, you open the chest and go through a door. Once you go through the door, the sound from the chests plays because you as a user have that <code>.74</code> - <code>1.48</code> second buffer, which just makes using audio for games useless for anything other than background music.</p>
<p>So we had to rewrite this and unfortunately to solve the timing issue we had to complicate the solution. We made the server send overlapping buffers of samples and the client used a timing system along with a sample index the server sent to calculate and compensate for latency and try to make it “real-time” streaming.</p>
<p>Now I know this is hard to understand, in fact I was told it was also hard to code review, so I’ll do my best to illustrate it. </p>
<p>Normally, this is how our makeshift stream would look:</p>
<pre><code>Message 1: 1 2 3 4 5
Message 2:         5 6 7 8 9 
Message 3:                 9 10 11 12 13
...</code></pre><p>This keeps us from audio cutting out due to (network) latency (to an extent), allowing us for smaller buffer sizes without as much (audio) latency</p>
<p>That alone isn't very special, what's really the star of the show is for the server to be able to send:</p>
<pre><code>Message 1: 1 2 3 4 5  
Message 2:   2 3 4 5 6
Message 3:           6 7 8 9 10</code></pre><p>The client is where the difficult processing for this takes place, when we receive new samples we immediately stop playing and start playing those samples… well… mostly. </p>
<p>You see, there's still the one thing that we can’t control. Networking.  Maybe there's a <code>.1</code> second delay for one of the messages, well now look - we’re playing audio we already played!</p>
<p>So now the client has to calculate LATENCY too, which is even MORE difficult. At this point, we’re on multiple devices, and we need less than a <code>1/44,100</code> second difference in time in order to figure this out! That seemed too hard. Instead, what I did was give each message in the protocol the sample index of the first sample, i.e. the first message would have sample index <code>0</code>.  The client then determines how many samples the player has played in total and if that's greater than the sample index it will compensate for that by skipping samples. </p>
<p>Now too get back to the request system I mentioned earlier -- how does one use that? As I mentioned, there’s two libraries above for Python and JavaScript, however this should work for any language, and you’re free to implement your own libraries.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-libraries-work">How do libraries work?</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, users can determine what is played via requests to a named pipe which PID1 reads.  I opted for a simple approach for encoding - json. While making libraries is fun and all, I can’t update libraries for many languages every time I change the requests, so I figured I’d make the request system pretty simple.</p>
<p>The user’s script must only write json data to <code>/tmp/audio</code> (a named pipe) and the go script will then parse the data and fulfill the request.  However, this might error - for example the file isn't found or has invalid encoding. Since we’re sending requests through a named pipe, we can't get errors very easily.
This means that the library the client uses must determine when there’s an issue with a source being created - the setup I made for the libraries which I used would wait up to a set amount of time then if the source wasn’t created in time it times out - while this isn’t always perfect, it's better than nothing.</p>
<p>A typical request to play a tone might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"Paused"</span>: <span>false</span>,
  <span>"Name"</span>: <span>"My tone"</span>,
  <span>"Type"</span>: <span>"tone"</span>,
  <span>"Volume"</span>: <span>1</span>,
  <span>"DoesLoop"</span>: <span>false</span>,
  <span>"LoopCount"</span>: <span>0</span>,
  <span>"Args"</span>: {
    <span>"Pitch"</span>: <span>400</span>,
    <span>"Seconds"</span>: <span>5</span>,
    <span>"Type"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"Path"</span>: <span>""</span>
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>A quick explanation of the above fields: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>Paused</code> - Whether the source is paused or not - this can only be set when updating the source.</li>
<li><code>Name</code> - the name of the source - this can be used to identify the source when it's being created - if it's not set the name will be set by pid1.</li>
<li><code>Type</code> - the type of the source, supported types when I wrote this are:<ul>
<li><code>wav</code> - A <code>.wav</code> file</li>
<li><code>aiff</code> - A <code>.aiff</code> file </li>
<li><code>mp3</code> - A <code>.mp3</code> file</li>
<li><code>tone</code> - A generated tone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Volume</code> - The volume of the source as a floating point number - <code>1</code> would be <code>100</code>%</li>
<li><code>DoesLoop</code> - Whether the source should loop or not …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div><h2 id="8f96">Project Management</h2><h2 id="6dc1">What problems can arise and how to avoid them</h2><div><div><div><div><a href="https://blog.maddevs.io/@tamaramun?source=post_page-----49948f783756----------------------" rel="noopener"><div><p><img alt="Tamara Mun" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*kYv_s7Yqw5w34iwqYxKzww.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></p></div></a></div></div></div></div><p id="4c2c">Feature acceptance by the client is one of the important phases in the project’s life cycle, which ultimately determines the product’s functionality delivered to the end-users. The whole point of this step is to successfully sign off the feature with the client and make the release, but to achieve it you have to make sure that all the objectives are met. Sometimes not everything goes so smoothly. It often happens when just before the deadline you discover that some functions are acting up or stop working at all. As a result, you get stressed teams and unsatisfied clients. Let’s work out why these problems occur and the ways you can ensure stressful-free feature completion.</p><p id="daaa">One of the most frequent problems is when teams <strong>do not think through feature requirements</strong>.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Two yellow robots opposite board." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2734/0*S1fMRKsH_35nUCld" width="1367" height="912" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*S1fMRKsH_35nUCld 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*S1fMRKsH_35nUCld 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*S1fMRKsH_35nUCld?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="90eb">For example, you implemented a feature for the web page, however, you did not think it through and forgot to adjust it for the mobile version, which results in a jagged page layout or faulty feature. Or you developed a customer service feature for end-users but did not consider adding a control panel for admin staff. Such small things, which can easily slip your mind will have a big impact on the quality of the user experience.</p><p id="98f3">The previous issue can be avoided by focusing on creating a high-quality and comprehensive plan in the early stages, which will help you and your team to avoid any last-minute hustles.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Two girls communicating." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1824/0*L6Vb1fPH7ZwCex3t" width="912" height="912" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*L6Vb1fPH7ZwCex3t 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*L6Vb1fPH7ZwCex3t 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*L6Vb1fPH7ZwCex3t?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="ad23">The main objective of feature planning lies in determining the value it will deliver to a user; however, it also includes in itself everything from function capabilities and to the way it will look like. When you are working on big projects, it is essential for a team to carefully consider each feature from<strong> the perspectives of different users</strong> as it is greatly affecting the characteristics it should deliver. It is also important to organize enough testing before the project completion, to identify any defects in the early stages.</p><p id="b307">Another common problem is when<strong> clients' wishes are being misread</strong> and it is usually a product of poor communication. It happens that at the planning stage technical team misunderstands the client’s needs and as a result, the final product is not meeting their expectations.</p><p id="0182">Sometimes both parties are the ones to blame. For example, the client has given a vague presentation of their idea, while developers did not clarify confusing parts and proceeded to an execution stage. Nevertheless, I believe that we should encourage a customer to be more open and give us the bigger and more detailed picture, especially if he/she is not really tech-savvy and can have a difficult time trying to explain something out of their expertise. It is more sensible to ensure that all the time and effort you are about to put in this project is not going to be put to waste and met with disapproval in the end.</p><p id="4498">Afterward no matter if the idea was coming from the main stakeholder or product manager and despite how good it may sound; it has to go through a feature validation process. Essentially it will help to make sure it solves the right problems, fits the needs of your target audience, and has a potential for future business success. Only then you can proceed to the implementation stage. It is more sensible to ensure that all the time and effort the team is about to put in this project is not going to be put to waste for an idea that was bound to fail from the beginning.</p><p id="cb73">Making sure that your client is actively engaged in the project should be the top priority for the whole team.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Man thinks." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1824/0*w229I5OLXD7ltkxY" width="912" height="912" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*w229I5OLXD7ltkxY 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*w229I5OLXD7ltkxY 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*w229I5OLXD7ltkxY?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="432c">It’s important to show the customer the progress of your work, making sure he/she sees what they are paying for and having a say in the process of development. Ensuring these aspects might save you from future troubles, such as when the client is not keeping track of the work and by the end is not satisfied with the outcome. These can be avoided by establishing a timetable for check-ups, it can be once in 1–2 months basically whatever will be fitting with your team’s pace. I find that it works better when such regular check-ups are more about visuals and testing the website or app itself, rather than looking at pure statistics and reports. It’s also great when a technical team doesn’t fully rely on the project manager but is ready to present the progress by themselves. It positively impacts both clients and teams involvement.</p><p id="e898">If you will be able to provide the client with regular review of the project, I can assure you that they will be more excited about the final product as the process will keep them more invested and curious.</p><p id="a871">Piling up the stack of work until the last minutes before the deadline. We all love it, don’t we? Yes, it might have worked with your school assignments and you were even getting A’s, but these habits should be better forgotten in the university days.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Woman boring." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2734/0*FL0fvCiqYJWxlonG" width="1367" height="912" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*FL0fvCiqYJWxlonG 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*FL0fvCiqYJWxlonG 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*FL0fvCiqYJWxlonG?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="9132">You have to remember that in a business environment, your mistakes are not solely affecting you, but your inconsiderate actions will cost the whole company money and spoiled reputation. In such cases, when you start hurriedly finishing your tasks in consequence you end up with a raw and incomplete product.</p><p id="a841">Putting on your plate more than you can handle. It is common for a team to dive into the task solving without doing proper scheduling ahead. Whether it is feature planning or any other stage, before actually starting to work on something you have to take a step back and analyse your future steps. What you should do is break one big task in smaller subdivisions. Firstly, it helps with an accurate estimation of the time and setting realistic deadlines.</p><p id="e5d0">Secondly, if you look at the problem as one big and endless bundle of tasks you tend to overcomplicate the difficulty level. So, sub-tasking also brings you a better understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. Moreover, it will bring more clarity to the client of the work you are doing and deeper insight into the progress you make.</p><p id="01d8">A good and professional project manager or a developer won’t put up with any uncertainties and missed deadlines. If you don’t want to cause unnecessary stress in the future implementation stage, then you better not overlook the sub-tasking point.</p><p id="fc6c">Finally, you will face different kinds of problems at each stage of the project. But your job is to minimize the number of such encounters to the best of your ability. As we saw in the listed above examples planning is key. Whether it is for something more specific like features planning or more generic concerning the organization of the whole project. Ensuring that you have a comprehensive plan which will come handy to every member of the group is very important, i.e. it will help your co-workers to stay on track and meet all the deadlines.</p><p id="d13a">Apart from that, you should not forget to communicate with your client, the main stakeholder of the project. By listening to your customer’s enquiries and providing them with a regular overview of the work you will be able to address any arising misunderstandings on time. Without driving them to the last minute and providing your team will end up with unnecessary headache and stress.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

Planning orchestrates the work of different project departments (<a href="https://maddevs.io/services?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=task-estimation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software development</a>, marketing, sales, etc.). Having a plan enables business decision-makers to stay focused on where they go and see the vector of product development clearly. Planning cannot work without estimating the time of execution for each of your tasks. Developing a habit of splitting your tasks into subtasks while defining the estimated time of execution for all of them is not easy. This sin can be common not only with Junior developers but more experienced professionals can also avoid estimates.</p><p id="2cc2">In this article, I’ll explain how we encourage our developers to estimate tasks using simple &amp; smart Jira configuration.</p><h2 id="5b9a"><strong>Where the problem originates from?</strong></h2><p id="e435">To quickly start a new project in JIRA, our PMs often use the default settings for workflow, fields, screens, etc. These settings are a good fit for a broad variety of projects, which is excellent! However, if you have a more specific task to complete, you’ll need to go deeper into configurations, like in our example. You will have to learn something new, too.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="The Default Workflow and the Advanced Workflow Configured in Jira for One of Mad Devs Projects." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3000/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png" width="1500" height="844" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The default workflow and the advanced workflow configured for one of our projects.</figcaption></figure><p id="0015">At the sprint planning stage, our PMs ask developers to fracture and estimate their tasks. This enables us not to overload the sprint and stay committed to what we can deliver on time. However, at times a developer may drill into an unestimated task which may let the entire team down. This person may be unaware of the full scope of work that he or she needs to do. This is the reason behind such actions.</p><blockquote><p id="ada6">The developer’s estimate is their personal commitment to complete the task on time.</p></blockquote><p id="38d3">The manager can surely control estimates manually by checking out every ticket, but this is not what we really want. We need to save time. A project manager can automate their routine tasks by picking the existing tool or even creating one from scratch. This principle is driving the entire IT industry forward.</p><p id="2a30">Now let’s have a look at the simple and elegant solution to the problem with the tasks estimating.</p><h2 id="728e"><strong>JIRA can do more than you think</strong></h2><p id="b59e">To solve the problem, I needed to make developers fill the <strong>Original Estimate</strong> field before they start working on a task (this is important). I’ve been working with JIRA for over a year now. Thanks to the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlassian University</a> courses I took, I came up with a solution fast. I assigned a task in JIRA to myself and started as follows:</p><p id="11c7"><strong>Prevent developers from moving an issue to the <em>In Progress</em> status until the issue has Original Estimate field filled</strong></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3998/1*-d1B6G45hH3hYYwHlqVAIQ.png" width="1999" height="1137" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*-d1B6G45hH3hYYwHlqVAIQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*-d1B6G45hH3hYYwHlqVAIQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*-d1B6G45hH3hYYwHlqVAIQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-d1B6G45hH3hYYwHlqVAIQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*-d1B6G45hH3hYYwHlqVAIQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="339c">By default, JIRA allows you to start working on a task freely, without providing an estimate. So let’s fix this!</p><p id="438c"><strong>Step one. </strong>Go to the workflow of your project and find the <em>transition</em> from <strong>To Do</strong> to the <strong>In Progress</strong> status.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="The transition from To Do to the In Progress Status in Jira Software." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3388/1*osq5d4VeVCsXfAwhn5Y8_g.png" width="1694" height="930" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*osq5d4VeVCsXfAwhn5Y8_g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*osq5d4VeVCsXfAwhn5Y8_g.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*osq5d4VeVCsXfAwhn5Y8_g.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*osq5d4VeVCsXfAwhn5Y8_g.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*osq5d4VeVCsXfAwhn5Y8_g.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The transition from <strong>To Do</strong> to the <strong>In Progress</strong> status in Jira Software</figcaption></figure><p id="bffc"><strong>Step two. </strong>Add validation to the <strong>Original Estimate</strong> in the <strong>Field Required Validator</strong>.

Now no one on your team is able to start working on a task that hasn’t been estimated. (Bear in mind that this configuration applies to<em> all</em> tasks going through the transition <strong>To Do</strong><em> →</em><strong><em> </em>In Progress</strong>. If you need to set up the estimation required for certain <em>issuetypes</em>, you will need to set additional steps in <strong>Conditions</strong>).</p><h2 id="8361"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p id="9989">This simple &amp; smart configuration will help you as a manager to always see how long all tasks take to be completed. Such a condition makes your developers think about the number of tasks taken into work. The estimation process is automated with zero micromanagement!</p><p id="666c">Do you want to know about Project Management more?</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>‍<strong>Here’s the one(ish)-sentence summary: </strong>we took a goofy idea with some crummy designs made in Google Slides and ended up contract manufacturing custom bobblehead trophies. We send these trophies to every team that subscribes to Water Cooler Trivia. <br></p><h2><strong>How it all began</strong><br></h2><p>In January 2019, our team met to talk goals for the upcoming year. We had laid the foundations for a product that brings work teams closer together and builds office culture, and we wanted to keep improving the product and bringing it to more teams.<br></p><p>One of our goals: <strong>Delight users through new customer-centric innovations. </strong>We’re a platform for customizable weekly trivia quizzes. The quizzes and results are sent via email or Slack. Naturally, most of our “customer-centric innovations” are software based, like redesigning our <a href="https://app.watercoolertrivia.com/demo/results">quiz results</a> or building a<a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/features-slack-app"> Slack app</a>.<br></p><p>However, with only a single-person engineering department, we couldn’t bite off much more than one big feature each quarter.&nbsp;So we started thinking about a customer-centric feature that didn’t require a single line of code: <strong>a Water Cooler Trivia bobblehead trophy.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f23668c73efdd4882767e82_IMG_0918.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Yes, those are the trophies posed in my kitchen.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From idea to design</strong></h2><p>Back in 2019, there was a little old institution known as the office. This is where coworkers would spend much of their waking week, working in non-socially-distant proximity.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This is also where teams would discuss the weekly Water Cooler Trivia results. The winner is celebrated in the results email each week, but that fleeting sense of accomplishment, well, fleets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We wanted to create a new way to celebrate the winner. Stealing the idea of a roaming championship totem like the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stanley+cup+filled+with+skittles&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS879US879&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01N4_N6R1iLOS5J_sNWKjo3ynVPPA:1596144974172&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTy8ex9_XqAhXKQc0KHdcjBx0Q_AUoAXoECA4QAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=749">Stanley Cup</a> or a WWE belt, we wanted to send a trophy to each team. <strong>The winner would proudly display the trophy on their desk for the duration of their reign</strong> -- typically one week but longer if they had back-to-back victories.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Rather than imitation-chrome over a faceless figurine like the soccer participation trophies of our past, we wanted <strong>a trophy that reflected the quirky, fun tone of Water Cooler Trivia</strong>. After all, the goal here is team-building fun, so the trophy might as well be fun.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f23602980e22bd77a756d05_Group%2050%20(2).png" alt=""></p><figcaption>There's enough of these faux-metallic-finished trophies in the world.</figcaption></figure><p>What’s more fun than a trophy? A bobblehead. What’s more fun than a faceless gold figurine? Our “blue brain” mascot.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f23609fc91bd60af1a7d087_collage%201.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>We love the brains.</figcaption></figure><p>I had a clear vision in my head of what these trophies would look like, but no design skills or manufacturing experience. <strong>My design toolkit? Google Slides.</strong> It’s free, super easy to share, and it has a crop button.<br></p><p>I searched for a few inspiration images: <strong>blue brains</strong>, <strong>water cooler renderings</strong>, and <strong>brain trophies</strong>. The results were pretty much exactly what you would expect.&nbsp;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f3f49ec631774ca9422_hl75CU-kzTBo4_7r8jgUb2N8qc0Qw5isQu2pzmqlcHxo3zsOE7ge9pZJZ8GPuOOSho4quQe03VPjzZU8NMiNZxjrByIc5GMmJqLP99lFup3xD7WJ1pyreymPrxgyUYH4isDsRLbO.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Design building blocks via Google Images.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, I played with a few iterations of what this trophy might look like by overlaying text blocks and smashing two images together. <strong>These looked bad.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f3fa79a46074dcddffa_Gu4Z_2uchCr5yiSgMknGu-nYorXoS3MiytTGaoHUpEoE1cnIwZhNa7fKO_beOtjIa6kVTBx4Fllbdp_SVW9YNRVpkx7HY9ve5UmbZzDd7qqbae7FjngA2yYyXaMGakAalD5ALlLA.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>First attempts at a trophy design.</figcaption></figure><p>So I iterated a few more times. I noodled with the concept of putting the brain in a water cooler (basically a 3D version of our boringly 2D logo).&nbsp;I toggled the transparency and saturation, hoping that I would magically stumble upon a not-totally-horrible-looking combination. <br></p><p><strong>It turned out fine.</strong><br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f245e1f6d93f82c6667f72d_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%2012.08.20%20PM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>My final Google Slides design of the trophy.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From design to manufacturing partner</strong></h2><p>Quick aside: a friend of a friend owns a business that sells Bitcoin socks. You read that right: socks, not stocks. Black foot-and-lower-leg coverings dotted with yellow BTC logos. I was amazed that the design, manufacturing, and shipping were all through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba">Alibaba</a>, the Chinese conglomerate often compared to Amazon. </p><p>Critically, he clued me in to the fact that Alibaba has a super-accessible RFP (request for proposal) feature.</p><p><strong>You enter a description, an image, a quantity, and a price point. Within hours you are flooded with offers from manufacturers. </strong>This was extremely convenient. <br></p><p><strong>Five vendors reached out within 48 hours</strong> in various mixes of Chinese and English. I wasn’t quite sure how to decide, so I went with the vendor that was most responsive to my questions and had the most robust English.</p><p>Our contract manufacturer? <a href="https://xfdbobble.en.alibaba.com/">Xiamen Xinfade Trade Co</a> with Jonas from their team as our touchpoint throughout the process.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f245fb1dd15c16aa68b3ffc_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%2012.15.02%20PM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Dog Custom bobblehead was the closest category.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From manufacturing partner to bobblehead trophies</strong></h2><p>The email back-and-forth with Jonas began in earnest when I sent my “designs” (Google Slides screenshots) in March 2019.<br></p><p>We discussed project timing, and in less than two weeks he sent pictures of the mold.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f4041f47b7113ec4f25_HT8B54ZCk_wm8pWpAzzq5DaBl9ViC-JS4Y2cCE9xGvXP1pPbvsDqLgjaZe4QREMBi2A_OxtqCVx9F4uLdG-HUe0MoA_CQapNoGtoTHAWrzMKJCatr-u1Y2SUpAM7BDLOa9Dp_XGr.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>The mold of the trophy from different angles.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, we'd agreed to 300 trophies for $3.50 each, but we hadn't signed a contract or paid a single cent. So when Jonas sent through the mold images I was floored: <strong>this was actually happening.</strong><br></p><p>The molds looked good enough that we locked in the deal with a signed and paid invoice.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By April 11, Jonas sent me painted versions of the molds so we could get a sense of the colors. He asked about box details, colors, stickers, size, and more fine tuning.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f3f680645a36ea7f2ec_P7_uon-XtgJW6KHv4xzCgkMbcCvyQNsq4XhoDOVf-xOd5E-LQ3V_B1-wLxrfB-mGO8lNkupe5fl1CFZr57yhkRLx82KDDNDWlJdD6jW0vkF5Fieny-8CSTC9sP665J_gUOYBfAdP.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Painted versions of the mold. Still just a sticker version of the logo.</figcaption></figure><p>We asked for a lighter resin to make the cooler more transparent. Jonas made it happen. By mid-May, Jonas sent the picture of hundreds of bobbleheads coming off the assembly line. <strong>We were ecstatic.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f41e63c203678cfd7f0_lhd5l-_H4iikMusOv844lY3tWLENxFn5CyPE6mh8nrARa2XutbHet_-H356eKmkpMx9dd-lOQ9dz75iKCIalsrH4LX0QZkHak0WPmJqF9_BoYL95F6R_rHNFuFw8TJ9Kiqi5i9SQ.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Fresh off the assembly line.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From China to Brooklyn</strong></h2><p>Turns out shipping across an ocean with a small quantity of low-cost items is… expensive.<br></p><p>Jonas asked who our freight-forwarder was. We had no idea what he was talking about. He asked about our customs and import licenses. We were still clueless.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>We solved those boring logistics, but the cost was quickly escalating.</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>That initial quote of $3.50 per bobblehead trophy had risen to $4.00</li><li>There was $400 in setup fees</li><li>Another $150 surcharge because of our small order size</li><li>Freight was almost $750 to get them sent halfway around the world&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>Total price: $2,492 ($8.31 per trophy) </strong>to turn my crummy design into boxes and boxes of bobbleheads.<br></p><p>One small issue: that price only got the trophies to us. We would still need to mail out each one individually to each customer, adding another $3-6 per trophy.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f24616d27b61804384eaefd_Group%2059.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Money fleeing our pockets.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Tearing them down to build them up again</strong></h2><p>After an early July vacation, I returned to my fourth-floor walkup Brooklyn apartment with quite the surprise: 12 large, heavy boxes stacked neatly in the atrium. I didn't know how long the boxes had been there (I’d been out of town for over a week), but I was sure it'd confused my neighbors.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f40a79a463e49cddffb_jYbXUPrTvTKK3a8IJHNei2HidUvHJYD_Z60f33c0gfdzwNaSWQ7sg8yyO1Y0pXsjpVbSzZDzJHZh4nir8Kx2NtFKH8wGiS8e9bo70otXHOihTjPcrxdxQyQPk1rpzglmSXwLCQFj.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Much of the atrium was taken up with trivia trophy boxes.</figcaption></figure><p>With the help of two roommates, we carried the boxes up to our apartment. <strong>We unboxed the trophies, excited to see the outcome of the quixotic quest.</strong> They looked great! The brain was on a spring-loaded cylinder so it did indeed bobble, the transparency on the cooler allowed for easy observation of the richly-colored blue brain. It worked out better than I could have expected.&nbsp;</p><p>Except... </p><p>When I bobbled the bobblehead for a second time, the cooler separated from its circular base, sliding right off, and thusly <strong>decapitating the trophy.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The glue that attached the open cooler cylinder to the circular cardboard base was shoddy. As bobbleheads, we fully expected them to receive regular rattling.</p><p>I hoped I’d pulled a bad apple out of the barrel, but <strong>quality control checks on the next five trophies confirmed the problem was widespread.</strong> It was simply a weak point in the construction.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f3f0544bd5651c0cbd0_C25G_MkoXsmSSgJagtb83H09Y1nECSOFa20tDsF49FGMSo4PgeGyRKj9TCt3A5W5jtooAoiRwpUK2369TgnCLTH_qo9fQpX2GxbZhoVjxC5eTFo0upGfua3XHAYPNUWsoc-29wAI.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Actually there were two weak points.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The glue did not hold the resin and the cardboard together nearly enough for a trophy meant to bobble.</strong> After confirming the worst, we acknowledged that it was going to take serious elbow grease and human power to get the trophies in customer-ready shape.<br></p><p>Before undertaking the crafty project, we fixed a handful and took them on a quick photoshoot around New York City.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f423227a4684e5a1aa4_mAPl9kF4d7Y-7A8c00uxYUVjSlReiPVk0u-bPp1KLFY7XHcnUlD0EWfq-KYey7NfXRQYFkaJQQAbCXWTMkaFCy34NBTVmuNTe-nHiYnB5ijfyPIcN3kV3XBC7OfITeuT7RPMsEIH.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>We call it the "poor man's photoshoot."</figcaption></figure><p>The process of precisely breaking 300 bobbleheads and re-gluing them in two different places with Gorilla Glue is not a quick one. Especially when you add in the time of unboxing and re-boxing each individual trophy. My partner, my roommate, even my sister visiting New York all generously chipped in their time. <strong>In total, we spent about 30 hours fixing up the trophies.</strong><br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f40be075e716de512c6_szmo0tDw4evHQO38Am7oYvL3LxscMU9jQJYxsR3iH0PSxUxdYFfxnqOB5OSRUfaUmG6jU3W2vjAYdFoV8VW6J6mHZd99b9nwEVcT0vduh7slhZWiSMcCImIFMWlr41Hn5WJ6SDab.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f413227a489155a1aa3_4UNLDXSbdfeSvaO1Mn39bH51Stoov0wdxX-Ct3cyE2klQfOo_4ZsGFy6fwrEE_Fwa-F1JtRSdFT_igsbtnI5DJMQDiaALP418hApTCDbAO0Lz5Lt0MCsZyyQCgEax98ASz-o0AXJ.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f40e762e79eb6d96dfe_iv7bHadxbLn_BnrWBepDqLbbEorOsEjSgBH4FPX2c1hmxpq4WtjK5GfKQ1gbcbnr4Eion6apmH4heWraFTJBqSFd9-O2xmT4jTC_tSE-jphn_I0KBG1_amel7hP9hoUUnuf_aMP8.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>The real MVP.</figcaption></figure><p>Not exactly scintillating work, but we didn’t want to make it to the finish line only to send our customers a knowingly-busted object.</p><h2><strong>Lessons learned?</strong></h2><p><strong>Customers seem to genuinely like and appreciate the trophies.</strong> It gives our whimsical, fun-loving brand a more physical presence for hundreds of teams around the world.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f41d45976e1588c8c02_P37-ZeibsPwed0EDZpx_tgN41PuVZmSTffCrehHhU1u_eDKlYKaYjpH5xaXYasWMCypFZO5lJ4D7EnD8q5VbzEXFOeMMMAgHbr0r_MamQY3_Hoc3oFTYfsb44qYMw9BJuT_jn_cp.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Happy customers after a weekly trivia win.</figcaption></figure><p>We’re a pragmatic team here at Water Cooler Trivia HQ.

<p>It is one of the most commonly used supplements frequently taken to address joint pain, but there might be more to this dietary supplement than first meets the eye.</p>
<p>Glucosamine was originally discovered during the 1960s in Italy by pharmacologist Professor Luigi Rovati. Glucosamine is one of the most commonly used dietary supplements and is typically taken to help with the joint pain and inflammation associated with aging.</p>
<p>Glucosamine is a polysaccharide that is found naturally in cartilaginous joint tissues, bones, skin, ligaments, and nails, and it is involved in protein and lipid synthesis. In the context of joints, synovial fluid contains glucosamine and occupies the space between joints, helping to reduce the friction of joint surfaces.</p>
<p>Despite it being frequently taken for arthritis, the evidence for its effectiveness is limited, although, there is data for it being anti-inflammatory, as suggested by the results of a randomized clinical trial in 2015 [1].</p>
<p>However, glucosamine supplementation seems to correlate with lower all-cause mortality and other mortality risks, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, respiratory and digestive diseases. A recent <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/6/829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysis</a> published in the journal BMJ showed that glucosamine supplementation conveys around a 15% reduction of all-cause mortality [2]. This is a considerable amount when compared to other lifestyle interventions as well as other supplements. The data gathered is from a large number of people, and the trend of reduced mortality is unmistakable.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>This population-based prospective cohort study included 495 077 women and men (mean (SD) age, 56.6 (8.1) years) from the UK Biobank study. Participants were recruited from 2006 to 2010 and were followed up through 2018. We evaluated all-cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, respiratory and digestive disease. HRs and 95% CIs for all-cause and cause-specific mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for potential confounding variables.</p>
<p>Regular glucosamine supplementation was associated with lower mortality due to all causes, cancer, CVD, respiratory and digestive diseases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The exact reasons for this correlation with the reduction of various mortality risks is as yet unknown, but given the large patient group in this and in other analyses along with the popularity of this supplement, it is impossible to deny that there is a definite trend here.</p>
<p>We are not suggesting that you take this supplement, but given that it is cheap and freely available with an excellent safety profile, it may be worth your consideration and further research to evaluate if you wish to take it or not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="sapper"> <div>  <main> <div>  <h2 id="postSubtitle">and the Rise of Developer Discords</h2> <p>A few days ago <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1260929975454056449">I had a sudden realization</a>: I hadn't been active in Slack in the 2 months since <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/farewell-netlify/">I left Netlify</a>. Those of you who live and work in Slack know how big this is - I personally went from opening Slack practically <em>every day</em> from 2015 - 2020, to zero meaningful usage whatsoever.</p> <p>In its place, I am now active in a ton of Developer Discord channels. I feel like this is a <em>meaningful</em> shift this year, and based on responses, <a href="https://twitter.com/jkup/status/1260936175172419590?s=20">I'm</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/1Marc/status/1261960701666623488?s=20">not</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/stolinski/status/1260943494635352066?s=20">alone</a>.</p> <section> <h2 id="but-they-didnt-want-developers">But They Didn't Want Developers?</h2> <p>The obvious proximate cause of course, is that I am professionally and personally highly attuned to developer communities, and Slack has actively pushed away developer communities. <a href="https://twitter.com/harry_hedger/status/1261967137989513216?s=20">Quote Harry Hedger</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Slack lost <a href="https://www.reactiflux.com/">Reactiflux</a> bc they wanted $70k/month to support them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sure, I get that this was a deliberate decision. Storage costs money. But <em>how much</em> are we talking? Further, every company understands the logic of running "loss leaders" in order to seed stickiness and future growth. <strong>While literally every other company on Earth is throwing all sorts of free benefits to attract developers</strong>, Slack found developer communities growing like a weed on it, and flicked them away like so much dandruff. Stewart Butterfield is like the anti-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM-2OVNt-eQ">Ballmer</a>.</p> <p>I'm not here to argue that Slack lost developers because it didn't want developers. That's a tautology. I'm here to argue that <strong>this is a strategic fumble</strong> that opened up the field to whatever will eventually replace Slack for startups (Microsoft Teams' success is difficult to assess so I will ignore it here).</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="slack-losing-its-way">Slack Losing Its Way</h2> <p><strong>Developers are your canary in the coalmine</strong> for user experience - because they create the damn things!</p> <p>Slack's original appeal was that it had a much better user experience than prior work chat/email/collaboration tools including the now-dead HipChat and Campfire. Reams of VC pitch decks were made about the "Consumerization of the Workplace" thanks to Slack's approachable design (as <a href="https://medium.com/@awilkinson/slack-s-2-8-billion-dollar-secret-sauce-5c5ec7117908">MetaLab never fails to remind you</a>) and early touches like emoji reactions and bots. The theory was that we demand the UX polish that we see in our personal lives, in our professional lives as well.</p> <p>Fast forward to today: "I’ve been using Discord a ton lately. Slack for work and Discord for hobbies." That's from <a href="https://twitter.com/1Marc/status/1261960701666623488">Marc Grabanski</a>, who knows a thing or two about developer trends.</p> <p>I'll raise you another point: In 2016, Slack was originally backronym'ed into the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-did-slack-get-its-name-2016-9">Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge</a>.</p> <p>Fast forward to today and advice from the curiously high amount of "how to work from home" content you've undoubtedly been receiving is overwhelmingly <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/#2-communicate-asynchronously">Communicate Asynchronously</a> and <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1331-process-and-tools-how-to-collaborate-effectively-when-your-team-is-remote#but-are-there-tools-you-just-cant-live-without">Use Anything But Slack for Long Lived Knowledge</a>.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="the-game-is-changing">The Game is Changing</h2> <p>Meanwhile the UX bar has risen in the past 5 years:</p> <ul> <li>Slack makes you create a email and password anew every time you join a new Slack. Clicking a Discord invite immediately lands you in the channel as long as you're logged in.</li> <li>Slack walks you through the full onboarding experience every time you join a new Slack. I've joined probably 80 Slacks, I'm tired of the "👋 Hi, Slackbot here!" welcome messages on how to use Slack, or the downright <em>buggy</em> step through guide that prompts me to put in my profile picture even though Slack clearly figured out that I use the same damn picture every time and is already displaying it. Discord does exactly none of this.</li> <li>You need to repeat the whole email and signup song and dance when you move to your phone. Discord is cross-platform-first - sign in on desktop and you're also signed in on mobile.</li> <li>(Developer specific) The new WYSIWYG editor rolled out last year <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7nbn/slacks-new-rich-text-editor-shows-why-markdown-still-scares-people">made it annoying</a> for developers accustomed to What We Type Is What We Get Thank You Very Much. Not only does Discord not get in the way of your typing, it offers <strong>SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING</strong> if you add <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting">language identifiers</a> to your code fenced blocks!</li> </ul> <p>The past year or so in Office Productivity has been a free-for-all as other companies moved into Slack's open flanks. Notion has torn it up as the Searchable Knowledge Base to beat today. Zoom has overwhelmingly captured video chat, despite Slack also offering it natively. Even a bootstrapped startup like <a href="http://tuple.app/">Tuple</a> has become successful despite Slack buying the literal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/slack-buys-screenhero-to-add-screen-sharing-and-voice-chat-to-its-work-messaging-platform/">category maker</a> in the space. And of course Discord and even Telegram have made inroads in real time chat.</p> <p>My intuition is that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/">the Great Unbundling</a> has come for Slack. Whether or not it survives will probably depend on this: Is text chat really <a href="https://jtbd.info/feature-vs-product-42bf2dad2764">a feature or a product</a>? Either way, having to answer that question is an undesirable strategic position for Slack to be in. There is no victory in this fight.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: if you feel lost right about here, I released the <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/dev-guide-to-tech-strategy/">Developer's Guide to Tech Strategy</a> chapter of <a href="https://twitter.com/coding_career">my upcoming book</a> recently, feel free to pause and check it out.</p> </blockquote> </section> <section> <h2 id="not-over-yet">Not Over Yet</h2> <p>Slack has fumbled a ball, but it still has a strong lead. Two features still make Slack a strong fit for realtime workplace communication: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14305528/slack-threads-threaded-messages">threaded messages</a>, which Discord refuses to build, and <a href="https://slackhq.com/shared-channels-growth-innovation">Shared Channels</a>, which <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1096347638696267778?s=20">I've gone on record</a> as saying will add years' worth and billions of dollars of revenue. Both were introduced in 2017, probably the peak year of innovation for Slack before creating <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=slack+fund&amp;oq=slack+fund&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57l2j69i59l2j69i65l2j69i61j69i60.843j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">the Slack fund</a> in 2018 and then its 2019 IPO.</p> <p>From my limited anecdata, the no-code <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/24/slack-launches-workflow-builder-for-businesses-to-make-apps-without-code/">Workflow Builder</a> hasn't yet had significant adoption, but I would be happy to see this change over time. All great platforms eventually add low/no-code automation.</p> <p>Slack has also made heavy investments for Enterprise Adoption, with things like <a href="https://slackhq.com/introducing-slack-enterprise-grid">Enterprise Grid</a> (also in 2017! hmm...). I of course don't have any insight into Slack's growth in the Enterprise. I'm fully aware of the economic incentives of going upmarket and forsaking low end customers.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="communities-over-teams">Communities Over Teams</h2> <p>The net result of all this is that Slack is now very much not <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-design/a/stewart-butterfield/">the operating system for your team</a> that it set out to be. However its entire user experience is tied to teams.</p> <p>More specifically - having one single home team, interacting with that team on one device, and the assumption that you don't join or change teams very often. Perhaps this is the disconnect we are sensing.</p> <p> Slack's focus on teams may be becoming outdated in this new world we live in, where Deep Work and organized knowledge bases come at a premium, and our professional work crosses professional and personal boundaries, and spans across multiple devices, modalities and even multiple communities we both lead and participate in. Discord's focus on communities may win hearts and eventually wallets. Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/kurtkemple/status/1260947289436303367?s=20">Kurt Kemple on Discord's community features</a>, for thought: </p> <blockquote> <p>Discord is more community friendly IMO. Things like moderation, roles, boosting, group A/V, all make it a great place for a more democratized and scaleable platform.</p> </blockquote> <p>By focusing on communities instead of siloed teams, Discord becomes a friend of community leaders. In other words, <strong>Discord aggregates aggregators</strong>. In a world of <a href="https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation Theory</a>, this is a very good thing.</p> <p>I thought it was Paul Graham or Benedict Evans who said this, but am unable to find the source: "What hackers do for fun today, we will do at work tomorrow".</p> <p><strong>Hackers are deserting Slack in droves</strong>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>In the last few months, I’ve heard these 4 statements from 4 different people:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I wish I could write like Paul Graham.”</li>
<li>“If I had to pick one writer to imitate, it would be Paul Graham.”</li>
<li>“Paul Graham’s writing is the epitome of clarity.”</li>
<li>“Paul Graham inspired me to start writing.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This widespread sentiment motivated me to dive deeper into Graham’s writing, with help from my collaborator &amp; writing mentor <strong><a href="https://www.writing.coach/jaworski" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. William Jaworski</a>.</strong> What’s Paul Graham doing that’s so special? In the world of writing, what do his fingerprints look like?</p>
<p>Here’s what we’ve observed.</p>
<h2><b>He organizes each essay around a razor-sharp core idea.</b><b><br>
</b><b></b></h2>
<center><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A7eI-qYNuw8/Uj4ShMr5GVI/AAAAAAABtlA/3rCowIs3EmA/s1600/blood+of+a+poet+6.gif" alt="" width="499" height="374"></center>
<p><em>All imagery in this blog post comes from the 1930 film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021331/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Blood of a Poet.</strong></a></em></p>
<p>Every essay needs a core idea. Maybe you think of it as the focal point, the thesis, or the argument you’re making. Dr. Jaworski frames it as “a pithy one-liner that serves as an organizing principle for the whole essay.”</p>
<p>When you’re in tune with a core idea, writing feels easier. Intrusive thoughts soften and recede. You’re able to slow down and think more systematically. You start to see where your essay will end (and where a different one might begin—another day). You have a bullseye in your sights.</p>
<p>Usually, you can grasp the core idea of a Paul Graham essay by reading the title. My favorite examples are <a href="http://paulgraham.com/mod.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Two Kinds of Moderate</a>, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/genius.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius</a>, and <a href="http://paulgraham.com/talk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Write Like You Talk</a>. As you read any of those, you’ll see how every paragraph, and in fact every sentence, connects with the core idea. His focus is sharp and unwavering.</p>
<p>Admire that commitment &amp; focus, but realize that even for Graham, essay ideas aren’t sharp from the get-go. Don’t let hazy vision dissuade you: a blurry bullseye is better than no bullseye. The important thing is to not give up—and also to avoid falling in love with any particular idea.</p>
<p>…which brings me to a new point about Paul Graham’s writing!</p>
<h2><b>He doesn’t fall in love with his ideas.</b></h2>
<center><img src="https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-2-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-2-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-2-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-2-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-2-434x244.jpeg 434w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-2-868x488.jpeg 868w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-2.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></center>
<p>From experience, Paul Graham knows even <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smart people have bad ideas.</a> That’s why it’s important not to get caught up in your own. Some of your ideas will be good; some won’t. That’s fine. In fact, it’s completely inevitable: if you want to have good ideas, you have to accept the reality of having bad ones.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://paulgraham.com/useful.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Write Usefully</a>, Paul Graham states this principle about as point-blank as it gets:</p>
<p><i>If you write a bad sentence, you don’t publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay. You can’t ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren’t.</i></p>
<p>Graham’s essay <a href="http://paulgraham.com/13sentences.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startups in 13 Sentences</a> is a subtler illustration of the same idea. There’s no fancy technical footwork—structurally, it’s a plain-Jane listicle. Yet, there’s real insight in it. There’s the feeling that these ideas have weight and presence. That’s because those 13 ideas have been curated from a wide range of options. The essay is not the product of 13 ideas; it’s the product of 1,000+ ideas, narrowed down to 13. Before that essay ever saw the light of day, Paul Graham sifted through many good, bad, and half-decent ideas, and selected the best.</p>
<p>When Paul Graham starts thinking, he often finds dead ends. He explores the twists &amp; turns his thoughts can take, and eventually he finds the path down which he most wants to guide his readers. Choosing that path to the exclusion of the others requires being a ruthless self-editor—someone who can step back &amp; observe his own writing from a healthy distance. This process is the mark of a good thinker, and it’s also a mark of a good writer.</p>
<h2><b>He couples concepts with concrete examples.</b></h2>
<center><img src="https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="537" srcset="https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-3.jpg 808w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-3-300x230.jpg 300w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-3-768x589.jpg 768w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-3-434x333.jpg 434w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></center>
<p>About 70% of Paul Graham’s essays contain the word “example,” usually within the phrase “for example.” When he introduces an abstract idea, you’re never more than a sentence or two away from a well-picked example.</p>
<p>For example, in <a href="http://paulgraham.com/copy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copy What You Like</a>, Graham writes, “<b><i>It’s easy to be drawn into imitating flaws,</i></b><i> because they’re easier to see, and of course easier to copy too.”</i></p>
<p>On its own, that sentence isn’t too useful. But immediately, Graham supplies a real example:</p>
<p><b><i>For example,</i></b><i> most painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries used brownish colors. They were imitating the great painters of the Renaissance, whose paintings by that time were brown with dirt. Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealing brilliant colors; their imitators are of course still brown.</i></p>
<p>Thanks to that follow-up, I have a better sense of what Graham means.</p>
<p>Graham uses lots of examples because he knows <b>concepts are tools</b> used for thinking about the world. But a tool is helpful only if you know how to use it, and you learn how to use a concept by applying it to real things.</p>
<p>Paul Graham’s examples show you how to apply concepts to real life. Applying unfamiliar concepts to familiar examples makes those concepts easier to master.</p>
<p>Here are three more short meta-examples:</p>
<h5>From <a href="http://paulgraham.com/noob.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Being a Noob</a>:</h5>
<p><b><i>The more of a noob you are locally, the less of a noob you are globally.</i></b> <b><i>For example</i></b><i>, if you stay in your home country, you’ll feel less of a noob than if you move to Farawavia, where everything works differently. And yet you’ll know more if you move.</i></p>
<h5>From <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stuff</a>:</h5>
<p><b><i>Nothing owns you like fragile stuff. For example,</i></b><i> the “good china” so many households have, and whose defining quality is not so much that it’s fun to use, but that one must be especially careful not to break it.</i></p>
<h5>From <a href="http://paulgraham.com/work.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Doesn’t Seem Like Work</a>:</h5>
<p><b><i>If something that seems like work to other people doesn’t seem like work to you, that’s something you’re well suited for. For example,</i></b><i> a lot of programmers I know, including me, actually like debugging. It’s not something people tend to volunteer; one likes it the way one likes popping zits. But you may have to like debugging to like programming, considering the degree to which programming consists of it.</i></p>
<h2><b>He creates rhythm by varying sentence length.</b></h2>
<center><img src="https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-3.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="394" srcset="https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-3.jpeg 550w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-3-300x215.jpeg 300w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-3-434x311.jpeg 434w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></center>
<p>When people talk about a writer’s “voice,” they’re largely talking about the rhythm of the writing. Is it choppy? Is it droning? Does it feel conversational? Much of this comes down to the lengths of your sentences, and especially how you mix and match them.</p>
<p>Paul Graham rarely uses long sentences, but he mixes and matches short and medium-length sentences to create a rhythm that mirrors the pace of real conversation.</p>
<p>A well-placed short sentence creates a pause. The key expression here is <i>well-placed</i>: you wouldn’t want to listen to a speaker who follows every sentence with a dramatic pause. Paul Graham tends to taper the lengths of his sentences down until he reaches a key point—something he wants to emphasize. That’s where he pauses.</p>
<p>Here’s a perfect example from <a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life is Short</a>. Notice how Paul Graham uses the two shortest sentences in the paragraph (bolded), nestled among longer ones, to create points of salience.</p>
<p><i>If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they’re gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. </i><b><i>Their lives are short too.</i></b><i> After my mother died, I wished I’d spent more time with her. I lived as if she’d always be there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. </i><b><i>But an illusion it was.</i></b><i> I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.</i></p>
<p>During our review of Paul Graham’s writing, <a href="https://www.writing.coach/jaworski" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Jaworski</a> identified this technique and explained it to me. As part of his explanation, he wrote this awesome paragraph that I can’t help but share:</p>
<p>“Imagine you and I are taking a leisurely stroll, conversing as we go—the pace of our words matching the pace of our strides. Then something happens. There’s something I want to say, but I have trouble saying it. It’s important. We slow down. We stop. I struggle to find the words. I utter them. One. By. One. For emphasis. See? I’m being waggish, of course, but I trust you see the point: when you want to emphasize something, you need to slow the reader’s pace with shorter sentences and bolder punctuation. Conversely, when you’ve covered what’s important, you need to regain momentum using longer sentences and lighter punctuation, and might even forgo full stops entirely in favor of commas, conjunctions, semi-colons, dashes, and other devices that keep the reader moving.”</p>
<p>For me, Dr. Jaworski’s illustration is the most intuitive way to understand this technique. Of course, that doesn’t mean I’ll master it overnight—it takes practice and patience. But now, I have an effective metaphor to guide me.</p>
<h2><b>He doesn’t underestimate your intelligence.</b></h2>
<p>Yes, Paul Graham prefers short sentences and short words—his essays pass <strong><a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Hemingway test</a></strong> with flying colors. But that doesn’t mean he’s dumbing his writing down. Quite the opposite: Graham knows he’s talking about sophisticated ideas, so he presents them cleanly, getting his writing out of the way. He avoids over-explaining things, which is a great way to evade rabbit holes.</p>
<p>Basically, he knows how to put himself in a smart reader’s shoes, and as soon as he starts thinking, “Yep, I get it”—he stops.</p>
<h2><b>He’s codified his own rules, and he follows them.</b></h2>
<center><img src="https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-4.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-4.jpeg 640w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-4-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://ellenrhymes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blood-of-a-poet-4-434x326.jpeg 434w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></center>
<p>In 2005, Paul Graham codified <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his own rules</a> for writing, and they’re exquisite. Get this: on my team of experienced writers, none of us had seen Graham’s rules before—but in our own separate ways, we’d each already learned to follow them.</p>
<p>So, straight from the horse’s mouth, here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over.</li>
<li>cut out everything unnecessary.</li>
<li>write in a conversational tone.</li>
<li>develop a nose for bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours.</li>
<li>imitate writers you like.</li>
<li>if you can’t get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said.</li>
<li>expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>In her 2001 book <em>Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke</em>, Professor Napier showed that many fans of
anime work in computer science and its related fields. The survey also happened to show that “over
70 percent had a grade point average of 3.0 or higher, which is especially impressive when one
considers the academic rigor of scientific fields.”</p>
<p>Anime has a pretty well-known reputation for creating <a href="https://youtu.be/755BDwzxv5c?t=3">men of culture</a>. That’s a clear
indication that anime fans can be profoundly affected by the medium. In addition, many prolific
open source contributors have anime characters as their profile picture. So that got me to thinking,
does being a fan of anime also make you a more intelligent person?</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laynH/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books/master/C%2B%2B/Sakura_Nene_CPP.jpg" alt="sakura nene cpp"></p>
<p>Of course, a question like that is nearly impossible to answer directly. After all, there’s
countless ways to measure intelligence, and anime fandom is so broad that no one definition can fit
all cases. For example, should we consider someone who has only watched <em>Spirited Away</em>, and liked
it very much, but has no exposure to other forms of anime, to be an anime fan? What about people who
only read manga? Or those who exclusively watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leader_(web_series)">whatever this is supposed to be</a>?</p>
<p>A smaller question that’s easily answerable would be to see if having an anime profile picture
correlates with you being a better programmer. After all, if someone takes the effort to set their
profile picture to a waifu, they clearly have some fondness for anime. As for being a “better
programmer,” we’ll just equate being better with having more activity on GitHub. And being good at
programming does require an amount of critical reasoning at logic skill, which should equate to a
higher intelligence. Of course, this metric could be easily abused by having a <code>cron</code> job making a
ton of commits, but it’s a measure of programming activity that should be Good Enough™.</p>
<p>Luckily, Google provides their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">image labelling API</a> for very cheap (or free, if you
have GCP credit). As an example, putting in an image of best girl Mai Sakurajima from <em>Rascal Does
Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai</em> into the demo provided, I’ll get this list of labels back from it:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/mai_google_vision.png" alt="mai"></p>
<p>Notice how one of the labels is “Anime”? That’s a surprise tool that will help us later :) Google
also provides a Python API, which makes it even easier to check images, since all you have to do now
is check if “Anime” is one of the tags:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>anime_or_not</span><span>(</span><span>image</span><span>):</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>label_detection</span><span>(</span><span>image</span><span>=</span><span>image</span><span>)</span>
    <span>labels</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>label_annotations</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>labels</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>item</span><span>.</span><span>description</span> <span>==</span> <span>"Anime"</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As for GitHub commits, we can use the <a href="https://docs.github.com/v3/activity/event_types/">events API</a> that’s roughly analogous to the
contribution history graph of a user. We’ll be measuring user activity just by the number of events
for each user, so each event (opening a PR, creating a repo, etc.) is given equal weight. That’s
roughly analogous to how green a user’s contribution heatmap is.</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/github_contribution_graph.png" alt="contribution map"></p>
<p><a href="https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyGitHub</a> wraps the GitHub API into an easy to use library, so getting the number of
events for a user, as well as their profile picture’s URL, is pretty simple:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>g</span><span>.</span><span>get_users</span><span>()</span>

<span>for</span> <span>user</span> <span>in</span> <span>users</span><span>:</span>
    <span>event_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>event</span> <span>in</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>get_events</span><span>():</span>
        <span>event_count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>

    <span>is_anime_image</span> <span>=</span> <span>check_if_weeb</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>avatar_url</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>GitHub does rate limit the API to 5000 requests per hour for authenticated users. That’s enough to
run about 2000 requests per hour. To get around that, we can take advantage of how GitHub profile
IDs are numbered sequentially and process profiles in batches of 1000:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>github_id</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1200000</span><span>,</span> <span>1201000</span><span>):</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>g</span><span>.</span><span>get_user</span><span>(</span><span>github_id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
        <span>continue</span>

    <span># do user stuff here
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>I’ve modified the <code>get_user</code> function here to use the undocumented <code>/user/:id</code> endpoint. This hasn’t
been implemented in PyGitHub yet, but <a href="https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1615">this issue</a> seems to be tracking it.</p>
<p>All that’s left is to link these APIs up and save the data. It’s trivial to just loop through all
users using the <code>/users</code> GitHub API endpoint, send their image over to the Google Vision API, note
down whether they had an anime profile picture and the number of events for that user, and finally
log it into a CSV for analysis later. That’s exactly what I did, and you can see my code
<a href="https://github.com/h313/anime-face">here</a>. It’s very research quality, so don’t expect much.</p>
<p>So now I’ve got a table of 3497 GitHub profiles, of which only 23 have anime profile pictures.
Here’s a box plot that displays the distribution of user activity by profile picture type:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/github_boxplot.png" alt="box plot"></p>
<p>Hmm, the users with an anime profile picture do seem to have a higher average number of
activities. But we can’t stop here. Keep in mind that there’s way more samples of users without
anime profile pictures compared to those with, as well as the comparatively high amount of
outliers in both groups. To be sure that the difference here is statistically significant,
we’ll need to do a T-test:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>scipy.stats</span> <span>import</span> <span>ttest_ind</span>

<span>cat1</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>[</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'is_anime_face'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>True</span><span>]</span>
<span>cat2</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>[</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'is_anime_face'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>False</span><span>]</span>

<span>ttest_ind</span><span>(</span><span>cat1</span><span>[</span><span>'contribs'</span><span>],</span> <span>cat2</span><span>[</span><span>'contribs'</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That provides a p-value of <code>0.2371</code>. We now have to conclude that the higher average we got isn’t
statistically significant, since our p-value of 23.7% doesn’t meet the traditional 5% cutoff.
Therefore, we must once again acquiesce to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines">Betteridge’s law</a>, and adopt our null
hypothesis, that having an anime profile picture does not necessarily correlate with your abilities
as a programmer.</p>
<p>Further work into this topic can be done, however. Since this project only looked at a small
number of users, who were among the first to register, it is not a representative slice of the
GitHub user population. In addition, it may also be enlightening to include the inactive users
skipped in this experiment.</p>

<p>Wirth’s law is not really a law. Actually, none of them ever are laws. They are adages:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>a proverb or short statement expressing a general truth.</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/adage">https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/adage</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Here is another law that is not a real law:&nbsp;<em>Moore’s law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years.</em></p>



<p>This means that we can expect the speed and capability of computers to increase while lowering the costs. Sadly, this is where Wirth’s law comes in:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Wirth’s law is an adage on computer performance which states that software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster.</em></p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>And while Moore’s law has proven to be true since 1975, Wirth’s law seems to be true as well. Niklaus Wirth, the designer of Pascal, wrote an article in 1995:</p>



<blockquote><p>About 25 years ago, an interactive text editor could be designed with as little as 8,000 bytes of storage. (Modern program editors request 100 times that much!) An operating system had to manage with 8,000 bytes, and a compiler had to fit into 32 Kbytes, whereas their modern descendants require megabytes. Has all this inflated software become any faster? On the contrary. Were it not for a thousand times faster hardware, modern software would be utterly unusable.</p><cite>Niklaus Wirth – A Plea for Lean Software</cite></blockquote>



<p>The problem of modern software development is manyfold. Wirth points out one crucial aspect: time.</p>



<blockquote><p>Time pressure is probably the foremost reason behind the emergence of bulky software.</p><cite>Niklaus Wirth – A Plea for Lean Software</cite></blockquote>



<p>And while that was true back in 1995, that is no longer the most important factor. We now have to deal with a much bigger problem: abstraction. Developers never built things from scratch, and that has never been a problem, but now they have also become lazy.</p>



<p>It was Edsger W. Dijkstra who tried to improve the quality of code and coined the concept of <em>structured programming</em>. He tried to get programming out of the state of crisis it was in, and he found support in programmers like Harlan D. Mills, Richard C. Linger and Bernard I. Witt. For a short period of time, programming was seen as a real craftmanship. Programmers cared about the quality of their programs, and that included clarity and efficiency.</p>



<p>Those times have passed. With the introduction of higher-level languages such as Java, Ruby, PHP and Javascript all in 1995, the same year in which Wirth wrote his article, programming became more abstract. </p>



<p>Languages like these made programming a lot easier and took many things out of the programmer’s hands. They were object-oriented and came with things as an IDE and garbage collection.</p>



<p>This meant that programmers had fewer things to worry about, which is of course great. Sadly, everything comes with a price. Having fewer things to worry about, also means having fewer things to think about. 1995 was the year in which programmers stopped thinking about the quality of their programs.</p>



<p>It also marked the beginning of the widespread use of libraries, probably one of the bigger problems. Don’t get me wrong, I love libraries. They are the only reason I am able to get things done. However, a library never comes with the exact things that you need.</p>



<p>Because a library is not made for one specific project, it probably has a bit more functionalities than you really needed. No problem, you would say. However, things pile up pretty quickly. Even the people who like libraries, don’t want to reinvent the wheel. This results in what we call dependency hell. <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/04/09/ride-down-the-javascript-dependency-hell.html">Nikola Duza wrote a post about that issue in Javascript</a>.</p>



<p>The problem does not seem that big, but try to grasp what is happening here. In another tutorial that Nikola wrote, he built a simple todo-list. It works in your browser with HTML and Javascript. How many dependencies did he use? <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/05/14/javascript-growing-pains-from-0-to-13000-dependencies.html">13,000.</a></p>



<p>These numbers are insane, but this problem will only keep increasing. As new, very useful libraries keep being built, the number of dependencies per project will keep growing as well.</p>



<p>That means that the problem Niklaus was warning us about in 1995, only gets bigger over time. </p>



<p>And no, you don’t have to learn assembly and start writing your web application in that. A good way to start would be to split up libraries. Instead of creating one big library that does everything you could ever possibly need, just create many libraries. Your god-like library could still exist, but solely as a wrapper. </p>



<p>This way a programmer only has to select the libraries he really requires, while ignoring the functionalities he is not going to use in his application. Not only are his dependencies smaller, but they will also use less of their dependencies because the dependencies of the unused functionalities do not have to be installed.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Note: </strong>The proposed solution obviously is not <em>the</em> solution. It would for example require a good way of versioning software to avoid a new dependency hell.</p></blockquote>

<p><span>T</span>he only person David Kiragu lied to about the texts was his mom. To those close to him, like his partner, friends, former schoolmates, and work colleagues, he explained what was going on. To more distant contacts, including annoying relatives, he said nothing.</p>



<p>His mother probably knew he was lying — mothers often do — but she let it slide.</p>



<p>“I couldn’t tell her the truth,” Kiragu said to me last December. “So I told her it was one of those prison scams and she should ignore it.”</p>



<p>He owed money. Not a lot of it, but that didn’t matter. His fintech creditor was still telling everyone in Kiragu’s inner circle that he was a deadbeat.</p>



<p>It happened like this: Toward the end of March 2018, Kiragu found himself in a bind. At 32, he earned a solid income as a manager at an iNGO in Nairobi. But for the first time in his life, he couldn’t make rent.</p>



<p>His choices were limited. He could always borrow the remainder from friends, family, or somebody else in his network. The problem was that if he did, people would know he was living beyond his means.</p>



<p>But then one morning Kiragu logged into his Facebook account and saw an ad for a fintech app called OKash that promised to be the discreet friend who would spot him some cash and never mention it again. Offering the ability to “process loans in seconds,” OKash is one of many fintech apps that have sprung up in Kenya since 2012. All he needed to do was download the app, enter his financial details, and let the algorithm generate a credit rating. He would get the money he needed and could pay it back once he was liquid.</p>



<p>He doesn’t remember that day too well now, but Kiragu thinks it took just minutes to apply for his loan. His money arrived right away, so he paid his bills and moved on. “I started with about $15, which I repaid [on time], and my loan limit expanded. Then I borrowed about $35, which I also repaid,” he told me as we sat on the balcony of a chic restaurant in a mall outside Nairobi.</p>



<p>It was the third loan that upended his life. He needed it to top up his rent, because by then a vicious cycle had begun, wherein he would pay off his loan then borrow again to fill the hole that the last payment had left in his finances.</p>



<p>Kiragu started getting calls even before that deadline passed.</p>



<p>“Will you repay your OKash loan?” Kiragu remembers a caller asking him, before warning that if he missed a payment, the company would notify everyone on his contact list. In texts he showed me on his phone, an OKash representative had written an hour before the deadline lapsed, “Despite several polite reminders on your OKash loan . . . No PAYMENT received yet . . . Note that we are going to invade your privacy according to Terms of Service clause 8, IF NOT CLEARED BY 4PM.” The clause in question reads as follows: “In the event we cannot get in contact with you or your emergency contact, you also expressly authorise us to contact any and all persons in your contact list.”</p>



<p>In the days after the deadline, debt collectors hounded Kiragu, calling three to four times every hour. They also cast a wide net. “They texted just about everyone I know,” Kiragu says. His parents and many friends got messages. One of his colleagues even shared a screenshot of a text from OKash in an office-wide WhatsApp Group.</p>



<p>“Some [people] sympathized with me,” Kiragu wrote in a Facebook post about the experience. “Some were laughing at me and some were actually very annoyed that OKash is exposing and shaming me . . . Even my boss called me to ask if everything is okay.”</p>



<p>But his colleagues weren’t his main concern. What worried him more was what his parents would think. After an estranged aunt shared the message within his village, Kiragu’s father accused him of bringing shame on the family.</p>



<p>This was nearly two years ago, but the memory is still raw, so much so that Kiragu asked to use a pseudonym for this article. “If you pay on time, they are angels,” Kiragu said as he sipped his tea and stared at a potted plant behind me. “They keep texting you to take out another loan with them. If you do and won’t or can’t pay, then it’s pretty simple: Pay or we damage what you value most.”</p>

Naomi Wanjiku, a M-Pesa agent, arranges a customer's transaction at a M-Pesa kiosk in South B, a residential area of the city. M-Pesa, (M for mobile, pesa is Swahili for money), is a Kenyan cellphone-based money transfer service. The majority of its customers have no bank accounts, but they withdraw cash and make payments or send money using their cell phones. A network of appointed agents, scattered all over the country, provide the cashing handling services.

<hr>



<p><strong>In 2007, Safaricom</strong>, Kenya’s biggest telecoms provider, launched M-Pesa, a mobile wallet that allowed users to send and receive money and buy airtime. Smartphones were just becoming popular, so Safaricom tailored its fintech product to the basic cell phones most Kenyans already owned. It was immediately hailed as a revolutionary way to bring millions of “unbanked” customers into the formal financial sector. The Clinton Global Initiative and other major philanthropic organizations were vocal supporters, and it was soon being taught as a case study in business schools around the world. It was also a success on the ground: Safaricom aimed to sign up 350,000 M-Pesa users by the end of 2007, but by November it had already attracted over 1 million. From there, it only continued to grow. As of last September, 23.6 million Kenyans — nearly half of the country’s population — were using it regularly.</p>



<p>M-Pesa was initially meant to be a microfinance project; its first sales pitch to users was “Send Money Home.” It was banking on the fact that while working-class Kenyans who lived away from home wanted to support their families, cash is expensive. This was not a new concept; among Somalis, the Hawala system exists to address this same problem. If you want to send money to someone, you give it to a local agent, who then contacts a second agent located in the same area as the intended recipient, and that agent then disburses the money. Both agents earn a small commission, and they sort each other out.</p>



<p>In Kenya, there were several factors behind M-Pesa’s rapid ascent. One was that 2007 was an election year, and when violence erupted over the results, having a way to transfer money without leaving the house felt to Kenyans like a godsend. Another, more structural, reason was that before M-Pesa, the country’s banking sector served only a portion of the population. Kenya’s economy collapsed four times between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, by which point the banks were heavily regulated. It was nearly impossible for low-income Kenyans, including millennials, to get loans. No such legal barriers applied to fintech.</p>



<p>When fintech took off, banks, Silicon Valley–backed products, private-equity products, and Kenyan companies all began competing for the same clients. One of the first savings-and-lending apps, called M-Shwari, was launched in 2012 through a partnership between a local bank and Safaricom. Some of its earliest users were Kenyans in the informal economy. In a 2017 social media post, for example, a business journalist noted that “up to a third of loans are taken between the hours of 3am and 5am. Most are repaid within twenty-four hours.” When the Central Bank looked into what was going on, they discovered that a typical user was a market seller who would wake up early and borrow enough money to pay everybody in her supply chain that day. She would then work until evening, pay back the loan, and repeat the cycle again the next morning.</p>



<p>Within a few years, credit-app use had started to spread throughout Kenyan society. Over a 13-year period, financial inclusion<a href="https://fsdkenya.org/publication/finaccess2019/"> jumped</a> from nearly 27 percent, in 2006, to almost 83 percent. And the product side grew as well. As of September 2018, according to a report from Financial Sector Deepening Kenya (FSD), the two main app stores offered 110 credit apps.</p>



<p>Almost all of these companies make their money by providing short-term loans with high interest rates. But that’s often where transparency around the business model ends. Since there is no regulatory framework governing fintech, it is hard to know who exactly owns an app or even where the money is coming from. The absence of regulation has many perks for the sector and one major liability: As companies soon discovered, if a user does not pay back what they have borrowed, plus interest, there is little a digital lender can do. Users can simply delete the app and move on. One solution to this problem has been to flag defaulters to one of Kenya’s three credit reference bureaus (CRBs), effectively locking them out of the credit market. It’s unclear how effective this strategy is, but it’s frequently used. Between 2014 and 2017, about 2.7 million Kenyans were negatively listed with a CRB, 15 percent of them for defaulting on loans of less than about $2. Last year, “how to check CRB status” was among the most-Googled questions in Kenya, between “how to be successful in life” and “how to get pregnant.”</p>



<p>Before long, digital lenders started looking into other methods of recouping their investments. Skip tracing, the ancient art of finding someone who owes you money and making them pay, was virtually nonexistent among fintech companies until early 2018. Coincidentally, that was the same year that Opay, a fintech company partially owned by the software-maker Opera, launched OKash in Kenya. The majority of Opera’s operations had been bought by a consortium of Chinese investors two years earlier, and shortly afterward, the company went on an expansion spree, announcing plans to invest $100 million in East Africa. While Opera’s then managing director, a former banker&nbsp; named Edward Ndichu, said at the time that the app would protect users’ personal information, he never explained how the company planned to safeguard its financial investment. But the answer was buried in OKash’s terms and conditions: When users download the app, they give it permission to access their contacts.</p>

                              The last weeks I have played with the programming language <a href="http://setl.org/">SETL</a> (<b>Set L</b>anguage). I like learning these kind of "paradigmatic" programming language even if they are not very much in use anymore. There is almost always new things to learn from them, or they make one to see well known things in a new light.
</p><p>
SETL was created in the late 1960's and is to be considered one early very high level language (VHLL) using sets as the bearing principle (like mathematical formulation) together with a PASCAL-like syntax. Some trivia:
</p><ul>
 <li> The first validating ADA compiler was written in SETL.
 </li><li> ABC, one of the inspirations of Python was inspired by SETL.
 </li><li> SETL is attributed as the first programming language that supported list (set/array) comprehensions. A very handy concept. Haskell's list comprehensions was inspired by SETL. 
</li></ul><p>

For more about the history of SETL, see <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/~bacon/phd-thesis/diss/node7.html">A Brief History of SETL</a> in David Bacon's dissertation "SETL for Internet Data Processing". David Bacon is the person behind GNU SETL. In the section <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/~bacon/phd-thesis/diss/node52.html">Comparison with Other Languages</a> Bacon compares SETL with some other languages (Perl, Icon, Functional Languages, Python, Rexx, and Java).
</p><p>
I like SETL, much for its handling of sets and tuples (arrays) which make prototyping of some kinds of problem easy, especially those with a mathematical bent. However, the advantages SETL once had as been a VHLL, prior to the "agile" languages - e.g. Perl, Python, Ruby, Haskell, etc - is not so big anymore. (I should probably mention that I'm at least acquainted with these mentioned languages..)
</p><p>
In case I forgot it: See my <a href="http://www.hakank.org/setl/">SETL page</a> with links and my SETL programs (and maybe some not mentioned here).

</p><h3>Different versions of SETL</h3><p>
There are some the different versions (or off springs) of SETL:
 </p><ul>
   <li> <a href="http://setl.org/">GNU SETL</a>. This is the version I use here, and seems to be the only public available and working version.
   </li><li> SETL2. Documented as a draft at <a href="http://www.settheory.com/">The Restored Eye</a> (settheory.com).
   </li><li> ISETL. See <a href="http://raider.muc.edu/~kirchmjf/isetlj/isetlj.html">ISETLJ</a>, ISETL in Java which is to released in May/June this year. ISETL has been used in teaching mathematics, e.g. abstract algebra.
 </li></ul>


<h2>Examples of SETL</h2><p>
I will not go through all features of SETL here, just show some example of what I have done and like about the language. See <a href="http://www.settheory.com/">Programming in SETL. (Draft in Progress)</a> (at settheory.com) for an in-depth tutorial of the language (SETL2 but much is also applied to SETL), or Robert B. K. Dewar's <a href="http://www.setl-lang.org/docs/setlprog.pdf">The SETL Programming Language</a> (PDF) for an overview, or <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6805?page=0,2">An Invitation to SETL</a>.

</p><p>
All the examples below works with GNU SETL. Many of the smaller examples is shown as a command one-liner, since I often test different features this way. And as you may notice, quite a few of the examples are not very unlike programs written in Python or Haskell.
</p><p>
The mandatory <b>prime generation</b> program:
</p><pre> primes2 := {p in {2..10000} | forall i in {2..fix(sqrt(p))} | p mod i /= 0};
 print(primes2);
</pre><p>

One feature I like (and use a lot) is test things from the command line:
</p><pre>$ setl 'time0:=time();primes:= {p in {2..100000} | forall i in {2..fix(sqrt(p))} | p mod i /= 0}; 
   print("Num primes:",#primes);print("It took", (time()-time0)/1000,"seconds");'
Num primes: 9592
It took 2.222 seconds
</pre><p>

A variant of <b>prime number generation</b> using <code>not exists</code> instead of <code>forall</code>:
</p><pre>$ setl 'print({n in {2..100} | (not (exists m in{2..n - 1} | n mod m = 0))}); '
{2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97}
</pre><p>

Still another variant using intersection of <code>{2..n}</code> and the compound numbers:
</p><pre>$ setl 'n := 150; print({2..n} - {x : x in {2..n} | exists y in {2..fix(sqrt(x))} | x mod y = 0});'
{2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 101 103 107 109 113 127 131 137 139 149}
</pre><p>
Here are some other examples of set/array comprehensions.</p><p>
<b>Fibonacci sequence</b>
As a one liner:
</p><pre>$ setl 'f:= [1,1]; r := [f(i) := f(i-1)+f(i-2) : i in [3..10]];  print(f);'
</pre>

<p><b>Pythagorean triplets</b> as a "one-liner" (not very fast for say [1..300]).
</p><pre>$ setl 'print({[a, b, h]: b in {1..30}, a in {1..b - 1} | 	
		(exists h in {2..a + b} | (a*a + b*b = h*h)) and 
		(not (exists d in {2..b - 1} | ((b mod d) = 0 and (a mod d) = 0)))}); '
{[3 4 5] [5 12 13] [7 24 25] [8 15 17] [20 21 29]}
</pre><p>

Creation of a <b>power set</b> (all subsets of a set), with the intermediate values printed; 
</p><pre>$ setl 'a := {1,2,3}; p := { {}}; (for x in A, y in P) p with:= Y with x; print(p); end; print(p);'
{{} {1}}
{{} {1} {2}}
{{} {1} {2} {1 2}}
{{} {1} {2} {3} {1 2}}
{{} {1} {2} {3} {1 2} {1 3}}
{{} {1} {2} {3} {1 2} {1 3} {2 3}}
{{} {1} {2} {3} {1 2} {1 3} {2 3} {1 2 3}}
{{} {1} {2} {3} {1 2} {1 3} {2 3} {1 2 3}}
</pre>

<p><b>Collect</b> values from a tuple to a map (hash table).<br>
A map is represented as a set of tuples of <code>[key, value]</code>. 
<br>
First a slow solution:
</p><pre>a := [1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4];
m:={ [i, #[j : j in [1..#a] | a(j) = i ]] :  i in { i : i in a}};
</pre><p>
Then a faster version:
</p><pre>$ setl 'a := [1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4];  m:= {}; for i in a loop m(i) +:= 1; end loop; print(m);'
{[1 2] [2 2] [3 3] [4 4]}
</pre>

<p><b>Index and value of a map</b><br>
The construct <code>for x = s(i) in ...</code> in a map (hash table) loop gives both the index (i) and the value (x). Here we also see how to represent ranges with increment other than 1 (much like Haskell).
</p><pre>setl 's := {[i,i**2] : i in [1,3..15]}; for x = s(i) loop print(i,x); end loop;'
1 1
3 9
5 25
7 49
9 81
11 121
13 169
15 225
</pre>

<p><b>Multi-map</b> (<code>m{value}</code>)<br>
SETL has a special syntax for multi-maps, i.e. where a key has more than one values: use "{}" instead of using the parenthesis "()" for accessing. Here the key <i>1</i> has two values (<i>a</i> and <i>c</i>). Using a "single-map" access (<code>a(2)</code> gives <code>OM</code>, the special undefined value (represented as "*" i GNU SETL).
</p><pre>setl 'a := {[1,["a"]], [2, ["b"]], [1, ["c"]]}; print(a);print(a(2));print(a(1));print(a{1});'
{[1 [a]] [1 [c]] [2 [b]]}
[b]
*
{[a] [c]}
</pre>


<p><b>Compound operators</b><br>
With a compound operators (as <code><b>op</b>/tuple</code> or <code><b>op</b>/map</code>) makes it possible to write quite sparse code (somewhat akin to APL and <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/">J</a>). Here is the factorial of 100, also showing the support for arbitrary precision.
</p><pre>$ setl 'print(*/[1..20]);'
2432902008176640000
</pre><p>

There is no built-in <code>max</code> for tuples. Instead we use the compound operator version, which is possible since <code>max</code> is a binary operator:
</p><pre>$ setl 'setrandom(0); print(<b>max</b>/[random(10000) : i in [1..100]]);'
9898
</pre><p>

Another example of compound operators is from Project Euler problem #5 (<i>the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20</i>). In my solution (<a href="http://www.hakank.org/setl/project_euler5.setl">project_euler5.setl</a>) lcm and gcd is defined as operators (in contrast to procedures):
</p><pre>print(lcm/[2..20]); -- Prints the answer.

op lcm(a,b);
  g := a gcd b;
  return (a*b) div g;
end op lcm;

op gcd(u, v);
  return if v = 0 then abs u else v gcd u mod v end;
end op;
</pre><p>

Speaking of Project Euler problems, here is the SETL program for the first problem (<i>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000</i>):
</p><pre>print(+/{i : i in [1..999] | i mod 3 = 0 or i mod 5 = 0});
</pre><p>

In <a href="http://www.hakank.org/setl/averages_pythagorean_means.setl">averages_pythagorean_means.setl</a>, three different version of mean are defined (as procedures) using compound operators (maybe not the most efficient way).
</p><pre>-- arithmetic mean
proc mean_A(x);   
  return +/x/#x; 
end proc;

-- geometric mean
proc mean_G(x); 
  return (*/x)**(1/#x);
end proc;

-- harmonic mean
proc mean_H(x);
  return #x/+/[1/i:i in x];
end proc;
</pre>

<p><b>Randomization</b>
The <code>setrandom(0)</code> is for creating random variables starting with an "arbitrary" seed. 
</p><pre>setl 'setrandom(0); s := [1,3,5,8]; print([random(s) : i in [1..10]]);'
[5 1 8 8 5 3 3 1 5 3]
</pre><p>

With a set we get a value only once:
</p><pre>$ setl 's1 := {1..10}; setrandom(0); print({ random(s1) : i in [1..10]});'
{3 5 6 7 8}
</pre><p>

In GNU SETL the <b>order</b> of the set is always presented as sorted, but this is not a requirement in the SETL language.

</p><p>
<b>Regular expressions</b><br>
GNU SETL has built in support for regular expressions (which standard SETL has not). Some examples:
</p><pre>$ setl 's:="nonabstractedness"; m:=s("a.*b.*c*.d*.e*"); print(s);print(m);'
nonabstractedness
abstractedness
</pre><p>

Also see <a href="http://www.hakank.org/setl/read_test2.setl">read_test2.setl</a> that search for words like this in a word file.
</p><p>
Substitution (cf. <code>gsub</code> for global substitution):
</p><pre>$ setl 's:="nonabstractedness"; m:=sub(s,"a.*b.*c*.d*.e*",""); print(s);print(m);'
non
abstractedness
</pre><p>

Note that GNU SETL don't support non-greedy regular expressions (i.e. the ".+?" constructs from Perl etc), so the plain old <code>[^...]</code> construct must be used.:
</p><pre>$ setl 's:="nonabstractedness"; m:=s("a[^s]+s"); print(s);print(m);'
nonabstractedness
abs
</pre><p>

A small drawback is that GNU SETL don't have support for national characters in strings. The only acceptable characters are the "plain ASCII".

</p><p>
<b>SNOBOL like pattern matching</b><br>
SETL also has SNOBOL/SPITBOL like patterns (but not as nicely integrated as in SNOBOL). Except as experiments, I tend to use regular expression rather than these functions.
</p><p>
Example: <a href="http://cs1.cs.nyu.edu/~bacon/setl-doc.html#any">any</a> is used like this:
</p><pre>$ setl 'x := "12345 12345 12345"; print(any(x, "123"));print(x);'
1
2345 12345 12345
</pre><p>

However, I miss the <code>many</code> function which takes <b>many</b> characters from the beginning, not just the first and it is quite easy to create it. First let's see how it works, where we will take all the characters from the beginning of the string if they are any of "123":
</p><pre>$ setl 'x := "12345 12345 12345"; print(x); while any(x, "123") /= "" loop print(x); end;;print(x);'
12345 12345 12345
2345 12345 12345
345 12345 12345
45 12345 12345
45 12345 12345
</pre><p>

(The corresponding regular expression for this is, of course <code>^[123]+</code>.)

</p><p>
A SETL procedure for <code>many</code> is defined below. The first argument is defined as read-write (<code>rw</code>) so we can modify the string <code>s</code>. The value returned (<code>z</code>) contains all the matched characters.
</p><pre>proc many(rw s,p); 
   z := "";
   while (zz := any(s,p)) /= "" and zz /= "" loop 
        z +:= zz; 
   end loop; 
   return z; 
end proc;'
</pre><p>

And here is <code>many</code> in action. Note: procedures must always be placed last in a program.
</p><pre>x := "12345 12345 12345";
print(x);
z:=many(x, "123");
print("x",x);
print("z",z);
proc many(rw s,p);
   print(s); print(p);
   while (zz := any(s,p)) /= "" and zz /= "" loop
   z …</pre></div></div>

The best science fiction writers can bring down the most powerful of institutions with a single sentence, and erect new ones in a paragraph. In her debut science fiction thriller <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765392364/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliotpeper-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0765392364&amp;linkId=ea04f87955358c624a47ab958e39b490" target="_blank">Infomocracy</a></i>, Malka Older mines her extensive experience in governance research to craft not only a nuanced vision for the future of democracy, but a globe-trotting adventure with a diverse cast that explores electioneering, information warfare, and human ambition.</p><p>

The story takes place a few decades from now in a world where Information, a theoretically nonpartisan internet monopoly, controls the network infrastructure for global micro-democracy. Instead of today’s nation states, <i>Infomocracy</i>’s political units are groups of 100,000 people (dubbed “centenals”) who can choose their respective governments from a large menu of potential options with their own unique policy priorities. At the height of the election cycle, a campaign staffer for one of the leading parties finds himself entangled with a subversive activist and a special agent from the implacable Information. What follows will make you rethink our own embattled institutions.</p><p>

Politics is a hard problem, and Older doesn’t oversimplify into utopia or dystopia. The complexity <i>Infomocracy</i> portrays is refreshing and grounded in Older’s personal history. Before turning novelist, she spent a decade as a humanitarian aid worker supervising major programs, implementing economic development initiatives, and responding to natural disasters and complex emergencies in Sri Lanka, Uganda, Darfur, Indonesia, Japan, and Mali. She is a Senior Fellow for Technology and Risk at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs and her doctoral research examines the unique challenges and paradoxes that acute crises pose for good governance. Writers of hard science fiction pride themselves on the technical credibility of the inventions their stories document. Older brings that attention to detail to the realm of political science, imagining a future sure to electrify policy wonks and geeks alike. The best science fiction leaves us breathless, not just because of its entertainment value, but because it changes how we see the world we inhabit. In today’s charged political climate, <i>Infomocracy</i> forces us to question our assumptions about the future of democracy.</p><p>

In the following conversation, we discuss how technology is changing political institutions and what future governments might look like.</p><div>
<p>
***</p><p>

<b>Is American democracy broken?</b></p><p>

American democracy was never quite democracy, and it was designed that way out of concern about what the democratic experiment would look like. It doesn’t only feature checks and balances on the branches of government; it’s also got checks and balances on the people (and, of course, was based on an entirely different notion of who “the people” are).</p><p>

Over the centuries since then, we’ve made it more democratic in some ways – most notably by expanding the franchise, but also, for example, by changing senate elections to a direct vote. On the other hand, (some of) those in power have also sought to adapt the system to their own needs: gerrymandering congressional districts, tweaking party rules and primaries, and finding more and more ways to make money off of political positions.</p><p>

So I’m not sure I’d say American democracy is broken. I would say we haven’t really given democracy a full try yet. We started off as a partial democracy, and have been fighting over how to expand or dilute it. Right now does feel like a particularly low ebb as institutions are being weakened, but at the same time we see that civil society is growing stronger.</p><p>

The other thing to remember is that democracy alone is not enough for good, participatory, equal government. It’s too easy for a democracy to become oppression by the majority, or devolve into demagoguery. Democracy requires, at a minimum, a solid basis in human rights that the majority can’t overrule and an educated electorate. The former is always under debate, and the latter is a major problem for us right now.</p><p>

<b>How do we evaluate the success or failure of the ongoing experiment that is our political system?</b></p><p>

In terms of evaluating our system, again I think we have to look beyond democracy. Democracy is a tool for achieving good governance and its many benefits, not an end in itself. We need to ask first if our system is inclusive, equal, participatory, because democracy is founded on the idea that the more people actively involved in government, the better that government will be.</p><p>

If we don’t believe that any more than we should stop calling ourselves democratic and come up with something new, but so far those principles seem to be borne out (as far as we can tell, given that we haven’t really tried them completely) and democracy is the best system we’ve developed as yet.</p><p>

Then we need to look at whether the system is functioning on a basic level – are decisions being made, are programs being implemented and evaluated? Checking on the conditions faced by the most vulnerable (whether through poverty, disability, age, marginalization, or some other status) is a good start for evaluating both types of criteria.</p><p>

<b>How is technology changing politics and policy?</b></p><p>

While technology is changing our politics somewhat, I think the more intriguing question is why isn’t it changing our politics more?</p><p>

One answer is that our government has largely fallen behind on tech, and isn’t devoting enough time or attention to it, with cybersecurity as just the most basic example. But part of the reason for that is that technological disruption is threatening to those in power, and particularly to those who don’t like to see change of any kind.</p><p>

There are all sorts of interesting democratic experiments we could do with current technology. While we see some of them in the private sector, for example in the form of new apps to help people learn about candidates and issues or share experiences across the political divide, more fundamental changes are going to be hard to push through people who have spent their careers honing their political skills for a certain playing field, and who don’t want to see it change now.</p><p>

<b>Where do we go from here?</b></p><p>

There are a couple of answers, along the axes realistic &lt;-&gt; idealistic (I’m trying not to do depressing right now, realism is already there) and short-term &lt;-&gt; long-term.</p><p>

In the most immediate, I think we can look to the current expansion of civil society as a positive new avenue for deepening our democracy. Democracy is, fundamentally, about people being involved in politics, and that has been weakening for many decades, both from the top (voter suppression, lobbyists, etc.) and from the bottom (apathy, cynicism, etc.) in ways that interact.</p><p>

It would be lovely if, going forward, some of the energy and renewed interest got channeled into structural and systemic ways to increase and enrich participation. Some of that should be legal – so, real pushes on voter rights and enlarging the franchise (for example, to felons) – but some of it can be less formal, around norms instead of laws.</p><p>

For example, we’re seeing a lot of amazing engagement at congressional town halls, and there’s a risk there that politicians will start avoiding the town hall format. Making sure that it’s an expected norm for politicians to participate in unfiltered town halls throughout both campaigns and terms could become important. We also really need to find ways to expand civic knowledge, from a basic level of how our (partial) democracy works through media literacy.</p><p>

Longer term, I’d like to see more creativity and experimentation focused on improving our democracy. As I said above, we see some of that happening in the private sector and sometimes in local governments, both here and abroad, but at a large scale it’s going to be difficult to push through significant changes, because the system is designed to prevent them.</p><p>

There’s some merit in that—think about how difficult policy and policy evaluation is made when we change direction every four years—but also a lot of risk in missing chances to improve, or save, or democratic principles.</p><p>

<b>What is micro-democracy? How is the political future depicted in <i>Infomocracy</i> structured? Is it purely a thought experiment or is it a concept you want to see implemented?</b></p><p>

Micro-democracy (in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/12/microdemocracy-is-a-high-tech-solution-to-americas-current-system/" target="_blank">my definition</a>; there are others) is a system of government that shrinks the population for the basic jurisdictional unit; in theory this lessens the risks of oppression by majority, since smaller groups are more likely to find common ground and majorities are likely to be less overwhelming. Note that it doesn’t solve the problem, although the overall system also favors relatively free immigration, which will also help.</p><p>

The micro-democracy in <i>Infomocracy</i> is based on units of roughly 100,000 people each. So imagine if those county-based electoral maps you see with scattered dots of blue and red were actually maps of two different countries with different laws, budgets, governments.</p><p>

In <i>Infomocracy</i>, however, these units have far more choice. There are some 2000 governments worldwide, offering different collections of policies and laws. So someone living in Boston could be a co-citizen, living under the same system of government, with people living in Oslo and in Dakar and Hue, while their neighbors a couple of blocks over in Boston might have an entirely different set of laws and leaders.</p><p>

This may sound farfetched, but in fact similar set-ups exist today, in places like Alaska and Gibraltar and Réunion, although those are determined by the history of colonialism rather than by choice. We can also look at urban areas or rural counties that comprise several municipal governments, in which driving over an invisible boundary gives you different traffic laws, school systems, and local taxes.</p><p>

My purpose was never to propose micro-democracy as the single best way to evolve democracy, although I do think it has a lot of …</p></div></div>

    <p>On Sunday July, 12 2020 at 06:00 UTC I sent myself three SMS messages through the International Space Station’s APRS digipeater. Here’s how I did it, but first a little background on my motivation for this project.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.kj7nzl.net/img/aprs/aprs-iss-sms-0001.webp" alt="Confirmation of SMS messages forwarded by ISS."> <figcaption>

</figure>

<h2 id="why-even-bother">Why Even Bother?</h2>
<p>The ISS has carried an amateur radio payload since its early beginnings. Part of this payload includes a radio that serves as a digipeater for APRS. Hams within the footprint ISS as it orbits can send and receive data packets containing messages that can be used to make contact with each other. There exists a number of various stations transmitting during any given pass. Some of these stations are just automatic beacons transmitting ever few minutes and some are actually other hams trying to make contact through the ISS. It’s been my experience in my location within the United States that there have been mostly automated stations clogging up the airwaves with there stupid beacon transmissions. As a result trying to make a contact with another human through the ISS has been fruitless. As a result I wanted to make use of the ISS’s digipeater as it traversed through space over my home. One day I discovered you could send SMS messages using APRS to the SMSGTE station. This station was attached to the internet and acted as a gateway for SMS messages onto the cellular networks. Curious I tried sending a message to myself with terrestrial stations receiving my transmission and routing my data packets onto the SMS gateway. Honestly, this was intriguing for only a minute or two since terrestrial stations are relatively common and the process was no more difficult than sending a SMS using my cell phone. One night while trying to establish a contact through the ISS’s digipeater with another human (Seriously, is there anyone in the Mountain West area besides me even attempting ISS contacts?) I had the brilliant idea of sending myself a SMS message through the ISS. It’s hard enough actually having your beacon APRS packets heard by the ISS, so I figured why not up the difficultly level by trying to send myself a message. Besides, I have to do something on those solitary nights when the ISS is flying over my house.</p>
<h2 id="aprs-sms-gateway">APRS SMS Gateway</h2>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.kj7nzl.net/img/aprs/aprs-sms-flow.svg" alt="SMS message flow between ISS and mobile phone."> <figcaption>
            <p>SMS message flow between ISS and mobile phone.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The glue that hold this whole experiment together are APRS Satellite I-Gates and the SMSGTE APRS cellular gateway. Without these two an APRS packet could not be relayed by the ISS and sent to my phone. APRS Satellite I-Gates listen on the 145.825 Mhz frequency for APRS packets that are relayed by the ISS as it flys over. These packets are then routed through the APRS network to SMSGTE gateway, onto a SMS cellular gateway, and finally through the cellular network to my phone. To use the SMSGTE gateway, it’s relatively straightforward. All you need to do is transmit a message to SMSGTE in the following format: <code> @&lt;number&gt; &lt;message&gt;</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">To: SMSGTE
@1235551234 Hello from space! </code></pre></div>
<p>When the message is delivered, it will be display on the mobile phone like so:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">@KJ7NZL-6 Hello from space!</code></pre></div>
<p>This is all you really require do to start using the SMSGTE gateway, but if you want to mask a person’s phone number within your APRS packets you can achieve this by using an alias. You can set these up by registering as user on <a href="https://smsgte.org/">smsgte.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sending-a-sms-message-through-the-iss">Sending A SMS Message Through the ISS</h2>
<p>The key to sending a SMS message through the ISS is preparation. For me a Typical ISS pass for me is about six minutes and thirty seconds long. In that time I have to locate the ISS, queue up my message to the SMSGTE gateway, and transmit my message to the ISS. I don’t have a fancy setup with an azimuth and elevation rotor and circular polarized beam antennas; I’m merely working with my trusty Yaesu FT3D and handheld Arrow II antenna. As a result it takes a minute or two find the ISS and you can easily loose track of it while navigating through the menus on the FT3D with one hand. To help shortcut some of the process I actually construct the message on the FT3D prior to the upcoming ISS pass and transmit on 145.825 MHz just before the ISS appears on the horizon. Since this message isn’t received by anything an acknowledgement isn’t sent to the FT3D. This adds the message to a queue of unsent messages the FT3D will try a resend after a minute or two. I’m able to manually try and resend these messages while they are in the queue. This allows me to focus on tracking the ISS while barely needing to check the radio’s screen, only needing to for a few seconds at a time to make sure I click on the message transmit button. Once the ISS receives my APRS message a confirmation message from RS0ISS will display on my screen and I’ll receive the SMS message on my phone a second or two later. This sounds relatively straightforward, but in practice it took me a few weeks of trying to get the process down.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>Now that I’ve accomplished my goal of sending a SMS through the International Space Station’s APRS digipeater, I need to try something new. When I sent my first messages I used five watts of power. The lowest power setting on my FT3D is 300 milliwatts, and I’m curious to know if I can actually reach the ISS with that little amount of power. I believe it’s possible, but I’m going to need to make sure I’m aiming my antenna directly as the thing as it passes overhead. The next goal I have is to actually reply to my SMS message once it’s received. This may be more difficult if not impossible. It’s possible to reply to an SMS message and receive the response as an APRS packet from your radio. However, I’m unsure what digi path the SMSGTE gateway uses, but I suspect it’s not setup to relay packets to the ISS. Even if it were, this may require me to be under the same ISS footprint as the SMSGTE gateway. I’ll have to reach out to the owner of the gateway to find out more information.</p>

<p><strong><span>A Tale of Two Charts</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows the monthly average <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin">price of bitcoin</a> since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1238" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-26/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png" data-orig-size="782,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-26" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png 782w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px"></figure>



<p>This second chart shows the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=bitcoin">Google Trends Score</a> by month for the search term “bitcoin”, also since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1239" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-27/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-27" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>When I first saw the second chart, I thought it looked remarkably similar to the first. Sure enough, it does. Below are the two charts together. The darker line shows the price according to the left-side axis and the lighter line shows the Google Trends Score according to the right-side axis.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1240" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-28/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png" data-orig-size="783,306" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-28" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>It turns out that bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score are quite correlated.</p>



<p>Specifically, they have had a 72% positive correlation since October 2013. This compares favorably to bitcoin’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-correlation-with-gold-is-weakening-says-new-kraken-report">26% correlation with the stock market and 24% correlation with gold</a> over the last year.</p>



<p>I should note that the correlation between bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score was much stronger up until both price and score peaked in December 2017 (98%) than it has been since (59%).</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the purpose of this analysis is not to argue about the level of correlation nor to assert causation one way or another (though it seems logical that the price and popularity feed off of each other). Rather, the purpose of this analysis is to make a speculative projection regarding what bitcoin’s price could be if and when its popularity (as measured by its Google Trends Score) returns to and surpasses its previous all-time high.</p>



<p>In order to make this projection, we first must consider the historical ratio between bitcoin’s average price and its Google Trends Score on a monthly basis. Let us refer to this as the <em><strong>price:score ratio</strong></em><strong> </strong>for short.</p>



<p><strong><span>Bitcoin’s Price:Score Ratio</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows how bitcoin’s price:score ratio has increased over the last several years.</p>

<p>For a ratio that has been relatively volatile historically, it has remained unusually consistent for the last two months (June &amp; July) at 729, just 4% short of its all-time high of 758 in November 2019.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s price:score ratio has been above 645 for 9 of the last 12 months after having only reached such a level once before, and barely (646 in October 2018).</p>



<p>The 3 months in the last year during which the ratio was lower than 645 can be fairly easily explained. They took place this past March, April, and May as hype grew in anticipation of bitcoin’s once every four years halving event on May 11, 2020. Additionally, people perhaps were searching more than usual for information about alternative assets (including bitcoin) when the stock market crashed ~30% in the early days of the lockdown resulting from the pandemic. Those two factors together seem sufficient to explain the uptick in bitcoin’s Google Trends Score over that period. On the other side of the price:score ratio, bitcoin’s price fell along with the market, and so with the price going down and the score going up, the decreased price:score ratio over those few months makes sense.</p>



<p>Since the stock market substantially recovered and the halving event came and went without materially moving bitcoin’s price, the Google Trends Score has returned to the pre-pandemic, pre-halving-hype range. For the last two months (June &amp; July), bitcoin’s monthly Google Trends Score has stayed steady at 13, which is equal to its average from April 2018 (after the peak) through February 2020 (before the halving hype and market crash).</p>



<p>For some additional context, it should be noted that bitcoin’s Google Trends Score has only been equal to or greater than 21 in 7 months since bitcoin’s inception and they all took place consecutively surrounding bitcoin’s last major surge from September 2017 through March 2018 (with scores chronologically of 21, 22, 44, 100, 55, 39, and 23).</p>



<p><strong><span>Flying Under The Radar</span></strong></p>



<p>Sufficed to say, bitcoin’s average score of 13 since the last surge, excluding the three aforementioned months from earlier this year (14 if we include them), shows objectively that bitcoin is flying under the radar (in terms of its popularity as a search term at least). Of course, it may not seem this way to people who follow crypto closely and daily but the algorithmic and mass-data collecting Google Trends Score should be trusted over any single person’s speculative and subjective observation about the current level of hype and attention.</p>



<p>If you, like me, believe that bitcoin is and has been flying under the radar for more than two years now, the natural question to ask is this. What do we expect to happen when that is no longer the case? In other words, what happens to bitcoin’s price if and when it reaches the pinnacle of its next hype cycle? How high might bitcoin fly the next time we see a situation similar to that of December 2017?</p>



<p><strong><span>Projecting Bitcoin’s Price</span></strong></p>



<p>I believe a reasonable response to this question can be made by applying bitcoin’s average price:score ratio over the last twelve months (643) to a Google Trends Score of 100 to estimate what bitcoin’s price would be if the price:score ratio stays about constant and bitcoin’s popularity in terms of search returns to its all-time high. The price implied by this projection is about $65,000 as is demonstrated by the maximum value in the top right corner of the chart below. Basically, if one believes that bitcoin will at least at some point return to the level of popularity it attained in December 2017, this methodology would lead that person to expect bitcoin to attain a price of at least $60,000 at that time.</p>

<p>This estimate can be made less conservative in two ways. The first is to assume that the price:score ratio will continue to increase as it has all along (6% month-over-month), rather than calculating the price using the LTM average of the ratio. The second is to assume that bitcoin’s popularity as a search term will well surpass its previous all-time high set in December 2017 just as that all-time was more than twice as great as any high before it and more than 8 times greater than the all-time high before May 2017 (which was set in December 2013, perhaps not coincidentally exactly 4 years or one halving period prior to the latest all-time high). I hesitate to call either of these two less conservative assumptions aggressive because they are not only reasonable but actually probable if one is to simply assume that the historical trends will continue in terms of the score and the ratio.</p>



<p>As such, I will close by presenting a chart which one can use to approximate the price implied by their own inputs for the Google Trends Score and the price:score ratio. In this chart, I show the ratio for the last 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and so on, and use the average year-over-year growth rate between those figures (16%) to project the next twelve months (“NTM”), next two years (“N2Y”), and next three years (“N3Y”) ratios.</p>



<p>The highest price projected on the chart is right around $300,000 based on a Google Trends Score of 3 times the previous all-time high (300) and a projected N3Y price:score ratio of 996 (the LTM average of 643 increased 16% 3 times for 3 years). Of course, this maximum price projection is limited only arbitrarily by the maximums I have decided to present on this chart for both the score and the ratio.</p>

<p><strong><span>To Be Continued…</span></strong></p>



<p>Many people have employed many methodologies in attempting to accurately project bitcoin’s price. For example, <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD">PlanB</a>‘s stock to flow ratio looks at scarcity to make one of the more convincing price projections I’ve seen. My price:score ratio looks at popularity in endeavoring to do the same. This analysis was not intended to be totally comprehensive. My intention was merely to introduce this methodology for others to critique. As such, my hope is that this becomes widely enough read so that I may receive ample critical feedback for further consideration and refinement of the methodology.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what motivates software developers. If
you believe that <a href="https://thenewkingmakers.com/">Developers are the new
Kingmakers</a>, then this is an important subject!</p>
<p>It's certainly true that developers can be opinionated, but I’m not sure I
agree with statements like the following;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[a developer] typically just wants to use the best
tool for the job”<sup>1</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout my career I’ve seen it over and over that developers want to
reinvent the wheel instead of talking to another team, or using a pre-existing
solution. Sometimes it seems like the primary goal of developers is to find
excuses to write a lot of code. There are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boondoggle">so</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">many</a>
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/">examples</a> of developers picking things that let them
muck around with code, instead of making the best choice for the business.</p>
<p>Code, rather than results has this mythical status in the industry. Candidates
for highly-paid developer jobs, like the one I used to hold, are tested on
their coding ability first, and other skills second. These skills, like
communication, and listening are often derisively referred to as soft skills.
I've seen interview debriefs where interviewers act like being able to code
trumps all other skills.  The reality is that those "soft" skills are the most
important skills, and they only get more important as you progress in your
career. The technical leaders that I admire the most, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOYdKht1YwE">James
Hamilton</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc6X3sj6q8">Heidi
Howard</a> are great communicators
above all. Those are the people who change industries, and upend the
<a href="https://fortune.com/2015/10/21/hp-public-cloud/">status</a>
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2013/10/29/ibm-capitulates-amazon-gains-cia-contract/#60d44d204bbf">quo</a>.</p>
<p>So why is it code and coding that holds this mythical status? Why are all the
hopeful university and bootcamp graduates studying <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Coding
Interview</a> in the hopes of landing
a six-figure salary at a tech company?</p>
<p>Two things finally made it click for me. Firstly, I listened to a podcast
about achieving <a href="https://anchor.fm/curiousclimberpodcast/episodes/Cameron-Norsworthy---The-Path-to-Flow-eboqkc">flow state, and how it applies to
climbing</a>.
Secondly, I finally watched the 1995 cult-classic Hackers. In that movie, the
main character Dade is basically addicted to his computer. He stays up all
night, much to his mother’s distress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the
zone, is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully
immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in
the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by the complete
absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of
time. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Hacking movie collage" src="https://blog.drgriffin.com.au/hacking-collage-v2.jpeg">
A selection of scenes involving coding, or 'hacking', from War Games, Hackers,
The Matrix , Swordfish , The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, and Halt and Catch
Fire.</p>
<p>People like me love to deride ‘hacking’ scenes in hollywood movies as being
unrealistic.  But after watching Hackers I realised... I have behaved like
Dade, many times; and not just recently during this
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6344-time-is-an-illusion-lunchtime-doubly-so">pandemic</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Me playing my GameBoy" src="https://blog.drgriffin.com.au/gameboy.jpeg">
That's me engrossed in a GameBoy sometime in the 90s.</p>
<p>When I think about it, that search for flow has had a huge impact on my life
and career. It was while I had some spare time<sup>2</sup> as a ski-bum that I
did Zed Shaw's <a href="https://shop.learncodethehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard
Way</a>.  That, along with my Electrical
Engineering degree is what lead me down the path towards Amazon, and Seattle.
You could argue that I spent two (Australian) summers as a ski-bum, and learned
a new programming language in search of that flow state.  Some other examples
of things I've done over the years perhaps in search of flow are sailing,
hiking, climbing, and weightlifting. In that context, those hollywood scenes of
caffeinated hackers staying up all night don't seem so far off the mark.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about a stereotypical software developer, what were they
like as a child? Did they love LEGO? Did they play computer games? Did they
read lots of books? Are they into comic books? Did they excel at math? The list
goes on.</p>
<p><img alt="My first lego set?" src="https://blog.drgriffin.com.au/bob-lego-and-me.jpeg">
How many engineers began their journey with a set of LEGO?</p>
<p>It turns out that the people who defined and researched flow, like Mihaly
Csikszentmihályi, and Jeanne Nakamura outlined some specific conditions that
need to be met to achieve the flow state, again from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Wikipedia</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and
   progress.  This adds direction and structure to the task. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback. This helps the
   person negotiate any changing demands and allows them to adjust their
   performance to maintain the flow state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One must have a good balance between the perceived challenges of the task
   at hand and their own perceived skills. One must have confidence in one's
   ability to complete the task at hand.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These principles have been used pretty heavily by games, and the techniques of
game designers are now common in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">everyday
life</a>, sometimes with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/06/its-no-accident-that-facebook-is-so-addictive/">questionable
outcomes</a>.
But bringing it back to developers, many things you can see in the software
industry look like attempts to find flow.</p>
<p>Firstly, a clear set of goals and progress?  Hello <em>tasks</em>. From Agile,
to Scrum, to Kanban, most software development methodologies are built around
the <em>task</em>.  <em>Tasks</em> are created precisely to set goals and measure progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, feedback. One of the key things that attracted me to software, over
the other branches of electrical engineering was the immediate, almost
addictive feedback loops you can get while coding.</p>
<p>And thirdly, endless ink has been spilled over the years about aligning
challenges with skills. Every discussion you’ve ever seen about organizational
structure has some element of trying to align the challenges of the
organization with the skills of it's people. All the work I've done around
mentoring and growth, from when I was a 14 year old Patrol Leader in Scouts, to
Amazon, was about finding the right level of challenge for people.</p>
<h2>Maybe they weren't crazy after all</h2>
<p>So now when I think back to my first job, the way I ended up owning a bespoke
"distributed lock service" built on top of NFS<sup>3</sup> makes much more
sense to me. It makes sense why my predecessor chose to build this instead of
using some simpler, or off-the-shelf solution. When Csikszentmihályi describes
flow state as the “optimal experience”, he's giving us a clue. People probably
aren’t optimizing for making money, or increased feature velocity, or more
reliable software, or better customer experiences, and your employees are
especially not optimizing for shareholder value. People are optimizing for
their <em>own</em> happiness, which often involves finding ways to reach a flow state.
Of course, often we pop out of that state to align our work with the customer,
with making money, or other external factors. Just like whales, we must come up
for air. But people certainly enjoy it more when they get to spend as much time
as possible approaching flow.</p>
<p>Hopefully by now you’re convinced that the flow state, or optimal experience is
a real thing, and that many developers are searching for this state through
coding. Being in a state of flow has the potential to make people both happier,
and more productive. If you’re an employer, it can be a win-win.</p>


<p>But I'm not (currently) an employer. Although I am building some things aimed
at developers.</p>
<h2>Can we design for flow?</h2>
<p>I think the answer is yes. A slightly bolder claim would be that developers
only truly <em>love</em> products that help them reach a state of flow.</p>
<p>There are two extremes from which developers will critizise most products. Some
lucky products manage to get both criticisms at the same time.</p>
<p>The first is if the product is incomplete, too low-level, or difficult to use.
This often results in large amounts of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:yak_shaving">yak
shaving</a> to get anything
useful done. You can't get into a flow state if you're staring into the
abyss of errors, or constantly having to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>. Here are some examples of things
that fit into this category, from my personal experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuration languages like CloudFormation, or TerraForm.</li>
<li>Compiling from source (think Linux WiFi and graphics drivers<sup>4</sup>).</li>
<li>Deciding which of the 200+ AWS services are right for my use case.</li>
<li>Programming in assembly (Motorola HC11) at university many years ago.</li>
<li>A certain internal Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">tool</a>, that I can't
  name for fear of breaking my NDA (and also causing PTSD in current and former
  Amazon engineers reading this).</li>
</ul>
<p>The other extreme from which developers will critizise products is being too
high-level, restrictive, or not having enough options. You can't get into that
flow state if you don't get to engage your brain! As an example, the Wikipedia
page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework#Rationale">software
frameworks</a> has
some hilarious "<em>[citation needed]</em>" back-and-forth about the pros-and cons of
frameworks. The interesting thing is that <em>both sides</em> of this debate want to
write lots of code and be productive. They're just looking at it differently.
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY">OG framework demo</a> was all
about how quickly you could start writing code. Meanwhile opponents of
frameworks say that they spend more time learning how to use the framework than
coding. </p>
<p>Another area where I wonder if the products are too high-level, or restrictive
is the so-called <em>NoCode</em> space.  There are a bevy of well-funded startups,
like AirTable, ReTool, and Webflow that claim to eliminate the need for coding
to build websites. The thing is, I have tried a couple of them, and the UIs
aren't as intuitive as you might hope. I also can't imagine myself achieving a
state of flow with them. I've spent many, many hours in my life writing things
like this blog post, or programming in Java and Python. To me, graphical UIs
don't get you that feeling of <em>building</em> that you get from typing at a command
line, or even typing up a document.</p>
<p>I can imagine people reaching a flow state if they're really proficient users
of, say, Photoshop. But I'm not sure that these NoCode tools encourage the high
level of mastery that a professional photographer, or editor might have. As
such, while they're interesting tools, I struggle to see them catching on in a
way that justifies the kind of valuations that VCs are looking for.  But it's
still early in this space, the jury is still out.  Maybe I'll …</p></div></div>

All while charging an arm and a leg that piles debt on them.</p><p>It has hurt everyone, with the exception of a few tenured literary critics who get increased status, and the CEOs of conglomerates, who get more resumes to choose from.</p><p><span id="more-1765"></span>Federalization is about imposing a dominant ideology and worldview, and in the case of our educational policy it is about imposing “front rowness”— the idea that everyone should aspire to becoming a tenured professor or a widget engaged in a resume arms race with the rest of the world.</p><p>It is a system built by intellectual elites who want everyone to be like them, and humiliates everyone else. It is a system that says anything that can’t be learned in an advanced placement class isn’t that important, like being a good member of the community, or family, or church. Those things are impediments to success. Staying home to care for your parents rather than rushing off to Princeton is an unnecessary speed bump on your way to having your best career!</p><p>Those who fundamentally don’t buy into this ideology, which is most of the working class, end up sitting in the back row of whatever school, distracted and frustrated. Throwing spitballs at whoever because they don’t take easily to set theory, or Algebra, or Henry James or Nathaniel Hawthorne. Because they don’t enjoy memorizing whatever they have to memorize for the next standardized test.</p><p>They are kids who just want to learn a skill to get a job. Because they are really good with their hands and good with tinkering, always have been. Or they are really good with animals, or good at getting stuff to grow, or they have ‘always been good at caring for people, noticing when someone is a little off and need to be checked on. Like, I always been good that way, especially with my Grandma, who shines up when she sees me come to play checkers. So maybe I will go into nursing you know. But I keep getting D’s in math and history, but if I can get over that hurdle, I sure would love to be a nurse.’</p><p>What we need is an educational system that values these kids’ particular world view, their particular skill set, their particular interests, and encourages and trains them in it. The back row kids who are not great at test taking and who don’t really want to go to college. So they can stay close to their parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, and eventually make a decent enough wage to buy a Tundra, a home, start a family, go to church, and eventually host the weekly backyard get togethers their cousins, aunts, uncles, nieces, friends come to. All without being sneered at as a dumb, uncurious, closed-minded provincial hick or hoodlum, because Shakespeare ain’t their thing.</p><p>Right now they are sneered at, directly and indirectly. The whole system is constantly probing, measuring, and gauging them. Constantly making them jump over one standardized hurdle after another, and sneering when they fall. So when they finally put it all behind them (thank god!), if they bother to focus on politics at all, they aren’t going to embrace the same group of people pushing the same policies that made them take test after test after test, while telling them their C’s and D’s were because they needed more self discipline, more curiosity, more openness, and more interest in the scientific method. You simple minded kid, vote for me!</p><p>Ahead of them, at the front of the classroom, are the clever curious kids who love running off to the library to read whatever and memorize whatever else. For twelve years they are in heaven because we have built a system for them, that embraces them, encourages them, and then whooshes them off to college, and then more college, and then even more college! But when they eventually emerge, maybe after graduating from 19th grade, they discover that although they were the best debater in Portsmouth, Ohio, and at Kenyon College, and one of the better thinkers in grad school, they are only the 75th best debater vying for that one job in Manhattan or that one tenure-track position at Columbia, and the poorest of the 200 people vying for that third-floor walk up in Williamsburg.</p><p>So the dream that everyone from their Head Start teacher to their high school guidance counselor, to their literary or intellectual hero on YouTube urged them to follow, of running off to see the world while making a difference, isn’t going so well, and now they are deep in debt from the last masters program that was supposed to make the difference and solve all of this.</p><p>Rightfully frustrated, they are now doing what they have been trained to do all their life, which is embracing politics and arguing, loudly and forcefully, to change the world. Which mostly means tinkering with the system that produced them, rather than tearing it all down. Because that is what they know.</p><p>So they focus their energies into making the system less painful, to them and their university friends. Like getting rid of college debt, or building more affordable apartments in Williamsburg, or providing more affordable public transportation because they take the damn subway every day and it is fucking crowded.</p><p>Some of them recognize that maybe we should throw fewer resources at education, maybe we should funnel fewer people into Philosophy PhD’s, and fewer young professionals into Williamsburg. Certainly their working class Brooklyn neighbors whose rent is skyrocketing agree with that.</p><p>These aspirational professionals running from one adjunct gig to the next have my complete sympathy, regardless of the policies they want changed, as do their back row counterparts running from one fast food gig to the next. Both have been chewed up and spit out by a system that chews up and spits out a lot of people. Just in different ways.</p><p><img src="https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1724-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="822" height="548" srcset="https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1724-300x200.jpg 300w, https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1724-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1724-768x513.jpg 768w, https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1724-1536x1025.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px"></p><p>Yet it is the kids sitting in middle row I have the deepest sympathy for because they are the most harmed, and the ones you hear the least about. They are mostly working class kids who don’t really fit into the back row because they are very disciplined, eager, and want do what they are told, and especially want to do the right thing. Which now means going off to college to better themselves, so they go off to college to better themselves, regardless of the cost.</p><p>They buy into our faux educational meritocracy the most, swallowing it hook, line, and sinker. They buy the dream peddled by every successful person they have ever run across or heard, from Obama down to the middle school guidance counselor: Education is the pathway to a successful and meaningful life.</p><p>So they work super hard to get A-’s and B+’s in their classes and 80’s on standardized tests, and then take the next step and go off to the the best college available.</p><p>But they don’t really fit into the front row either, because they don’t know anybody who has ever been to college. Not their parents, or grandparents, or uncles or aunts. Not even a cousin. But all of those relatives are encouraging, even giddy about the idea. They want the best for their child, so they help them apply, to the degree they can help. And when the acceptance letter comes from that far away college with ivy covered buildings (oh my god, real ivy, just like in the movies!), they are so happy they throw a party, complete with mylar balloons, and post the picture on Facebook or Instagram.</p><p>They are a little shocked when they see that the cost is like 40K a year, which is a super lot of money, more than dad makes, but mom makes some money too, and they will figure it out, because their wonderful child is going to have the American Dream.</p><p>So they apply for loans and eight years later that child is a young adult with 100K in debt working in a government bureaucracy five hundred miles away and missing the weekly family backyard BBQs .</p><p>Or maybe it didn’t work, and they are back home in the job they would have gotten straight out of high school, but now four years behind in seniority and 20K in debt.</p><p><img src="https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1200-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="838" height="558" srcset="https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1200-300x200.jpg 300w, https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1200-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1200-1536x1025.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px"></p><p>Education is wonderful, so is bettering yourself by getting as much of it as possible. But done on your terms and because you want it for your reasons. Not because you, your community, and everyone else you know, is competing with the Chinese, or the Germans, or the Indians. So you have to take countless standardized tests so you can win a golden ticket to ship off to Princeton and hang with others who are good at taking standardized tests, to then be taught more stuff, to then go to grad school to learn even more stuff, so you might, if you are lucky, get to go to San Francisco and live in an a small room hundreds of miles from your family to start in a firm trading bonds, or helping Google sue someone, or running from teaching one introductory writing course at one school to another introductory oratory course at another school, or maybe so you can write papers for a non-profit funded by a billionaire arguing that we need more education. That isn’t good.</p><p>What we have now is a top-down educational system that intellectually strip mines America and humiliates everyone. What we need is a democratic educational system that provides pathways to dignified lives for everyone. That provides Shakespeare and differential topology to those who see the beauty of each, but also provides skills to those who would rather focus on things like music, mechanics, nursing, parenting, farming, or whatever.</p><p>We need educational freedom, not educational colonialism.</p> <p><a href="https://americancompass.org/the-commons/">Return to the Commons</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>Building a culture of belonging is vital to the success of any organization. Efforts to make companies more diverse and more inclusive have a profound impact on shaping culture for the better.</p><p>But for most, the sudden changes to working environments due to COVID-19 have disrupted these efforts. Many leaders are trying to understand how to maintain the momentum of their diversity and inclusion programs, and how they can recalibrate to this new normal and even accelerate progress.</p><p>To help leaders and teams find success here, we invited industry luminaries Nicole Sanchez of <a href="https://vayaconsulting.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Vaya Consulting</a> and Ellen Pao of <a href="https://projectinclude.org/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Project Include</a> to join Range co-founder Jennifer Dennard for an online discussion (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OwawfySY59imwnNsBK9hM_a6cfhCTUz11qEkAHFuCyY/edit#slide=id.p" rel="noopener" target="_self">slides here</a>). During this webinar, our speakers explored:</p><ul><li>The state of diversity and inclusion in the workplace</li><li>The future of diversity at work</li><li>Fostering inclusion</li><li>Building on today’s momentum</li></ul><p>Here are some of the highlights of what we learned over the course of the discussion.</p><h2><strong>A greater purpose fuels today’s diversity and inclusion efforts</strong></h2><p>Given all of what’s been happening in America today, it comes as no surprise that there is a renewed interest and focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace. As Nicole sees it, we go through this every few years. However, one big difference this time around is that, thanks to the Black Lives Matter movement, champions for diversity and inclusion don’t have to spend as much time explaining and justifying the work they do.</p><blockquote>I think people feel the pain of what it means to get it wrong inside their organizations. And they are either surprised or pleasantly relieved to find out that there are people who work on this full-time. —Nicole Sanchez</blockquote><p>It’s because of the moment — this period in time where we’ve been more vigilantly focused on racial injustices — the conversation is landing differently with predominantly white leadership. But it’s not just them.</p><p>“I would also add that white employees are hearing it differently, too,” Ellen shared. “Not just the management, but the employees. And they’re speaking up.” As a result, management isn’t getting away with employing the same old tactics of donating money or making a statement. Employees are voicing their unhappiness, causing companies to look inward and fix their own issues.</p><h2><strong>Getting DEI right isn’t just going to happen on its own</strong></h2><p>For many of us, working from home every day of the week was thrust upon us. And not surprisingly, many of us — individuals, teams, and organizations — were not prepared. Some of our lives are just not set up for that. Some of our colleagues need to commute into a shared workspace to get work done, while some of us are thriving while working from home. With this in mind, Nicole notes that “As we figure out how to reassemble a workforce, we have to remember that nothing is automatically better.”</p><blockquote>The other thing that’s going to happen is that as we hire people from parts of the country where the cost of living is lower — and that increases our racial and ethnic diversity — we have to remember to not reproduce redlining in our own companies. —Nicole Sanchez</blockquote><p>There are a lot of things companies have to balance in the name of equity and inclusion if diversifying via a remote workforce is going to be a strategy. “It’s not simple, and we cannot assume our companies are going to be automatically good at it without putting the resources in.”</p><p>Jen, who wears many hats at Range, including people operations, has found it interesting to see the dialogue happening within many companies around equal pay for equal work. When we ask “How do you have a financially responsible balance sheet and pay people fairly?” we have to consider diversity and inclusion if we hope to come up with an equitable solution. They are not two separate topics and recognizing this reality changes how we approach the challenge.</p><h2><strong>How to build diversity into your hiring practices</strong></h2><p>For a long time, a lot of the dialogue around diversity and inclusion has been about finding ways to promote equal access and opportunity. While the dialogue today has shifted to “You’re either racist or anti-racist,” equality remains a top goal. As Jen points out, as companies work to develop programs that are anti-racist, some are running into legal constraints (i.e., establishing hiring quotas for individuals belonging to groups not well-represented within a company). So, she asked how companies can build diversity into the hiring process without running into legal trouble.</p><p>“There are a bunch of ways to do it that don’t run afoul of the law,” says Nicole, “and actually uphold the spirit of trying to diversify, especially around race and gender lines.” Here’s what she recommends starting:</p><ol><li><strong>Get clear about your values and value proposition for diversity</strong> (i.e., identify what you hope to gain by diversifying that you couldn’t have otherwise had)</li><li><strong>Start with improving racial and ethnic diversity</strong>, as it’s the hardest for most companies, and once you get it right it becomes easier to attract folks</li><li><strong>Widen the definition of what “good” looks like for your company</strong></li></ol><h2><strong>You need support from the very top</strong></h2><p>Prioritizing and improving diversity and inclusion at your company is the responsibility of <em>everyone</em>. And yes, having an executive leader (a Chief Diversity Officer or Chief People Officer) specifically focused on DEI 100 percent of the time is important. However, at the end of the day, the person who is ultimately responsible for this work is the CEO.</p><blockquote>At the end of the day, the person who is ultimately responsible for inclusion work is the CEO. And if the CEO is inclusive and cares, you will have an inclusive company. If the CEO has delegated because they don’t care, you will not have an inclusive company. —Ellen Pao</blockquote><p>Employees look at how their CEO makes decisions. When bad behavior is overlooked and excuses are made, the importance and value placed on DEI is undermined, and it’s undermined from the very top.</p><h2><strong>Building on today’s momentum</strong></h2><p>While sheltering-in-place has caused us all to reevaluate how we approach our diversity and inclusion work while working remotely, America’s continued national focus on issues of race has generated momentum enough to enact long-lasting change within companies.</p><p>The response from the C-suite today on these issues is markedly different from what it was in the past. Not only are the voices of employees being heard, but their messages are landing differently with executive leadership. So how do you capitalize on that opportunity?</p><ul><li>Revisit the values of your company, and update them if necessary</li><li>Stop focusing on growth regardless of the cost</li><li>Establish committees focused on support diversity</li><li>Push for changes to how your company recruits and interviews</li><li>Consider how you can track D&amp;I work as a business metric</li></ul><hr><h2><strong>Resources shared during the webinar</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OwawfySY59imwnNsBK9hM_a6cfhCTUz11qEkAHFuCyY/edit#slide=id.p" rel="noopener" target="_self">Webinar slides</a></li><li><a href="http://thereadyset.co/blog/social-justice-anti-racism-and-blm-resources" rel="noopener" target="_self">ReadySet’s Social Justice, Anti-Racism, and #BLM Resources</a></li><li><a href="https://projectinclude.org/recommendations/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Project Include Recommendations</a></li><li><a href="https://firstround.com/review/eight-ways-to-make-your-dandi-efforts-less-talk-and-more-walk/" rel="noopener" target="_self">First Round’s 8 Ways to Make Your D&amp;I Efforts Less Talk and More Walk</a></li><li><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/blog/diversity-inclusion-equity-differences-in-meaning/" rel="noopener" target="_self">General Assembly’s The difference between diversity, inclusion, and equity</a></li></ul></div></div></section></div>]]>

The change has been really positive: It’s a privilege to lead an organization that truly <a href="https://cloudfour.com/believes/">believes in the web</a>.</p><p>But big changes have a way of destabilizing one’s work-life balance. This became especially clear to me when, later that year, I returned to my sketchbook after an unintentionally long absence.</p><p>Drawing was a struggle. Nothing came out right. Glaring down my nose at the page, a slow sense of panic set in. I’d spent thirty years drawing nearly every day… had I really squandered all that in only a month or two away?</p><h2 id="skills-can-atrophy">Skills Can Atrophy</h2><p>A lot of people scoff when I tell them anyone can draw with enough practice. “I can barely draw a stick figure,” they reply. “I could practice every day and I’d never improve.”</p><p>But they’re wrong. Talent may be a factor, but I <em>know</em> it’s mostly practice.</p><p>I know because when I stop practicing, I get worse at it.</p><p>It isn’t like riding a bike. It’s like trying to write with the wrong hand. You <em>know</em> how the words are supposed to look, you <em>remember</em> how they’re written, but your digits are clumsy and uncooperative.</p><p>Drawing’s been my most direct form of self-expression for as long as I can remember. It’s the starting point of every website, app, game, icon or presentation I’ve ever made. To pick up a pen or pencil after months away and feel that sense of disconnect between my thoughts and gestures was truly alarming.</p><p>Luckily, I had an idea for how to fix it.</p><h2 id="discipline-restored">Discipline Restored</h2><p><a href="http://www.atinyrocket.com/">Erika Lee Sears</a> is a painter based here in Portland.

    <p>My colleague
<a href="https://twitter.com/jyasskin/status/1288308864786419713">Jeffrey Yasskin</a>
asked an interesting question on Twitter:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://emilymstark.com/assets/jyasskin_pake_tweet.png" alt="Tweet asking why we advise developers to use password hashing functions instead of PAKEs to check the password without sending it">
  <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Jeffrey is referring to Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocols.
PAKEs allow two parties to negotiate a cryptographic key based on a password,
which might be known by one or both of the parties. When people talk about using
PAKEs in the web setting, however, they usually aren’t directly interested in
negotiating a cryptographic key. Instead, they’re interested in using a PAKE to
authenticate a user, and they’re specifically interested in PAKEs because some
PAKEs allow a client to prove to a server that the client knows the correct
password without revealing the password to the server. In contrast, when using
traditional password-based authentication, the client sends the password to the
server, and the server compares it with a value stored in its database
(hopefully hashed with a strong password hashing function).</p>

<p>Not sending the password to a server is appealing for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The server can’t leak the password if it never sees the password. In
traditional password-based authentication, we partially mitigate this risk by
hashing the password when it’s stored in a database, so that a database breach
won’t leak the password. Some developers worry about leaking passwords before
they reach the database – for example, passwords might get accidentally
written to frontend log files that get leaked – and using a PAKE could
mitigate this risk.</li>
  <li>A malicious server can’t steal the password if it never sees the password.
However, this goal is irrelevant to Jeffrey’s question about web apps
implementing PAKEs. The web server provides the JavaScript code that
implements the PAKE, so a malicious server could just steal the password
directly on the client. (However, it is interesting to think about how the
browser itself might intervene to stop malicious servers from obtaining the
password; see <a href="#browser-mediated-pakes">Browser-mediated PAKEs</a> below.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If web apps were to use PAKEs, the security gain would be via the first
property: the server can’t leak the password. My position is that PAKEs provide
a very marginal security gain in the web app setting (funnily enough, many years
ago I was to <a href="https://twitter.com/estark37/status/1288319710744834049">blame</a>
for exorcising one of the few PAKE implementations on the web), but to argue
that position coherently, I first need to discuss why web developers care about
leaking passwords in the first place.</p>



<p>I’m not talking about <em>how</em> we hash passwords – e.g., which password hashing
function to use, how many rounds, etc. I’m talking about a much more basic
question: why do we bother hashing passwords rather than just sticking them in
the database like other data? (Sidenote: I think this would make a great warm-up
interview question for a security engineer… of course now that I’m blogging
about, I won’t be able to use it.)</p>

<p>At first glance, it might seem obvious that websites hash passwords so that a
database breach doesn’t yield long-term access to all the site’s users’
accounts. But, if an attacker gains read access to a website’s database, the
attacker can likely leak session cookies or other bearer tokens as well as all
the other sensitive user data that the website handles. The main reason we hash
passwords is to mitigate users’ tendency to reuse passwords across different
services (in other words, to protect against
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing">credential stuffing attacks</a>
in which a leaked password at one service is reused at another). If a website’s
database gets breached, it is a catastrophic security incident for that website
regardless of whether the attacker leaks plaintext passwords or other data. But
if the attacker leaks plaintext passwords, the breach is also a catastrophic
security incident for other websites. The value of hashing passwords is to
prevent a security incident at one service from spreading laterally across huge
swaths of the web.</p>



<p>That’s why my answer to Jeffrey’s question was that, in the web setting, PAKEs
don’t buy you much that client-side password hashing doesn’t also buy you (and
client-side password hashing is much simpler). Both protect against credential
stuffing attacks in the event of any server data leak, which, as I argued above,
is the main threat that password protections aim to mitigate. A PAKE is stronger
in that it prevents a server data leak from yielding long-term access to users’
accounts. In contrast, leaked client-side-hashed passwords do give the attacker
access to users’ accounts on that service, because the hashed password
effectively is the password. But I just don’t find that very compelling in light
of all the other interesting data (session cookies, sensitive user data, etc.)
that an attacker would be able to access with a server data leak.</p>

<p>This is not to say that I recommend client-side password hashing – just that
any web developer considering implementing a PAKE should take a close look at
their threat model and consider if client-side hashing is a much simpler way to
get what they want. Personally I’d recommend that web developers focus their
cycles on moving users towards stronger auth in the form of
<a href="https://webauthn.io/">WebAuthn</a>, rather than investing in either a PAKE or
client-side password hashing.</p>



<p>Reasonable people can disagree on the answer to Jeffrey’s question, and another
reasonable answer might be “historical accident.” PAKEs were patent-encumbered
for some period of time, and some had <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/should-you-use-srp/">less than ideal security
properties</a>.
Furthermore, until the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">WebCrypto</a> API
came along and offered native implementations of cryptographic algorithms to
JavaScript, implementing a PAKE would have involved hand-rolling cryptographic
primitives in a slow language that isn’t particularly well-suited to it. So it
could be that the advice to use a strong password hashing function took root in
the web developer community and wasn’t easy to overturn once
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/163.pdf">stronger PAKEs</a> and native crypto
implementations came along.</p>



<p>PAKEs don’t provide protection against malicious servers in the web setting,
because a malicious server could serve evil JavaScript that reads the plaintext
password off the page as the user is typing it. This problem invites an
alternative design to implementing a PAKE in JavaScript. What if the PAKE was
implemented in the browser itself and exposed via JavaScript API, with
trustworthy browser UI collecting the password from the user so that malicious
JavaScript can’t steal it?</p>

<p>At first glance, a browser-mediated PAKE appears to be a powerful anti-phishing
tool as well as a protection against server data leaks. But there are some
problems with this idea:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It poses a usable security and ecosystem challenge. The vast majority of
websites would have to migrate to the browser-mediated PAKE in order for users
to get out of the habit of typing passwords directly into webpages. Otherwise,
users wouldn’t notice anything amiss as they type their password directly into
a phishing webpage, even if the victim website used the browser-mediated PAKE.
Even if all websites magically migrated away from plaintext passwords to a
browser-mediated PAKE, a phishing website could likely convincingly spoof the
browser password entry UI to trick the user into typing the password into the
page, where it is accessible to JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Historically, browser-mediated authentication hasn’t seen widespread adoption
on the consumer web. Browser developers tend to view
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic Auth</a>
as legacy cruft that we’re stuck with due to entrenchment in enterprises. The
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Credential_Management_API">Credential Management API</a>
was a more recent attempt, and not many websites use it. I’m not sure why this
is<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, but one hypothesis is that web developers don’t like to have the
browser mediate user authentication and prefer to integrate it into the look
and feel of their website. <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID">WebID</a> is a
brand-new attempt aimed at moving federated login into the browser to prevent
cross-site tracking, so it will be interesting to see if and how that gains
adoption.</li>
  <li>If we could solve these usable security challenges, particularly the challenge
of training users to not type passwords directly into webpages, then browsers
could defend against phishing with much simpler means, e.g. by getting users
to log in to websites exclusively using a password manager that refuses to
fill credentials on the wrong sites. The marginal value of adopting PAKEs then
reduces to the same question I discussed above: is the complexity of a PAKE
worth the benefits in the event of a server data leak when you consider all
the other sensitive data that could be leaked?</li>
</ul>

<p>One final approach I’ll mention: TLS includes
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-barnes-tls-pake-04">PAKE ciphersuites</a>.
One could imagine browsers using this feature as a way of implementing a
browser-mediated PAKE. I think this is unlikely to achieve widespread adoption
in browsers and web servers, or solve any of the security problems I’ve
discussed. It suffers from all the usability and adoption challenges I just
mentioned, plus it’s implemented at the wrong layer for web applications:
TLS-terminating frontends don’t typically know about application authentication
state. Similarly, TLS client certificates aren’t widely used outside of
enterprises (though client certs suffer from other problems that further inhibit
their adoption). I think TLS PAKE ciphersuites are probably designed for
non-browser use cases.</p>

<p>Overall, one can construct various theories as to why web apps don’t implement
PAKEs, but my personal theory is that the marginal security gain is just not
worth the effort and complexity, and I predict that we won’t see widespread PAKE
adoption on the web.</p>

July 31, 2020 | https://beesknees.games/blog/a-web-developer-walks-into-a-game-jam | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://beesknees.games/blog/a-web-developer-walks-into-a-game-jam">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <p>Here's a super hot take for ya: making video games is hard, especially when you're new to it. Even though we each have a decade of experience developing software and we picked the simplest possible idea, it still took us multiple months to finish <a href="https://beesknees.games/blog/our-first-little-game">our first little game</a>!</p>

<p>As we started planning for our next game, we realized there was one big unknown floating around: how much had we actually learned from building Boba Simulator 2020? We certainly <em>felt</em> like we'd learned a lot, but we couldn't quantify it. We started Bee's Knees Games with the assumption that our years of development experience would allow us to pick up game development more quickly, but with only a single point of reference so far, we weren't sure if we'd need to reevaluate our various business timelines to account for a longer ramp-up time.</p>

<p>Right around this time, <a href="https://pigsquad.com/">Portland Indie Game Squad</a> announced an upcoming game jam: <a href="https://itch.io/jam/ssjturnbased">Summer Slow Jams 2020</a>. We'd never done a game jam before, we both love turn-based games, and we were excited to use everything we'd learned on Boba Simulator 2020 to build another quick game and compare the development processes of the two games. We felt like finishing a second small game would give us a much more concrete idea of our ramp-up time, and allow us to estimate the development time of our next game with greater accuracy.</p>

<p>In case you'd just like to play: we ended up creating a game with <a href="https://twitter.com/alexbenson">Alex Benson</a> called <a href="https://beeskneesgames.itch.io/oxo"><strong>OXO</strong></a>!</p>

<p><img src="https://bees-knees-games-blog.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image-uploads/promo-screenshot-1596067670064.png" alt="OXO screenshot"></p>

<p>You can <a href="https://beeskneesgames.itch.io/oxo">download OXO on itch.io</a>, and if you stick around, you can read our thoughts on the development.</p>

<h2>We got an idea for a gardening game</h2>

<p>The initial game jam announcement said that all games must be turn-based, but they didn't announce the creative theme, so we started a brainstorm on what types of things we'd like to see in a turn-based game. As the Bee's Knees Games CPO (Chief Plant Officer), Jessica immediately gravitated towards a gardening game, where weeds spread every turn and you have to prune them before they overtaking your garden.</p>

<p>We got very excited coming up with different ideas for weed-spreading algorithms and the pruning tools that you could use. We also felt like we could pretty easily swap gardens and weeds for a lot of other possible themes (a virus spreading across a network, a fire spreading through a forest, etc.), so we felt comfortable thinking deeply about the idea even without knowing what the creative theme would be.</p>

<h2>We got extremely lucky</h2>

<p>A couple days before the official start of the game jam, <a href="https://twitter.com/alexbenson">Alex Benson</a> reached out â€“ he's a 3D animator and musician who had also never done a game jam and was looking for a team to join. We'd nervously agreed on doing the graphics and music ourselves, but when Alex reached out, we felt so lucky. I mean, just check out his <a href="https://stuffalexmakes.com/">work</a>.</p>

<p>Not to spoil the rest of the blog post, but Alex was an amazing teammate. We'll go into greater detail later, but it's hard to imagine the game we all made together without Alex's artwork and music. Alex brought a style and a level of quality to the project that ultimately let us go far beyond what we thought we could accomplish in two weeks.</p>

<h2>We got our creative theme</h2>

<p>A few days later, PIGSquad announced the creative theme: "alternate timelines". The three of us met on Discord and discussed whether our initial weed-spreading idea was adaptable or not.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we decided our game would have a whole multiverse of different timelines, and the walls between the timelines would be breaking down, and the player's job would be to fix the cracks between the timelines before the whole universe collapses in on itself. Which, if you think about it, is pretty much just pruning weeds with some fancy shaders.</p>

<h2>We organized ourselves</h2>

<p>While we were still unsure on how well our web development experience was translating to game development, we knew how to organize ourselves when developing software, and we felt confident that this knowledge would work well for game development. We used:</p>

<ul>
<li>A GitHub repository for version control.</li>
<li>A Trello board for tracking work and sharing assets.</li>
<li>A Discord channel for synchronous communication between the three of us. We'd normally use Slack, but Discord is better when collaborating with someone outside our company.</li>
</ul>

<p>These tools worked great for us, and we'd highly recommend them to other teams participating in a game jam.</p>

<h2>We started building the game</h2>

<p>With our team organized and our game idea laid out, we started work on the actual game. Our first task was planning a simple very simple version of the gameplay to get the game's foundations in place. In web development, we call this concept "minimum viable product" (MVP for short), and we felt like this idea would translate well to game development.</p>

<p>We started work on our MVP by brainstorming about how the timeline damage would spread across the board, and what options the player would have for fighting it. We did our earliest prototypes using some super high-tech tools:</p>

<p><img src="https://bees-knees-games-blog.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image-uploads/postit-board-1596067798934.jpg" alt="Prototype using post-it notes"></p>

<p>This was super useful for quickly figuring out what options might make sense and ruling out non-starters. After a couple hours, we took what we'd learned and started coming up with algorithms that would translate well to a computer.</p>

<h3>The damage spread algorithm</h3>

<p>We wanted the timeline damage to start out feeling minor, but to get "out of control" as it spreads across the board. To enable this, we came up with an idea we called "damage heads".</p>

<p><img src="https://bees-knees-games-blog.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image-uploads/damage-spread-1596068647567.gif" alt="Damage spread GIF"></p>

<p>On turn 1, there is a single damage head in a corner of the board. Every turn, this head moves to a random adjacent cell, leaving behind a trail of damage on all the cells it previously touched.</p>

<p>Alone, this simple algorithm never gives the feeling of the board getting out of control, since only one new cell is damaged each turn. However, we also included a second rule: every 3 turns, all damage heads split in two.</p>

<p>This gave us the feeling we were looking for. Now, if you dilly dally around fixing up damage without a plan, the damage heads will grow exponentially and you won't be able to fix things fast enough. This algorithm evolved to be a bit <a href="https://github.com/beeskneesgames/June2020Jam/blob/43b63d5859db938136e41d7b1fc632a61be81a61/Assets/Scripts/DamageManager.cs#L47">more complicated over time</a>, but its roots remained the same.</p>

<h3>The player's options</h3>

<p>We decided to start the player out with just two simple options: "move" and "fix". The player gets three "action points" per turn, and can spend them moving to a different cell, fixing the damage on a cell, or some combination of the two. Moving and fixing cost the same amount: one action point per cell traveled. For example, fixing (or moving to) the cell directly on your left costs one action point, while fixing the cell that's two steps to your left costs two action points.</p>

<p>While these options are extremely simple, we felt like they were great for an MVP, and we'd be able to expand on them later on. Like the damage algorithm, these rules evolved over time, and the final game has slightly modified rules. You can see our final rules list on <a href="https://beeskneesgames.itch.io/oxo">the game's itch.io page</a>.</p>

<h2>We built a solid foundation and iterated on it</h2>

<p>With only two weeks to build the game, it was tempting to start hacking something onto the screen right away and throw any semblance of foundational planning out the window. However, we still decided to still spend some time building a solid foundation. We really wanted to build something that was at least somewhat fun, and we knew this would require a lot of tweaking of various aspects of the game (board dimensions, action point costs, etc.). Our experience with web development taught us that small tweaks like this are easy in a well-architected system, but in a hastily-thrown-together one, each tweak can take a very long time. We predicted that spending some up-front time on architecture would save us time in the long run, and we turned out to be right. Here are a couple examples of this foundational work.</p>

<h3>The grid. A multi-coordinate-system frontier.</h3>

<p>All game logic took place on a square grid, which meant the game would inherently contain two coordinate systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Unity coordinate system, which gives each object a 3D floating point coordinate specifying where that object lives in the scene. An object living in the absolute center of the scene has a Unity coordinate system position of <code>(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)</code>, while an object that's supposed to be 2.5 meters above the center will be at <code>(0.0f, 2.5f, 0.0f)</code></li>
<li>The grid's own coordinate system, where each cell has a 2D integer coordinate. On our 16x16 board, the bottom-left cell has a grid coordinate of <code>(0, 0)</code>, while the bottom-right cell is at <code>(15, 0)</code>, and the top-right cell is at <code>(15, 15)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We knew we'd need to do a lot of translations between these two coordinate systems. For example, if we wanted to move the player from cell <code>(2, 2)</code> to cell <code>(2, 3)</code>, we'd need to figure out the Unity coordinate system position for each of those cells, so that we could animate the movement between them correctly. Our experience building Boba Simulator 2020 taught us that we really want to limit how much Unity position math is spread throughout the system, so we decided to encapsulate all the coordinate system translation logic in our <a href="https://github.com/beeskneesgames/June2020Jam/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Grid.cs">Grid</a> class. Much of this work was done by the <a href="https://github.com/beeskneesgames/June2020Jam/blob/43b63d5859db938136e41d7b1fc632a61be81a61/Assets/Scripts/Grid.cs#L329-L331"><code>Grid.PositionForCoords()</code></a> method.</p>

<p>For example, instead of manually calculating the player object's Unity position during a move, we can just call <code>Grid.PositionForCoords()</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/beeskneesgames/June2020Jam/blob/43b63d5859db938136e41d7b1fc632a61be81a61/Assets/Scripts/Player.cs#L316-L317">player movement method</a>, and then do a <a href="https://github.com/beeskneesgames/June2020Jam/blob/43b63d5859db938136e41d7b1fc632a61be81a61/Assets/Scripts/Player.cs#L321-L327">simple lerp</a> between the positions. This lets us keep the translation math out of the Player code entirely.</p>

<h3>The debug menu</h3>

<p>Early in the development of Boba Simulator 2020, we found that we had certain parameters we wanted to tweak frequently during development. Once this became bothersome enough, we added a "debug mode" that would toggle between debug-friendly values and the values we intended for players. For example, the tapioca balls in the game should normally fall randomly across the screen, but this made it slow to test the ball-catching logic, so we made the tapioca balls fall down in a straight line in debug mode. This toggle proved useful in Boba …</p></div></div>

Changing all the patterns you are used to from the office as an employee/manager is never easy. </p> <p>When I moved a startup to be completely remote as its CTO in 2015 I discovered the hard way that I had to change how I personally communicate and how the team communicates. I had to adopt new ways of team bonding, conveying company culture, etc. </p> <p>For remote work to be effective every aspect had to be fundamentally different. One example is the need for <a href="https://snir.dev/blog/remote-async-communication">written async communication</a> which I wrote an extensive essay about. </p>  <p>When I tell people remote will work much better if everyone is remote, I get called dogmatic. “It’s not all black and white”. I’m sure some companies will be able to roll out hybrid models, but they need to know what they lose. </p> <p>Remote work practices are so fundamentally different from the office, that using a hybrid model of some people remote some are in the office will eventually lead to 2 separate companies within the company. </p> <p>The remote company communicates through written communication, so their work is transparent and easily accessible to everyone. The office company relies on meetings and in-person talk, so their work is inaccessible and making the remote employees left out. </p> <p>The remote company relies on online activities to get to know and trust each other, which the office people can take a part of too.

Don’t leave anyone behind. One way around it that seems to work well enough though, is logical separation by departments. </p> <p>For example - having all the R&amp;D working remotely, and all the sales in office. This still works as it does not stifle the progress of someone within his department and unify the communication methods within each department. </p> <hr> <p>There’s a lot more to be said on the topic and the implementation details.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes I would get some interesting questions from my friends about internet security, such as whether it is possible to leak the bank account password when logging to the online bank via an untrusted network, whether it is possible that the message you received from someone via an untrusted network got modified maliciously, and whether it is possible that someone pretends to be you and send messages in your name. My answers to those questions are as long as your computer and cell phone are uncontaminated they are almost impossible thanks to our modern public-key crytosystems and digital signatures.</p>



<p>There are a couple of introductions to the public-key crystosystems and digital signature available online. However, I think most of them are incomplete or hard to understand. In this blog post, I am going to describe the public-key crystosystems and digital signatures using extremely simple math, so that there would be no ambiguity at all.</p>

<h3 id="usages">Usages</h3>

<p>The modern cryptosystems are public-key encryption systems in which everyone has a public-key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public-key is seen by everyone, but the private is only accessible by the owner. The public-key encryption systems could also generate digital signatures which could be used to verify whether the message you received is unmodified and truly sent from the sender.</p>



<p>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a typical algorithm for the public-key cryptosystems used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. However, we are not going to introduce the RSA algorithm in this blog post. Instead, we would describe the public-key cryptosystems and digital signatures at a high level.</p>

<h3 id="essential-features">Essential Features</h3>

<p>Each user has their own encryption and decryption functions, $E$ and $D$, using public-key and private key respectively. We use $M$ to represent the message to be encrypted and sent. There are four features that are essential to a public-key cryptosystem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decrypting an encrypted message gives you the original message (Of course!). Specifically,</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>Encrypting a decrypted message gives you the original message (Hmm…). Specifically,</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>$E$ and $D$ are easy to compute. This means the encryption and decryption process should be fast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$. This means you could hardly find a way to decrypt the encrypted message, even if you know how to encrypt the message.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We would ignore how to satisfy the four features in this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="message-encryption-and-decryption">Message Encryption and Decryption</h3>

<p>Suppose we have two people, Alice and Bob. Both of them are using the same public-key cryptosystems. This means Alice and Bob both have their private keys stored secretly and have their public key published to some authorities. From the authorities, we could find the public keys of Alice and Bob unambiguously. We denote encrypting the message using Alice and Bob’s public keys to be $E_A$ and $E_B$ respectively, and decrypting the message using Alice and Bob’s private keys to be $D_A$ and $D_B$ respectively.</p>



<p>One day, Alice wanted to send a private message $M$ to Bob. Alice found the public key of Bob, encrypted the message $M$ using Bob’s public key. The encrypted message for Bob is denoted as $C$.</p>



<p>Once Bob received the encrypted message $C$, he could decrypt $C$ using his private key.</p>



<p>Even if the network was compromised and someone intercepted $C$, it is still almost impossible to decrypt $C$ because of that $D_B$ is unknown and the feature “the publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$” for public-key cryptosystems.</p>



<p>The message content is safe because of the public-key encryption systems. However, it does not provide any assurance about the sender. For example, James could send Bob a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, encrypt it using $E_B$, and send it to Bob. If there is no author verification procedure and Bob is not careful enough, Bob might actually think the message is sent from Alice. In some other scenarios, James might have intercepted the encrypted message $C$ sent out from Alice to Bob, prevented the message transmission to Bob, replaced the original message to $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, encrypt it using $E_B$, and send it to Bob. Bob might also be convinced that the message content $M^\prime$ was actually the original message Alice has sent. Specifically,</p>



<p>Digital signatures, derived from the public-key cryptosystems, are designed to solve these authentication problems.</p>

<h3 id="digital-signatures">Digital Signatures</h3>

<p>In addition to the encrypted message $C$ that Alice sent to Bob, Alice would also have to send her digital signature $S$ to Bob. Namely,</p>



<p>Alice could find $E_B$ using Bob’s public key and $D_A$ using her private key.</p>



<p>Once Bob received both $S$ and $C$, he could decrypt both $S$ and $C$ using his private key and Alice’s public key. Specially,</p>



<p>We found actually the two decrypted messages from $S$ and $C$ are exactly the same. This is expected if the message was sent from Alice and the content of the message was not modified. Let’s further see what will happen if someone pretends to be Alice to send a message to Bob, or the content of the message has been modified.</p>



<p>James, again, wanted to send Bob a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, or had intercepted an encrypted message $C$ from Alice, blocked it and created a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice. To make the message readable by Bob, James encrypted $M^\prime$ using $E_B$, send the encrypted message $C^\prime$ to Bob.</p>



<p>Because Bob does not accept any message without a signature, James had to make up a signature. However, because James knew nothing about Alice’s private key, he used a decryption function $D_J$ which is different from Alice’s secrete $D_A$. The signature James generated would be</p>



<p>Once Bob received both $S^\prime$ and $C^\prime$, he could decrypt both $S$ and $C$ using his private key and Alice’s public key as usual. Specially,</p>



<p>In this case, Bob would see the two decrypted messages are not the same. Bob would then realize that there is something unusual happened and he should not trust anything about the message.</p>

<h3 id="hacking-the-public-key-cryptosystems">Hacking the Public-Key Cryptosystems</h3>

<p>As long as the four features of the public-key cryptosystems hold, cracking it is almost impossible. If somedayy, when the almighty quantum computer is available, the feature “the publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$” would be compromised, therefore the modern public-key cryptosystems would no longer be reliable. I may talk about this topic in the future.</p>



<p>There is another way to send fake messages to Bob in name of Alice, without using a quantum computer. If James could somehow crack the account name and password of Alice on the web application, replace the Alice’s public encryption function from $E_A$ to $E_J$, when Bob tried to retrieve Alice’s encryption function, he would get $E_J$ instead of $E_A$. The decryption of signature $S^\prime$ would become $M^\prime$ instead of $M^{\prime\prime}$ then. Concretely,</p>



<p>In this case the two decrypted messages match. Bob would be convinced that the message is from Alice and it has not been modified.</p>



<p>It should be noted that James was replacing Alice’s public encryption function from $E_A$ to $E_J$, instead of replacing his private decryption function from $D_J$ to $D_A$. In principle, $D_A$ would only be kept on Alice local computer and not anywhere else. Even if James has Alice’s account name and password on the web application, he would not get a copy of $D_A$ unless he specifically hacked Alice’s physical computer.</p>



<p>This reminds us that actually keeping our password safe is the most important.</p>

Trancept Systems Inc. was founded in January 1986 by Tim Van Hook, Mary Whitton,
and Nick England. Our goal was to develop a flexible, user-programmable, high performance
graphics and imaging accelerator for computer workstations.&nbsp; <p>

In the Spring of 1987 we introduced the TAAC-1 (Trancept Application
Accelerator) product for Sun Microsystems
workstations. The TAAC-1 consisted of two sandwiched PC boards, one full of video
RAM, the other full of a micro-programmed wide-instruction-word (200 bits)
processor optimized for graphics and imaging operations. The TAAC-1 was plugged
into and memory mapped onto the Sun's VME bus. The TAAC-1 was probably the world's first board-level GPGPU product.
Tim Van Hook was the chief architect and hardware designer and also wrote a ray
tracer and lots of other software for the processor. Paul Ramsey created the C
compiler and other tools that we used for creating TAAC programs. </p><p>

We had a brief but exciting life as a start-up company, developing the hardware
and demo software during 1986, introducing the product at the NCGA conference
in Spring 1987, and selling ourselves to Sun Microsystems in May 1987. At the time, Trancept consisted of the original trio
plus 7 other talented (and brave) souls who'd joined our start-up effort.
</p><div><p>The TAAC-1 continued to be marketed by Sun for several years and I'd guess almost 400 TAACs were sold. Sun's North Carolina
group went on to develop the <a href="http://www.graphics-history.org/trancept/sunvision-01.pdf"> SunVision</a> visualization toolkit, the <a href="http://www.graphics-history.org/trancept/mvx.htm">VX/MVX
accelerator</a>, and various video capture and compression boards before Sun
pulled the plug in 1994. </p><p>

There were lots of great people who were part of Trancept and Sun's North
Carolina group and we had lots of great (and patient) customers.&nbsp;Thanks
for the wonderful experience!</p></div>

<p>
Lots of interesting and innovative code for the TAAC-1 processor got developed
by Tim Van Hook and other sharp Trancept and Sun folks, including:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    anti-aliased ray tracer
  </li><li>
    real-time 2D electric potential field simulator
  </li><li>
    real-time 2-D FFT
  </li><li>
    real-time image decoding animation (DCT before MPEG)
  </li><li>
    an extensive real-time 3-D graphics library
  </li><li>
    an extensive image processing package
  </li><li>
    volume rendering and other visualization tools
  </li><li>
    Renderman(tm) compatible photo-realistic renderer
</li></ul>
<p>
We provided customers with a C language microcode compiler and were strongly encouraged
(!) to develop their own code. They came up with all sorts of interesting
and imaginative ways to use the TAAC-1.<br>

  <div><p>A lot of people write about chess as having an opening game, a middle game and an endgame. When you're playing is that what's going through your head?</p></div>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>Everyone has an opening repertoire. Many people just have one answer for each question they might reasonably expect their opponents to ask, which means they get very good at playing those answers, but equally become very predictable. There are some openings that are razor sharp and precise, and require knowing many 15-20 move variations in order to not get destroyed without the game even starting. I personally prefer openings that are more conceptual, which tend to be slightly more flexible, require much less knowledge, but arguably lead to somewhat more boring positions because of this.</p></div><div><p>So when the middlegame comes around, it's probably the kind of position I've played many times before. My strategy is usually to throw lots of pieces at their king and hope they die or I can win some material. Since I'm hoping to win at this point, I probably don't start thinking explicitly about the endgame until little suggestions of things that might become relevant start cropping up. So if pawns become isolated or doubled, or we end up with opposite colored bishops, or with a bishop on the same color square as most of our pawns, etc. If I can take one of these small positional advantages then I will, and then effectively "bank" it until the endgame actually comes around. Having one or more of these might make me more likely to head towards an endgame too.</p></div><div><p>Endgames are really hard and require a lot of technique that I don't really have. Fortunately most other people don't either, because you just don't get to play that many of them.</p></div><div><p>It probably is fair to say that I'm pretty aware of the opening/middlegame/endgame distinction. The opening is where I'm playing pretty much from memory, the middlegame is where I try and win, and the endgame is what I might head towards if I think I have a tangible advantage but try and avoid otherwise.</p></div>

          <div target="spkr-color-">
            <div><div>
  <div><p>So when you say that the endgame is what you might head towards - is the endgame not just the 'end of the game'? In which case won't most games have one? I know in the extremely amateur world of chess that I play in that most games come to a end where one side is actively checkmated. Is the endgame more unusual the higher up you go because a party will often resign when one side is in a dominant position?</p></div>

          <div target="spkr-color-">
            <div><div>
  <div><p>I guess this is a question for statistics to answer properly, but my gut says that there possibly are fewer endgames in higher level play. If you lose a bishop or a knight without any obvious compensation, you will almost definitely resign on the spot. That said, it's probably also true that fewer boneheaded mistakes mean that neither side may have had much of a chance to win before the endgame. Overall I'm not sure!</p></div><div><p>But when I say "might head towards the endgame", I mean that I might deliberately choose to swap off pieces and accelerate progress towards the end of the game. If I'm a pawn up then trading off pieces is likely a huge win for me, because whilst a queen + 2 rooks + 1 bishop + 2 knights + 7 pawns v the same but 6 pawns is not a huge advantage, a bishop + 5 pawns v a bishop + 4 pawns probably is. Small material advantages are a much bigger deal in the endgame and leave less room for your opponent to generate compensation, so if you are slightly ahead then deliberately swapping off pieces is very important. Games can naturally meander towards an endgame where neither side is too psyched about their chances, or they can be forced.</p></div>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>Honestly I like openings that allow you to put your pieces on nice squares without thinking too hard, and then throw them all at your opponent's king. This is not a very sophisticated strategy, but it can be very hard to deal with if you aren't prepared (this is a good example). If you can get off the beaten track without doing anything too insane then you become much more familiar with the kinds of positions that result than your opponents, and develop a big box of patterns that have worked in the past.</p></div><div><p>This becomes somewhat less effective the higher level and more famous you get, as you start to become notorious for particular openings, and opponents can start preparing counters to them. This is where a degree of flexibility and unpredictability becomes invaluable, so that your opponents can't just put all their time into preparing for your Stonewall Dutch or Trompowsky, and also have to keep in mind that you might throw in a Benko Gambit or English Opening. It can be worthwhile playing these alternatives in high profile tournaments that will get their games into databases that your future opponents will see and get confused and upset by.</p></div>

As mentioned above, you don't necessarily need to be destroying or capturing anything in order for your pieces to be making your opponents' life awkward, so principles like "rooks on open files" will almost always be good things to at least look out for.</p></div>

<p>The term asynchronous means “not occurring at the same time” and in the context of distributed systems and messaging it implies that the processing of a request occurs at an arbitrary point in time. There are many advantages of asynchronous interactions over synchronous ones but also new challenges introduced by it. In this post, we will focus on a few specific considerations for choosing a suitable asynchronous messaging infrastructure for implementing <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/event-driven/" target="_blank">event-driven</a> systems. Let’s see a few of the subtle differences between asynchronous interaction styles.<br></p><h2>Message Business Value</h2><p>Not all messages are created equal. Some are valid and valuable only for a short period of time and obsolete later. Some are valuable until they are consumed regardless of the time passed. And some messages are valid and useful for repeated consumption. Considering the validity and the value of messages relative to time and consumption rate, we can qualify interaction styles between services into the following categories:</p><div><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p9AE1uCT-lY/XyQrM2kw2LI/AAAAAAAAOi8/9VSsF63jc_0u3NSab9nn5nYwCtS4fce_QCLcBGAsYHQ/s2576/business_value.png"><img alt="Message types by business value" height="136" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p9AE1uCT-lY/XyQrM2kw2LI/AAAAAAAAOi8/9VSsF63jc_0u3NSab9nn5nYwCtS4fce_QCLcBGAsYHQ/d/business_value.png" title="Message types by business value" width="400"></a><br><i>Message types by business value</i></p><h4>Volatile</h4><p>These are ephemeral messages where the value is time-bound. Valuable now, but not in the short future. There is no point in storing events that are useless in the future and using messaging systems with such characteristics gives the best performance with the lowest latency possible as the disk is skipped. In such a scenario, the system is aware of the connected consumers and the event disseminated to all consumers online at the time of publication. If a consumer is disconnected, the messaging system forgets about these consumers. What is important in such a system is the ability to handle a large number of dynamic clients with low latency interaction needs such as IoT devices.</p><h4>Durable</h4><p>However, in some situations you want the messaging system to be aware of the consumers and store the messages while the consumer is not available. That is a traditional message broker which will hold on to the messages for the consumers that he knows about and allow the consumers to re-connect and consume the events that were produced in his absence. Once an event is consumed by all the interested parties, it will discard the messages. Here the broker knows about registered consumers and messages are stored durably until read by all registered consumers. Here the goal is to do reliable messaging among services with strong ordering and delivery guarantees.</p><h4>Replayable</h4><p>Here, the messaging system is not aware of the consumers that are interested in the event. It simply stores the events published to a stream for some time or until capacity is reached. Then a consumer can come along at any time, connect and consume the events and perhaps replay the stream from the beginning. Consumers can move back and forth in the stream as required and replay the messages repeatedly. Here, the driving force is extreme scalability combined with the ability to replay messages for existing or new consumers.</p><h2>Message Semantics</h2><p>Apart from the technical characteristics of the messages, it is important to distinguish the language we use, the semantic aspects, and the intent of the interactions. Some messages are targeted for a specific consumer and demand concrete actions. Some are querying the latest state of a system without requiring a state change. And some notify the world about a change that has happened in the source system. From a messaging semantic perspective, there are the following types of messages:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RMxJzN21Bbk/XyQrihOt9FI/AAAAAAAAOjE/3jg_mU4oqN0WB1G8OOqQ43FC2JNmt5yMACLcBGAsYHQ/s2568/Screenshot%2B2020-07-28%2Bat%2B07.39.01.png"><img alt="Message types by semantics" height="135" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RMxJzN21Bbk/XyQrihOt9FI/AAAAAAAAOjE/3jg_mU4oqN0WB1G8OOqQ43FC2JNmt5yMACLcBGAsYHQ/d/Screenshot%2B2020-07-28%2Bat%2B07.39.01.png" title="Message types by semantics" width="400"></a><i><br></i></p></div><p><i>Message types by semantics</i></p><div><h4>Command</h4><p>A command is a request for action that usually leads to a state change on a known target system. Typically there is a response indicating that action was completed and even there might be a result associated with it. When a response is expected, commands are typically implemented over synchronous protocols such as HTTP, but it is possible to implement request/response or fire and forget style commands over asynchronous messaging systems. With a command based asynchronous messages, there is some coupling between the source and the target systems in the form of command semantics.</p><h4>Query</h4><p>A query is like a command, but it is a read-only interaction that does not lead to a state change. By its very nature, a query expects a response, and it is common to see synchronous implementations here. But asynchronous and non-blocking implementations over messaging systems and even fire and forget style interactions for long-running operations where a response is written to a different location are common too.</p><h4>Event</h4><p>An event is a notification that something has changed. A system sends event notifications to notify other systems for a change in its domain. An event is different from a command in that often the event emitting system doesn’t expect an answer at all. In addition to being asynchronous, event messages are not targeted to a specific recipient and thus, they enable even further decoupling. Similar to other asynchronous interactions, events are implemented as messages on queues, which are often called streams. Martin Fowler covers in-depth the different types of events in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0" target="_blank">this</a> talk.</p><h2>Summary</h2></div><div><p>One approach you can take is to follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank">Law of the Instrument</a> approach defined by Maslow as “If the only tool you have is a hammer, treat everything as if it were a nail." You could certainly use a classic message broker such as Apache ActiveMQ to implement the different interaction styles. It would be a familiar technology to many and easier to start with, but hard to implement some use cases such as replayable messaging. Or you could take the other extreme and try to use Apache Kafka for everything. It would require a larger amount of hardware resources and human effort to manage it, but it would cover the replayable messaging and extreme scalability needs. While both of the above approaches are fine to start with, when you have a large number of services with different messaging needs, using the right tool for the right job is a better option. We can map the above-described messaging patterns to see what messaging infrastructure is best suited for each.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MTuOiuBjh48/XyQr8TVfwuI/AAAAAAAAOjQ/JwY1yhgOkGY8l-upOVl2vqR9kvYdXh9tQCLcBGAsYHQ/s2768/Screenshot%2B2020-07-28%2Bat%2B07.39.17.png"><img alt="Mapping messaging subtleties to different messaging infrastructures" height="135" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MTuOiuBjh48/XyQr8TVfwuI/AAAAAAAAOjQ/JwY1yhgOkGY8l-upOVl2vqR9kvYdXh9tQCLcBGAsYHQ/d/Screenshot%2B2020-07-28%2Bat%2B07.39.17.png" title="Mapping messaging subtleties to different messaging infrastructures" width="400"></a><br><i>Mapping messaging subtleties to different messaging infrastructures</i></p><p>We at Red Hat love any open source technology.

      <p>This is going to be a practical overview of how I reduced the compilation time and binary sizes of Release Mode (-O3 or /Ox) C++ software. The goal of this will be to review some of the things that help with the goal, and some of the things that C++ as a language is fundamentally incapable of producing satisfactory answers to. Let’s<!--more--> dig in!</p>



<p>We were able to save some things for a project with 2.5K class bindings:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Version</td>
      <td>sol2</td>
      <td>sol3 (patron-only alpha)</td>
      <td>sol3 (now)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Build Time</td>
      <td>2 hours, 3 minutes</td>
      <td>2 hours, 11 minutes</td>
      <td>1 hour, 53 minutes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Binary Size</td>
      <td>119.0 MB</td>
      <td>138.0 MB</td>
      <td>103.0 MB</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>I added 3 new core template types that all abstractions get milled through. I also committed some of the sins below in improving the functionality and streamlining the code. To be honest, I’m actually surprised it only cost me 7 more minutes over sol2! But, let’s talk about the things I did in order to get to where we are now, and what I needed to identify as problem points…</p>



<p>This was a combination of intuition and empirical evidence. I had suspicions about what increased my compile time, but I did not want to go off on a wild hunt trying to figure out what was going on. Much as Templight and other tracers exist (and are <a href="http://aras-p.info/blog/2019/01/16/time-trace-timeline-flame-chart-profiler-for-Clang/">currently being worked on</a>) I kept my assumptions in the back of my mind but checked them by asking a few companies and individual users of sol2 to send me their largest object files VIA Discord and other means:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2019-01-19/biggest-you-have.png" alt="Mmmn, girthy."></p>

<p>In doing so, I could confirm my suspicions by seeing what was serialized into the object file. Note that while this does not perfectly translate to the final code (especially in release builds), it is a good proxy for (1) link times, due to having to resolve all of the (possibly non-unique) definitions from a single object file with all the others in the project; and (2) compile times, because the compiler has to vomit all of this stuff into these object files to begin with.</p>

<p>One of the object files I studied was 14 megabytes big from a Visual Studio 2017 Release build. the fun started when I expanded the <code>.7z</code> file:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2019-01-19/file-sizes.png" alt="Goodness...!"></p>

<p>Mama mia that’s a spicy 16.4x file size increase!</p>

<p>This is a screaming red flag that we have a LOT of redundancy (because it compresses so obscenely well under default settings). Duplicate symbols are rife in any TU that heavily uses templates, and sol3 <em>is</em> a template-heavy, header-only library. But, this probably doesn’t explain the absolute ballooning in size when going from the packed 7zip I was sent to the big thing in the actual binary.</p>

<p>To help me dig in, I <a href="https://twitter.com/chieltbest">relied on someone else</a> who did all the hard work for benchmarking what were the more expensive operations one could perform in relation to templates. I also use this brilliant person’s Rule of Chiel:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2019-01-19/rule-of-chiel.png" alt="The Rule of Chiel"></p>

<p>Armed with this knowledge and a bunch of object files, I set off to find the worst offenders in my code. I targeted what was either SFINAE + types, or SFINAE + function templates, since those were my typical things that destroyed my code. sol2 uses a lot of struct specialization SFINAE, which is probably the most damaging to compile-times right now. Coupled with some very gnarly function template SFINAE and other things, I figured that this and other things were probably the root of the cause.</p>

<p>Just where I found that bloat – asides from the obvious places where I used exactly those techniques – was even more of a surprise…</p>



<p>Lambdas are ultra convenient and – in some cases – even more powerful than structs you declare locally (for example, you can’t template function-local structs but you can do it with a lambda and <code>auto</code>/Concept function argument types!) But, I needed to tear them down in several places where I had capturing lambdas inside of templated code. I only did this in a handful of places – 6 or 7 total in the whole library, up from 1 or 2 in sol2 – and it did a fair amount of to save me the mental overhead when programming. They’re just Immediately Invoked Function Expressions, right? How costly can they be?</p>

<p>It turns out capturing Lambdas – even entirely local ones – don’t optimize out cleanly in terms of <em>code size</em> for C++ and a lot of it gets dumped into the object file and the resulting executable. I used <code>dumpbin</code> to get me all the symbols in a text file (an 11 megabyte text file) and then proceeded to just goof around and scroll through it. Some things there was nothing I could do about, like all the string spam for my Compile-Time Type Strings work I was doing. But, for this 1 object file where only 1 class was being bound using an alpha of sol3, I ran a count for the times <code>lambda</code> showed up:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2019-01-19/lambda-count.png" alt="Goodness Gracious..."></p>

<p>Sheesh… a few more pointed searches for certain identifiers with the lambda revealed that most of those belonged to my detail namespaces and inner workings. Remember, this is just for binding one class! All this symbol spam from the template-capturing lambdas revealed one thing, though: <em>each lambda, when inlined, results in a fat slab of code that is different per-instantiation</em> (I mean, duh, that’s the point of a template, right?). The compiler marks all of this code inline and dumps it into the resulting function instantiation, which is expected. The problem is that capturing all the variables in a templated function means that any time you have enough variable initializations and function declarations that depend on said templates, it is impossible for the optimizer to combine these bits of code together, even if its fundamentally the same code for all invocations!</p>

<p>The solution here was to roll up my sleeves and get out the dough, because it was time for…!</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/pexels/baked-baking-chef.jpg" alt="Only the best ingredients for your code base."></p>

</p>


<p>Since the 1990s, like your mothers and their mother’s mothers, and your fathers and their father’s fathers, I took to the oven to bake only the freshest lambda to trump them all, taking advantage of the fact that all of the routines were identical and that I could use some of Grandma’s <code>void*</code> and Great Aunt Mary’s function pointers. To top that off, Lua is a runtime ingredient so all the compile-time shenanigans weren’t exactly necessary at the point of my lambda. I lowered down my <code>if constexpr</code> spices into regular <code>if</code> statement herbs, powered by runtime booleans initialized with constant expressions. The result was a creamy yet spicy French struct with so many delicious members. Ultimately a reduction but the culinary blend saved me quite a bit of symbol spam in the object file and lambda-based template spew by quite a bit, making for some <em>chef kiss</em> nice improvements:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2019-01-19/artisanal-lambda.png" alt="Artisanal hand-crafted lambdas"></p>

<p>Food silliness aside, this helped a lot. To recap the point in a more clear way, though, here are some snippets illustrating the various degrees of (non-)trouble you can get yourself into.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>func</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>auto</span> <span>iife</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]()</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>/* work */</span>
	<span>};</span>
	<span>iife</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Also good:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>arg</span><span>,</span> <span>my_class</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>foo</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>auto</span> <span>iife</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>]()</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>/* work */</span>
	<span>};</span>
	<span>iife</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, but be careful…:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>T</span> <span>arg</span><span>,</span> <span>my_class</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>foo</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>auto</span> <span>iife</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>]()</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>/* work */</span>
	<span>};</span>
	<span>iife</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Worse:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>typename</span><span>...</span> <span>Args</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>func</span> <span>(</span> <span>my_class</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>Args</span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span>...</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>auto</span> <span>iife</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>]()</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>/* work */</span>
	<span>};</span>
	<span>iife</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Screaming in the distance:</em></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>Binding</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>binding</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>typename</span><span>...</span> <span>Args</span><span>&gt;</span>
	<span>void</span> <span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>my_class</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>Args</span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span>...</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>auto</span> <span>iife</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>]()</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>/* work */</span>
		<span>};</span>
		<span>iife</span><span>();</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, this is easy to see in these examples. But when working with complex template functions, it’s very easy to just make a fully-capturing lambda that gets you all the local variables and arguments you need with very little fuss. Just be careful if it’s a common use point in your API, and especially if there is a forwarding capture reference and you are expected to have string literals come into your API. String literals are actually the worst offenders for the bloat, because <code>"set"</code> is not the same type as <code>"super_set"</code> (they’re both different-sized C-style arrays).</p>

<p>Having a (imaginary) <code>std::c_string_view</code> or some <code>std::string_literal</code> <code>constexpr</code> type be the default here might help that out but I doubt the C++ Committee will ever bite on a <code>std::string_literal</code>-by-default type anytime soon. (After all, backwards compatibility etc. etc. – someone is bound to be broken if we change the fundamental type of <code>"blah"</code> in C++!) But, what may happen is a <code>std::string_literal</code> type that can <em>only</em> be created magically by the compiler. This will give us some interesting information to work with (read-only, string is interned, etc.), and from there we could probably at least fix some of C++’s strange warts, even if we still get <code>const char[N]</code> and <code>const char*</code> from template deduction and <code>auto</code>-deduction.</p>

<p>The point being, if you expect <code>my_template_f("blah")</code> to be a thing your users write, be careful!</p>



<p>Is anyone really surprised this shows up?</p>

<p>Parsing stuff in C++ is its own particularly special nightmare. I provided a <code>sol_forward.hpp</code> to ease on this parsing adventure. But I didn’t really put enough stuff in there. So I added some more forward declarations in there for sol3, and now the single header generates a proper <code>sol/sol.hpp</code> and a <code>sol/forward.hpp</code> for users to include. The result was pretty good gains:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2019-01-19/forward-declarations.png" alt="forward.hpp bringing huge benefits."></p>

<p>Forward declarations are good. Honestly, we should probably be providing very small Modules for the standard library, and also be providing incredibly fine-tuned headers too. <code>&lt;functional&gt;</code> alone is absolutely enormous, and it would be nice if we just had <code>&lt;functional_fwd&gt;</code> when we really don’t need the whole thing. I have some ideas in this space, but it’s going to take some time before I can let it manifest. (I have a lot to do over the next 3 years…!)</p>



<p>Tag dispatching – while a good technique – results in the compiler having to pick between overloads, even if its only 2. The worst part about any overload set is that the compiler cannot short circuit what it finds: it needs to walk over all of the possible function entities in an overload set before selecting the right one.</p>

<p>My tag dispatching code was …</p></section></div>

<p>For the past month or two, my brother, a friend of ours, and I have been working on creating a new board game. All three of us are extremely into board games and have always wanted to create one. It’s been really fun, but definitely not easy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When making a board game, there are a ton of edge cases and variables you have to consider. You have to run tests, fix issues and iterate on things that may need some improvement. This entire process made me realize that making a board game is a lot like writing software. It’s so similar in fact, that I believe creating a board game should be an activity done in schools to teach younger (and older) students the benefits of planning, thinking about edge cases, extensibility, iteration and probably more that isn’t popping into my head right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first step in board game creation was thinking of an idea and refining it into a general set of rules. This is very similar to software where once you think of an idea, you have to define a set of features and acceptance criteria. There are many things that we originally wanted to include but felt didn’t offer enough benefit, maybe even added confusion, so we left them out. We also had to think about whether the board game was fun at each step of the process, similar to thinking about if your software is adding value.</p>



<p>Once we had our general idea, we started thinking about edge cases. What happens if a player does this, what happens if they do that. In software you have to do the same thing. The difference is that in software (at least nowadays) you usually have the opportunity to go back and fix some of the edge cases after releasing it. With the board game, our goal is to fund it and release it. Once you release a board game, you can’t just patch it whenever you like. Any edge cases you may have missed are now there for people to run into (or exploit).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ok, so you finished writing your software… I mean… finished creating your first board game prototype. Now what? Well you have to test it. There’s no such thing as automated testing for board games, so you have to play test it. This is the most lengthy process of the creation process (At least so far. This is the stage we’re at now.). As you test, you’ll notice certain mechanics that don’t work, and have to patch them. This is similar to fixing bugs or improving on certain features in software.</p>



<p>Once you’ve finished play testing it and feel confident in your board game, that’s when you can start releasing it to the public. This requires you to write the rules in a way that is understandable to your target audience. Similar to software, documentation is very important. In software, documentation can take many different forms; API docs, instruction manuals, etc. Each of these documents has a different target audience and should be written with that target audience in mind. When writing the rule book for your board game, know your target audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is one other aspect of board game creation that might not apply to all board games but is a good thing to keep in mind. Expansions. A lot of board games come with expansion packs. The only way you can create an expansion pack is if you created your board game in a way that allows for this sort of extensibility. This is very similar to how in software you don’t want to write spaghetti code and should always keep extensibility in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creating a board game has been super fun and rewarding. It made me realize that I can put my software engineering skills to use in other areas seemingly unrelated. I believe that creating a board game, and maybe even converting it to code should be an activity done in schools in software courses.&nbsp;Especially for younger students who may not be interested in software yet.</p>



<p>This is my insight into board game creation and how it relates to software. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:ddorosz@katsudo.io">ddorosz@katsudo.io</a> if you have any questions, want to chat, or are interested in finding out more about the board game and when we plan on releasing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the second part of our look at the basic structure of food production (particularly grains to make bread) in the pre-modern world.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">Last week</a>, we began by looking at the great majority of our rural population, the little farmers.  Now I know everyone is eager to get to the mechanics of planting, harvesting, threshing, milling, baking and so on, but we have one more group of people in the countryside to talk about: the much smaller group of larger landholders, or as they are often generally referred to, the ‘big men.’</p>



<p>Now I should begin by noting that not all of our ‘big men’ are, in fact, men – though most were.  Exactly how many large rural landholders are women varies from one pre-modern society to the next (though it is almost always a minority), but it was generally not zero, save in a relative handful of societies which specifically <em>completely </em>barred women from independent landholdings by law (some Greek <em>poleis</em> did this, for instance); even in sharply patriarchal societies like Rome, there would always be a handful of great estates run by women, particularly widows.  Nevertheless ‘big man’ (or ‘big person’) is a fairly common way to refer to these fellows across languages (for instance, magnates from Latin <em>magnati</em>, literally ‘big men,’ mirrored by the Greek μεγιστᾶνες (‘big men’) which has the same meaning; ‘grandees’ has the same sense, coming from Portuguese).  I don’t want to use many of the language-specific terms because they often come with additional meaning – we could call these fellows ‘nobles’ or ‘aristocrats’ or ‘the gentry’ in various times and places, but these terms often imply rigid social classes which don’t apply cross-culturally (and in many cases might have no real equivalent in societies which still have recognizable rural ‘big men’).  Almost all of these traditional terms for the ‘big men’ (who again, are not all men) are loaded with some sort of meaning which won’t do for our very general look at the basic structures of pre-modern cereal agriculture.</p>



<p><strong>So instead, I am going to go with the somewhat clinical and bland “large landholders”</strong> most of whom are men (but some of whom are women), but <strong>all of whom hold lots of land</strong>.  But what I want to stress is that these fellows were understood as being ‘big’ in the sense that they held a lot of agricultural <em>capital</em> but <em>also</em> generally ‘big’ in the sense that they dominated, socially and politically, their societies (notice though how the words used to describe them above often <em>also</em> imply ‘bigness’ of ability or character – like ‘noble’ – they certainly <em>believed this about themselves</em> and they write most of our sources; one assumes the  peasantry viewed the matter quite differently, though they only infrequently get a chance to say it to us).  Now I know that capital is a scary word in some quarters, worry not.  We are going to use it in a fairly simple, direct way just to mean all of the things – land, animals, equipment, infrastructure – which make farming productive.  While these large landholders <em>almost always</em> represent a legally or socially privileged class,<strong> what matters for us is how their large landholdings and capital reshaped farming in the countryside</strong>.  I am not going to get too deep into the landholders themselves beyond these effects – they already get <em>quite enough</em> attention in their role as military, political and cultural elites as it is (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/">even </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/12/collections-a-trip-through-cicero-natural-law/">elsewhere </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/05/collections-a-trip-through-thucydides-fear-honor-and-interest/">on </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">this </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/03/27/a-trip-through-dhuoda-of-uzes-carolingian-values/">blog</a>).</p>



<p><strong>So how do these large landholders function in a countryside mostly composed of small subsistence farmers?</strong>  Let’s walk out of the village and up to the manor and find out.</p>

<h2>Farming Capital</h2>



<p>What generally defines our large landholders is their greater access to <em>capital</em>.  Now we don’t want to think of capital in the sort of money-denominated, fungible sense of modern finance, but in a very concrete sense: land, infrastructure, animals, and equipment.  As we’ll see, it isn’t just that the big men hold more of this capital, but that they hold fundamentally different <em>sorts</em> of capital and often use it very differently.</p>



<p>Of course this begins with <strong>land</strong>.  The thing to keep in mind is that prior to the modern period (really, later still – we might equally say prior to the industrial revolution; c. 1760 instead of c. 1500) the vast majority of economic activity was the production of the land.  That meant that land was both the primary form of holding wealth but also the main income-producing asset.  <strong>Consequently, larger land holdings are the assets that <em>enable</em> the accumulation of all of the other kinds of capital we’re discussing</strong>.  By having more land – typically <em>much</em> more land – than is required to feed a single household, these larger farmers can (as we’ll discuss in a bit) produce for markets and trade, enabling them to afford to acquire labor, animals, equipment and so on.  Our subsistence farmers of the last post, focused on producing for survival, would be hard-pressed to acquire much further in the way of substantial capital.</p>



<p>The next most important category is generally <strong>animals</strong>, particularly a <strong>plow team</strong> (typically two oxen, but sometimes draft horses and sometimes four instead of two).  I realize I didn’t spell this out explicitly in the previous piece, <strong>but while our small subsistence farmers may keep chickens or pigs on some small part of the pasture they have access to, they probably <em>do not</em> have a complete plow-team for their own farm</strong> (but I should note there is a <em>lot</em> of variability in this; my impression is that moving forward chronologically, you tend to see more plow-teams in the middle ages compared to the ancient world, and more in the early modern compared to the middle ages, occasionally held in common by villages).  Oxen and horses are <em>hideously</em> expensive, both to acquire but also to feed and for a family barely surviving one year to the next, they simply cannot afford them.  They also do not have herds of animals (because their small farms absolutely cannot support acres of pasturage) and they probably have limited access to <em>herdsmen</em> generally (that is, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">transhumant pastoralists</a> moving around the countryside) because those fellows will tend to want to interact with the community <em>leaders</em> who are, as noted above, the large landholders.  All of which is to say that while the small farmers may keep a few animals, they do not have access to significantly large numbers of animals (or humans), which matters, as we’ll see.</p>

Apologies for poor quality of the image, getting a decent picture that is of the painting itself and not a reproduction is difficult; this one is from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Tomb_of_Sennedjem#/media/File:Deir_el-Medina-20-Grab_1-Sennedjem-Pflueger-Saeerin-1982-gje.jpg">wikipedia</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first impact of having a plow-team is fairly obvious: <strong>a plow drawn by a couple of oxen is more effective than a plow pushed by a single human</strong>.  That means that a plow-team lets the same amount of farming <em>labor</em> sow a larger area of land (and if your thought is, “ok, but what about the <em>harvest</em>” – good, keep a pin in that, we’ll come back to it). <strong> It also allows for a larger, deeper plow, which in turn plows at a greater depth, which<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19093521/"> can improve yields </a></strong>(we’ll get into why and how plowing works next week).  You can easily see why, for a landholder with a large farm, having a plow-team is so useful: whereas the subsistence farmer struggles by having too much labor (and too many mouths to feed) and too little land, the big landholder has a lot of land they are trying to get farmed with as little labor as possible.  And of course, more to the point, the large landholder has the wealth and acreage necessary to buy and then pasture the animals in the plow-team.</p>



<p>The second major impact is <strong>manure</strong>.  Remember that our farmers live before the time of artificial fertilizer.  Crops, especially bulk cereal crops, wear out the nutrients in the soil quite rapidly after repeated harvests, which leaves the farmer two options.  The first, standard option, is that the farmer can fallow the field (which also has the advantage of disrupting certain pest life-cycles); depending on the farming method, fallowing may mean planting specific plants to renew the soil’s nutrients when those plants are uprooted and left to return to the soil in the field or it may mean simply turning the field over to wild plants with a similar effect.  The second option is using fertilizer, which in this case means manure.  Quite a lot of it.  Aggressive manuring, particularly on rich soils which have good access to moisture (because cropping also dries out the soil; fallowing can restore that moisture) allows the field to be fallowed less frequently and thus farmed more intensively.  In some cases it allowed rich farmland to be <em>continuously</em> cropped, with fairly dramatic increases in returns-to-acreage as a result.  And by increasing the nutrients in the soil, it also produces higher yields in a given season.</p>



<p>Now the humans in a farming household aren’t going to generate enough manure on their own to make a meaningful contribution to soil fertility.  But the larger landholders generally have two advantages in this sense.  <strong>First, because their landholdings are large, they can afford to turn over marginal farming ground to pasture for horses, cattle, sheep and so on</strong>; these …</p></div></div>

Concerning 10up's action, its purpose is to upload the plugin release from GitHub to WordPress' SVN. This can be very useful, saving us plenty of time by avoiding to do this bureaucratic conversion manually.

However, when tagging the source code (say, with <code>v0.1.5</code>), the release is already created! Hence, this tool would create yet-another release, which is far from ideal. And even worse, it requires parameter <code>tag_name</code>, but this tag can't be the same used for tagging the source code, or it gives a <code>duplicated</code> error. Then, my source code was being tagged twice: first manually as <code>v0.1.5</code>, and then automatically as <code>plugin-v0.1.5</code>.

<p>Don’t be fooled by the 13-inch MacBook <em>Pro</em>. It is <strong>not worth</strong> paying an extra $200 for the word <em>Pro</em>. Instead you should get the quad-core i5 MacBook Air with 16GB of memory for $1299.<br></p>



<figure><a href="https://getonthestore.com/?attachment_id=176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-9.57.29-AM.png" alt="" width="505" height="409" srcset="https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-9.57.29-AM.png 1010w, https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-9.57.29-AM-300x243.png 300w, https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-9.57.29-AM-768x622.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px"></a><figcaption>Click to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can get a Mac mini with similar specs for $1000, but most people prefer the portability of a laptop so that’s what I cover here. If your budget is under $1000 you should buy a used Mac. Get one with a quad-core i5 processor, at least 8GB of memory and a solid state drive. </p>



<h2><br>How I picked</h2>



<p><br>The most important metrics for a personal development machine are the number of years you can upgrade to the latest Xcode and the build time for incremental builds. If your employer is paying, you can convince them that any extra performance is worth it, but when you’re paying you realize it’s not. Spending twice the money will probably make the difference between getting 8 years or 9 years out of a computer.</p>



<p>Other important factors to consider are the project size and number of storyboard scenes the computer can handle and the time it takes to launch a simulator. A computer with short build times will do well at all of these.</p>



<p>The MacBook Air has the newest generation of keyboard which is a big improvement over the keyboards of the last four years. If you are buying a used MacBook make sure you try out the keyboard to see if you like it before you buy.</p>



<p>Selecting the 8GB model would be fine for now, but upgrading memory is not an option in any of the MacBooks that work with Xcode 12. At some time in the next 8 years you will need 16GB of memory, so get it now.</p>



<h2><br>The Research</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan-dimmock-3mt71MKGjQ0-unsplash-300x169.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan-dimmock-3mt71MKGjQ0-unsplash-300x169.jpg 300w, https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan-dimmock-3mt71MKGjQ0-unsplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan-dimmock-3mt71MKGjQ0-unsplash-768x432.jpg 768w, https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan-dimmock-3mt71MKGjQ0-unsplash-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan-dimmock-3mt71MKGjQ0-unsplash-373x210.jpg 373w, https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan-dimmock-3mt71MKGjQ0-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure></div>



<p><br>I work full time as an iOS developer and have used nine consecutive versions of Xcode. I run Xcode on my personal late 2012 MacBook Pro Retina which has a dual-core i5 processor with 8GB of memory. I also run Xcode on my work MacBook Pro which has an 8-core i9 processor with 32GB of memory. After 8 years my personal Mac still works great, but it does feel a bit under-powered compared to the work computer. The price and performance of my personal Mac was right in the middle of Apple’s product line when I bought it. The MacBook Air I recommend today falls in the same place.</p>



<p>I’m only considering an upgrade now because I won’t be able to update to macOS Big Sur. My computer doesn’t get the update because Intel stopped supporting firmware updates for 2012 processors. Today’s MacBook Air has the 10th generation i5 processor, while MacBook Pro is still on the 8th Generation. The 8th generation of processors is a year older, so it’s likely to be dropped a year before the 10th generation. Another strike against MacBook Pro.</p>



<h3>Should you get more memory or a better processor?</h3>



<p>I analyzed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/xcode-hardware-performance" target="_blank">community sourced</a> incremental build times to answer that question. This data was gathered by building the same project on many different computers. My analysis showed that incremental build time does not improve on computers with more than 4 cores or on computers with more than 16GB of memory.</p>



<p>The standard 256GB drive should also be enough. The latest version of macOS plus Xcode and the iOS Simulator only take up 36GB.</p>



<h3><br>Should you wait for Apple Silicon?</h3>



<p>Apple Silicon are Apple’s new processors. We don’t know what they will cost, but you don’t need to wait on them because the better the new chips are the more they will cost. The MacBook Air with an Intel chip is already going to give you 8 years of great performance. I don’t expect Apple to start selling an affordable Apple Silicon Mac before late 2022. </p>



<p>A new processor type doesn’t destroy the value of the old type. I resold my PowerPC based iMac four years after Apple started the PowerPC to Intel transition. I sold it for 60% of the new price and had no trouble finding a buyer. But you don’t need to take my word for it.</p>



<blockquote><p> “We plan to continue to support and release new versions of macOS for Intel-based Macs for years to come. In fact, we have some new Intel-based Macs in the pipeline that we’re really excited about.”</p><cite>Tim Cook</cite></blockquote>



<h2>When should you upgrade?</h2>



<p>Improvements in computers come very slowly so there’s few reasons to upgrade as long as you can run the latest version of macOS. Once you can’t do that you know that you only have about 18 months until that computer can no longer submit apps to the App Store. Only then is it time to look for an upgrade.</p>



<figure><img src="https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-30-at-2.37.19-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-30-at-2.37.19-PM.png 617w, https://getonthestore.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-30-at-2.37.19-PM-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px"><figcaption><a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s unlikely that we will see a better development computer come to the market any time soon. For that reason I think it’s a great time to get the $1299 MacBook Air.</p>

        <p>I interviewed OpenAI's GPT-3 on how to measure and improve website performance.</p>
<p>This article contains the interview, additional performance tips from GPT-3, and a guide to using GPT-3 on <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/">AIDungeon</a>. I added notes to the interview when I thought GPT-3 got something wrong.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I used <a href="https://twitter.com/AiDungeon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AiDungeon</a> to interview GPT-3 about measuring and improving web performance.

<h2 id="the-interview">The Interview</h2>
<p><span></span>Can you tell me a bit about why web performance is important?</p>
<p><span></span>Web performance is important because it's one of the few things that can affect our users' experience in real time. <strong>If we don't get this right, then our users will be frustrated and leave our sites.</strong></p>
<p><span></span>Do you think websites have been getting slower over the years?</p>
<p><span></span>I think most people would say websites have been getting slower over the years. Perhaps this is due to <strong>increasing expectations from users</strong>, or maybe the <strong>proliferation of larger and more media-intensive sites</strong>.</p>
<p><span></span>What are some factors that affect how fast a website loads?</p>
<p><span></span>A number of things can affect how fast a website loads. In this case, let's talk about network conditions and how the code of the website is optimized.</p>
<p><span></span>How do network conditions affect site performance?</p>
<p><span></span>Network conditions affect site performance because the internet isn't fast everywhere. If your connection is slow then the website will be slower to load, but it doesn't mean that it won't eventually fully load.</p>
<p><span></span>What are some good ways to measure website performance?</p>
<p><span></span>There are many different ways to measure website performance. One of the more common ones is called <strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights</a></strong>. It's provided by Google and gives you a quick and easy look into how optimized your website is.</p>
<p><span></span>I regenerated this response twice, because I for now I wanted to talk about tools rather than metrics.</p>
<p><span></span>When would you use <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest</a> rather than Lighthouse?</p>
<p><span></span><strong>I personally use WebPageTest when I need more detailed information about network performance</strong> or when Lighthouse gives me an inconsistent score and I want to understand why.</p>
<p><span></span>Is the Lighthouse performance score you get from PageSpeed Insights a good indicator of the website's performance?</p>
<p><span></span>It's a decent starting point. The higher the score, the better, but keep in mind that this is just one measure of performance.</p>
<p><span></span>What other metrics do you look at when investigating website performance?</p>
<p><span></span>Besides the Largest Contentful Paint, <strong>I also look at First Input Delay and First Meaningful Paint</strong>.</p>
<p><span></span>Can you explain what the Largest Contentful Paint measures?</p>
<p><span></span>The Largest Contentful Paint measures when the largest bit of content first appears on the page. This means that the user will have something to look at, typically text or an image.</p>
<p><span></span>GPT-3 seems to talk about the First Contentful Paint in the second sentence. It's description of the LCP is basically right, it's the time at which the largest block of content renders.</p>
<p><span></span>Do you think the shift to client-side apps is hurting web performance?</p>
<p><span></span>Yes, I do. But it's not because of the performance, it's because it's harder to enforce consistent UX patterns.</p>
<p><span></span>I think "it" here refers to the shift to client side apps. If some of your site needs to be a React app then it's easier to make everything a React app, rather than maintaining separate code and keeping the two in sync.</p>
<p><span></span>What can I do to speed up my client-side app?</p>
<p><span></span>There are a few different approaches you can take, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. One is to <strong>'<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate">hydrate</a>' the app once the markup and assets are done downloading</strong>.</p>
<p><span></span>What GPT-3 is talking about here is rendering static HTML on the server, so the page content instantly appears when the user opens the page. Once your client-side JavaScript code has been downloaded, the HTML is then made interactive. This process on the client is called hydration.</p>
<p><span></span>How can I reduce the size of my JavaScript bundles?</p>
<p><span></span>One of the easiest things you can do is <strong>remove any modules or packages that you aren't using</strong>. For instance, let's say you're building a React.js app and aren't using routing.</p>
<p><span></span>Basically, split your bundle so you can load just the modules you actually need on the page requested by the user. I guess GPT-3 is using routing on a different page and that's why it's in the bundle?</p>
<p><span></span>What else can I do?</p>
<p><span></span>If you're building a single page app, make sure you're asynchronously loading your scripts. This way, the page doesn't have to wait for all of the JS to be downloaded before rendering any of it.</p>
<p><span></span>How do <strong>third-party scripts</strong> affect performance?</p>
<p><span></span>The worst ones are ad providers, like Google's AdSense. They <strong>can slow down your entire site just by being included</strong>.</p>
<p><span></span>What image format should I use if I want my website to load quickly?</p>
<p><span></span>While there are a lot of image formats, the two main ones are JPEG and PNG. The quickest to load are the WebP image format, but browsers don't natively support them yet.</p>
<p><span></span>GPT-3 initially said "GIF and JPEG are more or less the same", so I gave it another chance and regenerated this response.</p>
<p><span></span>WebP is supported in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. The next version of iOS Safari will also support WebP.</p>
<p><span></span>What's the difference between JPEG and PNG?</p>
<p><span></span>PNG is a lossless format, so it produces the exact same image quality as the original, but it can be larger in size compared to JPEG.</p>
<p><span></span>What can I do about slow response times from my server?</p>
<p><span></span>The most common issue is that your server isn't configured properly to handle the load. You need to make sure that you have enough RAM, and that your CPU isn't overworked.</p>
<p><span></span>What other common causes are there?</p>
<p><span></span>The next most common issue is that your database isn't configured properly to handle the load. Slow database queries can cause your site to feel really slow, as it has to wait for the responses.</p>
<p><span></span>What's an example of an improperly configured database?</p>
<p><span></span>The most common issue is that <strong>database queries are too complex, and need to be simplified</strong>.</p>
<p><span></span>I was kinda hoping it would bring up column indexes when talking about database configuration.</p>
<p><span></span>What are some of the advantages of using <strong>HTTP/2</strong>?</p>
<p><span></span>It can significantly improve the performance of your site if configured properly. It <strong>allows for multiple requests to be made at the same time</strong>, and requires less requests to load a web page.</p>
<p><span></span>It's right that HTTP/2 can make multiple simulatenous requests on the same connection, but I don't see how it would require fewer requests. A big advantage of HTTP/2 is that making a large number of requests is much less of a problem than before.</p>
<p><span></span>What browser is the fastest?</p>
<p><span></span>Fastest isn't necessarily the same as most responsive, but as far as raw speed, Google Chrome generally has the fastest JavaScript engine.</p>
<p><span></span>What is a performance optimization that people don't use often enough?</p>
<p><span></span>You can <strong>use web workers to offload intensive processing</strong> from the main UI thread. It's important to use these only for intensive processing, as it can lead to poor responsiveness if misused.</p>
<p><span></span>Doing low-intensity processing in a web worker wouldn't give you any benefit, but I don't think the overhead is large enough to make your site unresponsive.</p>
<h2 id="performance-optimizations-that-arent-used-often-enough">Performance optimizations that aren't used often enough</h2>
<p>I kept regenerating the answer to the last question. Here are a few more performance tips from GPT-3</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/gpt-3-on-web-performance/perf-tips.png" alt="GPT performance tips"></p>
<h3 id="general-performance-tips">General performance tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The best optimization you can do is to minimize the amount of code you need to write.</strong> The less code you have, the less potential problems it can have, and the faster it will be.</li>
<li>The best way to see if your website is fast enough is to just load it and see how it feels. If it doesn't feel fast enough, you can make adjustments until it does.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="serving-assets">Serving assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Probably the single best thing you can do to improve page load times is implement a CDN. While it requires setting up, it has a huge effect on your site's performance.</li>
<li>People don't take advantage of transfer encoding. Transfer encoding is used to compress the data that's being sent, which allows for more information to be transferred in a given amount of time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="image-optimization">Image optimization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using data URIs instead of embedding images is a very easy way to increase performance, but not many people know about it.</li>
<li>Using vector images (like SVG) instead of bitmap images (like PNG) as they're typically smaller in size and faster to render.</li>
<li>Using spritesheets to load icons is a great way to decrease the number of HTTP requests that your page needs, as well as reducing the amount of time that it takes for the user to download everything.</li>
</ul>
<p>My understanding is that with HTTP/2 reducing the number of requests isn't as important any more, so I'd personally avoid spritesheets.</p>
<h3 id="css-amp-java-script">CSS &amp; JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minification is the process of compressing your code so it requires less bytes to send to the browser. This reduces the amount of data that has to be transferred over the network and speeds up load time.</li>
<li>Using CSS animations rather than JavaScript animations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-gpt-3-on-ai-dungeon">Using GPT-3 on AIDungeon</h2>
<p>I used AIDungeon to generate the interview, as the OpenAI API is currently invite-only.</p>
<p>To use GPT-3 you need a Pro account, which costs $10/mo. Otherwise AIDungeon will use GPT-2. After upgrading you need to change to the Dragon model in the settings.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/gpt-3-on-web-performance/ai-model-type.png" alt="AIDungeon model type"></p>
<p>Next, start a single-player game and choose the "custom" option.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/gpt-3-on-web-performance/aidungeon-settings.png" alt="AIDungeon settings"></p>
<p>You now need to provide a <strong>prompt</strong>. This is the prompt I used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're a web developer trying to improve the performance of your website. You talk to a colleague about front-end performance metrics, how to speed up your site, and how to measure and improve performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You say "Can you explain what the First Contentful Paint measures?"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"The First Contentful Paint measures when content first starts rendering on a web page. This means the user has something to look at, usually text or an image."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You say "Can you tell me a bit about why web performance is important?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If things go well you'll get a good answer right away. In this example GPT-3 doesn't quite understand the interview format yet, so you get …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/freakwave.jpg" alt="Freak wave"></p>

<p>During the pandemic, I’ve done my civic duty and spent lockdown reading a ton of random stuff on the internet. In the midst of a Wikipedia binge, I went down a rabbit hole on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave">rogue waves</a>: massive waves that occur in the middle of the ocean, endangering ships and generating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu4ogCy5d4k">kickass Youtube content</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of a rogue wave reminded me of a particularly challenging stage in the life of many venture-backed enterprise SaaS startups. Similar to how a rogue wave forms, during this phase many Small Problems coincide and create a Big Problem. Also like rogue waves, this moment in the life of a high-growth enterprise SaaS business is uncommon – it seems to occur around $5-20 million ARR, which relatively few companies reach, and can seem almost mythical. And finally, the effects of both rogue waves and this challenging startup stage are predictable: if you spend long enough on the high seas, they’re waiting for you.</p>

<p>I’ve seen this phenomenon both in-person as an operator and as an observer of other companies, and I do believe it’s real. I’m writing this essay in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share what I’ve seen</li>
  <li>Provide some opinions on what you can do about it</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully I can be the crusty old mariner bringing back tales that others find useful.</p>

<h2 id="hitting-the-wall">Hitting the Wall</h2>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/boat.jpg" alt="Big boat, bigger wave">
Startups can be stressful</p>

<p>The rogue wave typically seems to hit between $5M and $20M in ARR. If you’re operating with a common venture-backed SaaS model of <a href="https://www.saastr.com/how-to-figure-out-your-competitors-revenues-in-about-70-seconds/">$1-200k ARR per employee</a>, this is around where you’ll hit the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191001-dunbars-number-why-we-can-only-maintain-150-relationships">Dunbar number</a> of ~150 people: the point where you can no longer operate as a large family, and need to start acting like a corporation. <em>(Note that the post linked is from 2012 – SaaS has since exploded, and more companies are raising huge rounds and hiring more on less revenue)</em></p>

<p>Crossing the 150-person barrier is both operationally and emotionally difficult:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operational: We have so many teams, we need regular status reports!</li>
  <li>Emotional: Why do I need to send <em>you</em> a status report all of a sudden, I thought we were all friends here?!</li>
</ul>

<p>This transition point is also when many leaders who excelled in scrappy startup mode <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/06/27/hardest-part-of-startup-scale-yourself.html">struggle to level up</a> in a larger organization. Some successfully scale themselves (slow, painful) and others will leave the company (fast, but often even more painful).</p>

<p>Many of the first contracts that you closed post-traction come up for renewal around this point (in the enterprise – SMB SaaS has less predictable growth profiles). If you’re following a <a href="https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/">triple-triple-double-double-double</a> growth path, you’ll be at roughly your second triple. There will be too many customers for the founding team to personally visit and retain everyone.</p>

<p>At this point you’ll need to renew “real” customers, not just friends who took a flyer on your infant product. These aren’t the earliest adopters who will be with you through thick and thin and are really closer to partners. These are real live paying customers who will leave if your product is screwed up. As these renewals approach, a mature post-sales motion becomes essential.</p>

<p>The expectations around your revenue also become more real at this stage. Under about $10M ARR, your revenue projections can be a mild shitshow. But the expectation that you’ll have at least some semblance of predictability steadily increases.</p>

<p>And through it all you need to continue to scale the product. Your code is no longer a series of never-ending green fields rolling off into the distance, and non-trivial parts of your product will need to be meaningfully restructured. You’re burdened by decisions made years ago, often by people who are no longer on the team.</p>

<p>This is especially true for enterprise SaaS. Enterprise products are much more unwieldy than jewel-box consumer products, as they have to support many more users and workflows. Consumer products are like Chipotle: a small, carefully curated set of menu items, built for elegance and efficiency. Enterprise products are like the Cheesecake Factory: you can get steak, pasta, a milkshake and 4 kinds of margarita in the same meal. You need to level up how your team builds products.</p>

<h2 id="cresting-the-wave">Cresting the Wave</h2>

<p>I’m writing about this phenomenon because if you haven’t seen or heard about it, there isn’t really a good way to realize that it might be coming. Even if it isn’t preventable, it’s better to know what’s on the horizon. After all, being able to see around corners is why many companies hire experienced operators.</p>

<p>I won’t claim to be an expert on how to react, but I can share a few things that I think work well and a few that don’t, and what I would do if I had to go through this phase again.</p>

<h3 id="the-crew">The Crew</h3>

<p>First, I would do my best to get the right team in place in advance. In particular, I would make sure that I had very strong functional heads for the functions that will be strained the most: Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support, and Customer Success. You don’t need every role covered, but it saves headaches to know that some parts of the team are bulletproof. This isn’t the time for unforced errors.</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/pirate-crew.jpg" alt="Pirates of the Caribbean crew">
You want a senior crew. You can tell that Sharkman here has experience and won’t freak out when the database goes down or a large account churns.</p>

<p>I also recommend hiring senior team members who can help see around corners and anticipate issues. This is a taxing time period because it’s so damn busy, and raw, well-directed horsepower tends to carry the day in those situations. More importantly, seasoned operators have typically seen challenging times before, and have the composure to handle them calmly because they know that things are always on fire.</p>

<p>It’s tempting during these busy times to make very junior hires such as new college graduates or coding bootcamp grads just to put butts in seats. These folks can be excellent hires in calmer times, but the chaos caused by too many inexperienced employees is very difficult while you’re cresting the wave.</p>

<h3 id="steering-the-ship">Steering the Ship</h3>

<p>Startups are generally fairly stressful, and that’s heightened in this time period. When operational problems strike in stressful times, it’s common to blame the people involved rather than processes – in reality, bad processes or incentives are usually the root cause.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the faster you’re growing, the more lightweight your processes should be. When you’re in rapid scaling mode your operational tempo is constantly changing, so there’s no point boiling the ocean to create a perfect process when next month so much will have changed.</p>

<p>For example: when confronting a startup rogue wave, I would not choose to reinvent a completely new system for launching new features. Instead, use 20% of the time to set up a simple, predictable process that gives you 80% of the value. Example: set up a recurring check-in meeting where upcoming releases are discussed by PMs and Tech Leads + a Slack thread where all new releases are announced when they go-live. It won’t be perfect, but you can get this up and running in 15 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="commit">Commit</h3>

<p>This is not the time to hedge your decisions or waffle on strategy.</p>

<p>For example: in general, I prefer to give people a generous window of time to grow into stretch roles. Promoting from within builds continuity, leads to a more invested team, and motivates others by demonstrating that you’re creating strong career paths. But in this phase it’s especially important that you commit to keeping or replacing leaders fast, as there’s just too much going on.</p>

<p>If you’re 30% of the way up a 100 foot wall of water and decide to adjust course, you’re going to get slammed.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-calm">Keeping Calm</h3>

<p>Whatever you do, <em>don’t freak out</em>. When it feels like shit is hitting the fan everywhere, it’s easy to want to react and search for magic solutions. Hire a new Head of X! Spend less! No wait, spend <em>more</em>! Pause development and focus on tech debt! Actually our largest customer needs more features, cancel all tech debt projects!</p>

<p>In reality, to take a line from The Sopranos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_po7So0MKq4">it won’t be cinematic</a>. Life isn’t a movie. There are no magic fixes – this challenging phase gets resolved by showing up and executing in an unflashy way for months. Magic fixes never really exist, and that’s especially true since this crucible stems from several medium-sized problems amplifying one another.</p>

<p>Searching for a unified solution to your troubles risks distraction. The road is reasonably straightforward and the challenges are tractable: there are just a lot of them. Just like an actual rogue wave, you can’t flee or dodge the factors that make crossing these rogue waves so difficult. You succeed by pointing your boat right at the problem and hitting the gas. Keeping calm doesn’t mean being stubborn or refusing to change, but it does mean that you can’t second guess your decisions – especially when it feels like you’re climbing a wall of water.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Not everyone makes it over the wave – of the roughly 10 cases that I’ve observed, roughly half had their growth stunted for at least several years after hitting this stage. In my opinion this SaaS rogue wave should be taken seriously.</p>

<p>But the good news is that once you’ve crossed the wave, you can speed up again. As you’re rising up the wall everything goes into slow motion; but once you’ve crested the top, your acceleration can increase again as you’ve set yourself up with a more stable operating model and a hardened team.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful time, as there’s so much opportunity. Your team is still in place. The market opportunity is there, and people are buying. And once you’re over the top, the water is much calmer towards the horizon.</p>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many challenging situations tend to arise simultaneously when high growth enterprise SaaS companies hit roughly $5-20 million ARR.</li>
  <li>The good news is that after this phase things get easier – the bad news is that it’s not easily avoidable.</li>
  <li>The best way to move forward is to focus on executing – and don’t be overly reactive.</li>
</ul>

I'm Daniel Bryant and I'd like to welcome you to the Ambassador Livin' On the Edge podcast, the show that focuses on all things related to cloud-native platforms, creating effective developer workflows, and building modern APIs. Today, I'm joined by Katie Gamanji, Cloud Platform Engineer at American Express and TOC member of the CNCF. Katie has recently been writing and talking about the building blocks of developer experience with interacting with Kubernetes clusters, from the kubectl or kubectl that we all know and love to other GUI driven tooling and more.</p><p>Daniel Bryant (00:31):</p><p>One of her fantastic recent blog posts discussed the use of kubectl UI wrappers, like K9s and Octant, in addition to covering cloud platform web based portal approaches using ClickOps, and also YAML driven approaches such as GitOps. I was keen to hear Katie's analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and also understand her recommendations as to what to use and when.</p><p>Daniel Bryant (00:51):</p><p>Additionally, I've learned a lot from Katie recently around the evolving cluster API and I was keen to understand how this is becoming integrated with the Kubernetes developer experience. And for example, I was keen to understand, is the tooling mature enough to allow us to treat Kubernetes clusters as cattle and not pets?</p><p>If you like what you hear today, I would definitely encourage you to pop over to our website. That's www.getambassador.io where we have a range of articles, white papers, and videos that provide more information for engineers working in the Kubernetes and cloud space. You can also find links there to our latest releases, such as the Ambassador Edge Stack, our open source Ambassador API gateway, and also our CNCF-hosted Telepresence tool too. So hi Katie, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for joining us today.</p><p>Katie (01:31):</p><p>Hello, Daniel, happy to be here.</p><p>Daniel Bryant (01:33):</p><p>Could you briefly introduce yourself for the listeners please and share a recent career highlight?</p><p>Katie (01:37):</p><p>Yes. So my name is Katie Gamanji and I am one of the cloud platform engineers for American Express. I've joined American Express six months ago, so quite recently, and I am part of the team that aims to transform the current platform by embracing the cloud native principles and making the best use of the open source tools. In terms of my career highlights, quite recently I've been elected as one of the TOC for the CNCF. So this has been quite a new and quite grand event in my career development, I would say. Being part of the CNCF as a TOC is, I think quite a good opportunity to really influence and leverage how the CNCF landscape should be constructed. So we have the power to leverage different projects and to move them through the pipeline all the way to graduations, such as, for example, quite recently, Helm graduated or of course Kubernetes which has been graduated for quite a while now.</p><p>Daniel Bryant (02:34):</p><p>Brilliant. Brilliant. You've got so many highlights Katie, at QCon, keynoting, you were keynoting some other stuff online. You got so many to choose from, right?</p><p>Katie (02:41):</p><p>Absolutely. Yeah. I'm enjoying it though.</p><p>Daniel Bryant (02:44):</p><p>Good on you. Yeah. Brilliant. So first the traditional question in the podcast is around developer experiences and developer loops. So that capability of being able to rapidly have an idea, code, test, deploy, release, and verify. And I ask folks to share their worst developer experience, you don't have to name names, protect the guilty and the innocent, right? But can you share your worst developer experience?</p><p>Katie (03:06):</p><p>Oh, I think I've had quite a few bad experiences when it comes to deploying an application and troubleshooting an application. And I think that's why actually I'm in this industry, I want to improve all of these methods around deployment. So I think one of, I wouldn't say the worst, but quite generic was when we'd like to deploy an application through our pipelines, or a team would like to deploy their application through our pipelines. Unfortunately, we had verticals when it comes to, for example, networking and security and the CI and CD, there was all divided across different teams. It wasn't one unified manner. So what actually happens if something would, for example, fail at the networking level in the pipeline, imagine the stress to actually understanding why it failed. As an end user you don't really understand that, so you have to go through every single team. There were so many points of contacts to potentially troubleshoot any bug in your application. And I think that's definitely the worst.</p><p>Katie (04:05):</p><p>Why I'm saying it's the worst, sometimes it can take days and it's very overwhelming. And I think that's definitely one of the worst DX that we can provision for any kind of engineers. And that's why, as I mentioned, I'm in this industry, in this area of technology where we can really close the gap between all of these functionalities, but at the same time, bring automation around them, bring transparency around them. So the power would be with the developers. Of course they would need to be up skilled, but they would have an understanding of how to troubleshoot and connect to the application and how to properly debug it and just reach us when they need to. So, yeah, that's my motivation, why I'm in this position. But when I started in this area, it was that, pretty …</p></div></main></div></div></div></div>

July 31, 2020 | https://sorbet.org/blog/2020/07/30/ruby-3-rbs-sorbet | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sorbet.org/blog/2020/07/30/ruby-3-rbs-sorbet">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Yesterday Square <a href="https://developer.squareup.com/blog/the-state-of-ruby-3-typing/">posted an article</a> to their blog introducing
<a href="https://github.com/ruby/rbs">RBS</a> (Ruby Signature), a type syntax format for Ruby 3.</p>
<p>We’d like to take a second to speak to how RBS relates to Sorbet. The short
version: Sorbet will happily incorporate RBS as a way to specify type
annotations, in addition to the existing syntax Sorbet supports. Stripe still
has a very strong commitment to Sorbet’s continued progress and success. While
the Ruby core team has been working on syntax, we’ve been working on features
that build on top of that syntax.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I’d love to start a discussion of some of the finer points of
what this announcement means for Ruby, and for Sorbet.</p>
<!--truncate-->
<h2>RBI? RBS?</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://youtu.be/2g9R7PUCEXo?t=2076">Matz announced at RubyConf 2019</a>, Ruby 3 plans to ship type
annotations for the standard library in a particular format. We’ve been meeting
with Matz and the Ruby core team to provide input on our experience and learn
from them how they’re thinking about types so that Sorbet wil be ready. We’re
<a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/faq#when-ruby-3-gets-types-what-will-the-migration-plan-look-like">committed</a> to supporting Ruby 3’s type syntax.</p>
<p>In the mean time, we’ve kept busy. While the Ruby core team has been working on
the RBS syntax over the past year, the Sorbet team has delivered tons of other
features. A sampling of features that didn’t exist a year ago:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Definition (Aug 2019)</li>
<li><a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/exhaustiveness">Exhaustiveness checking</a> (Aug 2019)</li>
<li><a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/tenum">Typed enums</a> (Nov 2019)</li>
<li>Autocompletion (Nov 2019)</li>
<li>Step-function improvements in IDE speed (Feb 2020, June 2020)</li>
</ul>
<p>These features make Sorbet users more productive, empowering them to do more
with Sorbet. We’ll happily incorporate any other syntax the Ruby core team wants
to build.</p>
<h2>Wait, a wholly separate file?</h2>
<p>RBS type signatures are placed in a separate file. While Sorbet also offers
inline syntax (more later), we believe that supporting type signatures in a
separate file is necessary. Consider: most of the Ruby standard library is
implemented in C for performance (e.g., all <code>Array</code> and <code>Hash</code> functions, and
many others). There must be a way to ascribe types to these internally defined
classes and methods.</p>
<p>Providing types for the standard library is incredibly important! In completely
untyped, unannotated Ruby codebases, people who try out Sorbet for the first
time find that about 25% of call sites already have static type coverage. Why?
Everyday Ruby code uses the standard library abundantly, and Sorbet includes
type definitions for the standard library out of the box!</p>
<p>Additionally, there will always be libraries that prefer not using type
annotations. To integrate an untyped library into a typed Ruby codebase, there
must be a place for these types to live outside of that project. In fact, we
already have the <a href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet-typed">sorbet-typed</a> repo for this purpose.</p>
<p>Thus, both Sorbet and Ruby 3 support type annotations in separate files (via RBI
files and RBS files, respectively).</p>
<h2>What about inline type annotations?</h2>
<p>There are people using Ruby who still prefer type annotations to live in the
code itself. We’ve built Sorbet to cater to both groups: those who <strong>like and
don’t like</strong> type annotations benefit from Sorbet.</p>
<p>How? Sorbet implements a <a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/gradual">gradual type system</a>. Without any type annotations,
Sorbet will do its best to understand and offer feedback on your code. With type
annotations exclusively in separate files, Sorbet will understand more and offer
better feedback. With inline type annotations, people can tell Sorbet every
little detail about their code so Sorbet can offer incredible feedback. For
these people, reading the types is as valuable as reading the code itself.</p>
<p>Sorbet has always provided syntax for inline type annotations. Annotations
aren’t required by Sorbet—they’re there for the people who want to empower
Sorbet to help them even more. Whether you love type annotations or not, Sorbet
still provides value.</p>
<h2>Why are inline type annotations useful?</h2>
<p>As we mentioned above, for those teams and projects who really want static
typing, inline type annotations become essential. Types carry intent, and there
are frequently places where inferring the intent could be ambiguous. Consider
this snippet:</p>
<pre><code>xs = [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>]
xs &lt;&lt; <span>nil</span>


</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://sorbet.run/#%23%20typed%3A%20true%0A%0Axs%20%3D%20%5B1%2C%202%2C%203%5D%0Axs%20%3C%3C%20nil">→ View on sorbet.run</a></p>
<p>A type checker could infer one of two types here:</p>
<ol>
<li>either the programmer meant for <code>xs</code> to be an array of <code>Integer</code>'s and
<code>nil</code>'s (i.e., <code>T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)]</code> in Sorbet’s syntax), or</li>
<li>the programmer made a mistake, and didn’t intend to allow <code>nil</code>'s in <code>xs</code>
(i.e., it was intended to be a <code>T::Array[Integer]</code>, and this code should
report a static error).</li>
</ol>
<p>Any static checker must assume one of these outcomes, but there are times when
either might make sense. Explicit annotations resolve these ambiguities. In this
case, Sorbet assumes (2) by default, but other type systems do other things. For
example, Flow <a href="https://flow.org/try/#0MYewdgzgLgBAHhGBeGBtAjAGhgJmwZgF0BuAKAQDoAHAVwgAsAKMGgG1YEpig">assumes (1) by default</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how to use an inline annotation in Sorbet to explicitly declare that (1)
is intended:</p>
<pre><code>xs = T.let([<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)])
xs &lt;&lt; <span>nil</span>


</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://sorbet.run/#%23%20typed%3A%20true%0A%0Axs%20%3D%20T.let(%5B1%2C%202%2C%203%5D%2C%20T%3A%3AArray%5BT.nilable(Integer)%5D)%0Axs%20%3C%3C%20nil">→
View on sorbet.run</a></p>
<h2>Inline type annotations must be Ruby syntax</h2>
<p>For the time being, Matz and the Ruby core team want to experiment with type
annotations without changing Ruby syntax, because that would require everyone to
upgrade to a specific Ruby version to benefit. Because Sorbet values inline type
annotations, we embedded a type annotation language in Ruby with no syntax
changes needed:</p>
<pre><code>extend T::Sig

sig {params(<span>strings:</span> T::Array[String]).returns(Integer)}
<span><span>def</span> <span>count_letters</span><span>(strings)</span></span>
  strings.map(&amp;<span>:length</span>).sum
<span>end</span>
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://sorbet.run/#%23%20typed%3A%20true%0A%0Aextend%20T%3A%3ASig%0A%0Asig%20%7Bparams(strings%3A%20T%3A%3AArray%5BString%5D).returns(Integer)%7D%0Adef%20count_letters(strings)%0A%20%20strings.map(%26%3Alength).sum%0Aend">→
View on sorbet.run</a></p>
<p>Sorbet’s syntax is 100% valid Ruby, which has tons of benefits!</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax highlighting for type annotations already works in 100% of Ruby
editors.</li>
<li>There’s no transpiler step required—Ruby code with Sorbet type annotations
runs directly.</li>
<li>Every RuboCop rule ever written works with Sorbet type annotations.</li>
<li>Any Ruby IDE with Go to Definition already has Go to Definition on type
annotations.</li>
<li>Sorbet’s RBI files are just Ruby code with empty method bodies, reusing the
inline syntax.</li>
<li>It’s backwards compatible with all supported versions of Ruby.</li>
</ul>
<p>The obvious downside is that there are prettier inline type annotation syntaxes
that are not valid Ruby. The Ruby grammar is not so complicated that it couldn’t
be changed to support type annotations. But again, this syntax does so well
<strong>because</strong> it doesn’t fracture the Ruby community with incompatible syntax
changes.</p>
<h2>Sorbet is committed to improving</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s not a choice between Ruby 3 or Sorbet—you can have
both at the same time. We love that the Ruby core team is bringing types to
Ruby, and we’re happy to incorporate their work into Sorbet. We plan to give
back too: it’s likely that the initial release of RBS files for the Ruby
standard library will be created by converting Sorbet’s already extensive
standard library annotations into the RBS format.</p>
<p>At the same time, we’re hard at work improving Sorbet. Stripe has millions of
lines of Ruby code and that number is only growing. We’re nearing our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#Percentage_calculation">second
nine</a> of percentage of files at <code># typed: true</code> or above—which is to say, those
millions of lines of Ruby use a lot of types. We have hundreds of engineers
writing Ruby and using our Sorbet-powered IDE every day.</p>
<p>Sorbet type checks these millions of lines of Ruby code in seconds, helps
prevent countless production incidents, and helps new Stripe engineers spin up
fast. And it does all this today! If you want to try it out, check out the docs:</p>
<p><a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/adopting">→ Adopting Sorbet in an Existing Codebase</a></p>
<p>or play around with small Sorbet examples online:</p>
<p><a href="https://sorbet.run/">→ Sorbet playground</a></p>
<p>Sorbet already has extensive type annotations for the Ruby standard library,
thanks in large part to the nearly 200 contributors to Sorbet that you can find
<a href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/graphs/contributors">on GitHub</a>, the vast majority of whom come to Sorbet from outside
of Stripe and the Sorbet team.</p>
<p>We’re happy that the Ruby core team is focused on continually improving Ruby,
because we are too. ❤️</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> is one of the most developer-friendly payment processors available today, having extensive and well-documented <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">APIs</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/development">SDKs</a> enabling you to finely customize your customer payment flow. If you have a simple use-case or would prefer to offload the majority of the checkout process, Stripe also provides <a href="https://stripe.com/payments/checkout">Stripe Checkout</a> where Stripe themselves will directly handle collecting the payment information and charging the customer.</p>
<p>There are several benefits to using Stripe Checkout instead of custom developing checkout pages, among them:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Reduces internal development and maintenance</b></li>
<li><b>Multiple language support</b></li>
<li><b>Regulation Compliance including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI DSS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_customer_authentication">Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)</a></b></li>
<li><b>Better fraud detection</b></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the biggest downsides of using Stripe Checkout is that customers need to be redirected to Stripe's website in order to complete the transaction, which has the potential to be a sub-optimal user experience. These are trade-offs that you'll need weigh when choosing an approach, however it should be noted that you're not locked in forever. It's perfectly reasonable to start processing customer orders with Stripe Checkout, and then at a later date switch to using a custom, streamlined checkout flow.</p>
<h2>Stripe Checkout Overview</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether you choose client-only or client/server approaches (we'll cover these in a moment), the the general Stripe Checkout flow is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://bhoey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/StripeCheckout-Overview2.jpg" alt="Stripe Checkout Overview" width="449" height="471" srcset="https://bhoey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/StripeCheckout-Overview2.jpg 449w, https://bhoey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/StripeCheckout-Overview2-286x300.jpg 286w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px"></p>
<p><b>1.</b> Starting from your product page, you'll call stripe.redirectToCheckout() JavaScript function with the appropriate parameters. This will redirect the user from your website to Stripe's to complete the payment process.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Stripe will call any webhooks registered for related events. This is an important part since Stripe recommends not depending only on the arrival at the success URL as confirmation (for example the customer could land on the success URL somehow without going through the Stripe payment process). Instead you should monitor the webhook events to confirm the payment was completed successfully.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Stripe will then redirect the user back to your site when they have either completed or canceled the checkout process. The URLs to redirect them to would have either been specified in the redirectToCheckout() call or specified on a checkout session beforehand (explained later).</p>
<h2>Client-Only Vs Client/Server</h2>
<p>There are two ways to invoke Stripe Checkout from your website: <b>client-only</b> and <b>client/server</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>Client-Only</b> approach is where all parameters are set in the frontend via Javascript and will be passed to Stripe Checkout on redirect. This method is the quickest to implement however is limited in what details you can pass to Stripe and the use-cases you can support versus the Client/Server approach. For example you aren't able to specify the Stripe customer id or handle the single-customer multiple subscriptions use-case using this approach. Stripe has <a href="https://github.com/stripe-samples/checkout-single-subscription/tree/master/client-only/client">example code on GitHub</a> demonstrating the client-only approach.</p>
<p><b>Client/Server</b> on the other hand is a staged approach where you first prepare a Checkout Session for the user on the backend and then reference it by id in the Stripe Javascript call on the frontend. This allows for much more control and is what the remainder of this post will cover.</p>
<h2>Client/Server: Preparing the Checkout Session On The Backend</h2>
<p>The first step in the client/server approach is to set up the mechanisms that will create a Checkout Session on the backend. This will be called by the frontend product page right before redirecting the user to Stripe.</p>
<p>First we define a <b>create_checkout_session</b> view that will handle requests from the frontend. Several of the details will be dependent on your particular environment, but the broad strokes are as follows:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;
# views.py

import stripe
from django.http import HttpRequest, JsonResponse
...
@login_required
def create_checkout_session(request: HttpRequest):

    customer = ... # get customer model based off request.user

    if request.method == 'POST':

        # Assign product price_id, to support multiple products you 
        # can include a product indicator in the incoming POST data
        price_id = ... # 

        # Set Stripe API key
        stripe.api_key = settings.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

        # Create Stripe Checkout session
        checkout_session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
            payment_method_types=["card"],
            mode="subscription",
            line_items=[
                {
                    "price": price_id,
                    "quantity": 1
                }
            ],
            customer=customer.id,
            success_url=f"https://YOURDOMAIN.com/payment/success?sessid={{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}}",
            cancel_url=f"https://YOURDOMAIN.com/payment/cancel", # The cancel_url is typically set to the original product page
        )

    return JsonResponse({'sessionId': checkout_session['id']})
&nbsp;
</pre>
<p>One thing to note is that {CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID} template text will be replaced by Stripe when it calls back to the success_url. (The text in this case has double curly braces on each side since I am using python f-strings and to escape a curly brace you double it).</p>
<p>Then we associate a URL path to this view in our urls.py file:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;
# urls.py
...
path('stripe/create-checkout-session', views.create_checkout_session, name="stripe_create_checkout_session"),
&nbsp;
</pre>
<h2>Client/Server: Frontend Product Page</h2>
<p>On the frontend, we'll add a Buy button and register an event listener for when its clicked. On a click event, we'll send a request to the backend to create the Checkout Session and wait for the response to get the new session's id. Finally we'll call redirectToCheckout with that session id, thereby allowing Stripe to connect the redirect request with the session previously created.</p>
<p>*Note the below code assumes the product page was rendered and supplied with context variables such as STRIPE_PUB_KEY and crsf_token.</p>
<pre>&nbsp;

    &lt;script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

...

    &lt;button type="button" id="buy-btn"&gt;Buy&lt;/button&gt;

...

    &lt;script&gt;
      var DOMAIN = window.location.origin;

      var stripe = Stripe("{{ STRIPE_PUB_KEY }}");

      // Handle any errors from Checkout
      var handleResult = function (result) {
        if (result.error) {
          var displayError = document.getElementById("error-message");
          displayError.textContent = result.error.message;
        }
      };

      // Create a Checkout Session with the selected plan ID
      var createCheckoutSession = function() {
        return fetch("/stripe/create-checkout-session", {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "X-CSRFToken":  '{{csrf_token}}',
          },
          // ... body section if you want to pass the product or price_id to the backend
        }).then(function(result) {
          return result.json();
        });
      };

    // Setup event handler to create a Checkout Session when button is clicked
      document
        .getElementById("buy-btn")
        .addEventListener("click", function (evt) {
          createCheckoutSession().then(function(data) {
            // Call Stripe.js method to redirect to the new Checkout page
            stripe
              .redirectToCheckout(
                {
                    sessionId: data.sessionId
                }
              )
              .then(handleResult);
          });
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Client/Server: Finalizing The Checkout</h2>
<p>The final step would be to listen for the <b>'checkout.session.completed'</b> webhook event and update the user status on your backend. The webhook payload looks similar to the following:</p>
<pre>{
  "id": "evt_123abc",
  "object": "event",
  "api_version": "2020-03-02",
  "created": 1596139528,
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "cs_test_1234",
      "object": "checkout.session",
      "amount_subtotal": 1499,
      "amount_total": 1499,
      "cancel_url": "https://YOURDOMAIN.com/payment/cancel",
      "currency": "usd",
      "customer": "cus_1234",
      "livemode": false,
      "metadata": {
      },
      "mode": "subscription",
      "payment_method_types": [
        "card"
      ],
      "subscription": "sub_1234",
      "success_url": "https://YOURDOMAIN.com/payment/success?sessid={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}",
    }
  },
  "request": {
    "id": "req_1234",
    "idempotency_key": null
  },
  "type": "checkout.session.completed"
}
</pre>
<p>Then when the user gets redirected to your success URL, you can verify the (now replaced) <b>sessid={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}</b> URL parameter value against what was received via the webhook to confirm payment was successful.</p>
<h2>Extra: What About djstripe?</h2>
<p><a href="https://dj-stripe.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">djstripe</a> is a Django app with additional functionality and models that aims to ease the integration between Django and Stripe.</p>
<p>There's nothing above that interferes with incorporating djstripe, in fact it would be a good fit for getting the customer object in the <b>create_checkout_session</b> view and relaying webhook events as Django signals. The instructions above were mainly intended to focus on common parts that can be implemented with or without djstripe.</p>

Whether it becomes visible sooner rather than later depends on the consistency guarantees offered by the database.</p><p>“But wait, aren’t databases supposed to take care of consistency issues for me?” I hear you ask. Some databases come with counter-intuitive consistency guarantees to provide high availability and performance. Others have knobs that allow you to chose whether you want better performance or stronger consistency guarantees, like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels">Azure’s Cosmos DB</a>. Because of that, you need to know what the trade-offs are, and whether there are knobs you can use to tune your database to your specific use-case.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what happens when you send a request to a database. In an ideal world, your request executes instantaneously:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>The best guarantee a database can provide is that the request executes somewhere between its invocation and completion time. You might think that this doesn’t look like a big deal - after all, it’s what you are used to when writing single-threaded applications - if you assign 1 to x and read its value right after, you expect to find 1 in there, assuming there is no other thread writing to the same variable. But, once you start dealing with data stores that replicate their state on multiple machines for high availability and scalability, all bets are off. To understand why that’s the case, we will explore the trade-offs a system designer has to make to implement reads in a simplified model of a distributed database.</p><p>Suppose we have a distributed key-value store, which is composed of a set of replicas. The replicas elect a leader among themselves, which is the only node that can accept writes. When the leader receives a write request, it broadcasts it asynchronously to the other replicas. Although all replicas receive the same updates in the same order, they do so at different times. </p><p>You are tasked to come up with a strategy to handle read requests - how would you go about it? Well, a read can potentially be served by the leader or a replica. If all reads were to go through the leader, the throughput would be limited by what a single node can handle. Alternatively, any replica could serve any read request - that would definitely scale, but then two clients, or observers, could have a different view of the system’s state, as replicas can lag behind the leader and between them.</p><p>Intuitively, there is a trade-off between how consistent the observers’ views of the system are, and the system’s performance and availability. To understand this relationship, we need to define precisely what we mean by consistency. We will do so with the help of <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">consistency models</a>, which formally define the possible views of the system’s state observers can experience. </p><h2 id="strong-consistency"><a href="#strong-consistency" aria-label="strong consistency permalink"></a>Strong Consistency</h2><p>If clients send writes and reads exclusively to the leader, then every request appears to take place atomically at a very specific point in time as if there was a single copy of the data. No matter how many replicas there are or how far behind they are lagging, as long as the clients always query the leader directly, from their point of view there is a single copy of data.</p><p>Because a request is not served instantaneously, and there is a single node serving it, the request executes somewhere between its invocation and completion time. Another way to think about it is that once a request completes, it’s side-effects are visible to all observers:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Since a request becomes visible to all other participants between its invocation and completion time, there is a real-time guarantee that must be enforced - this guarantee is formalized by a consistency model called <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/linearizable">linearizability</a>, or strong consistency. Linearizability is the strongest consistency guarantee a system can provide for single-object requests. </p><p>What if the client sends a read request to the leader, but by the time the request gets there, the server that received the request thinks it’s still the leader, but it actually was deposed? If the ex-leader was to process the request, the system would no longer be strongly consistent. To guard against this case, the presumed leader first needs to contact a majority of the replicas to confirm whether it still is the leader. Only then is it allowed to execute the request and send back the response to the client. This considerably increases the time required to serve a read.</p><h3 id="sequential-consistency"><a href="#sequential-consistency" aria-label="sequential consistency permalink"></a>Sequential Consistency</h3><p>So far, we have discussed serializing all reads through the leader. But doing so creates a single chokepoint, which limits the system’s throughput. On top of that, the leader needs to contact a majority of replicas to handle a read. To increase the read performance, we could allow the replicas to handle requests as well.</p><p>Even though a replica can lag behind the leader, it will always receive new updates in the same order as the leader. If a client A only ever queries replica 1, and client B only ever queries replica 2, the two clients will see the state evolving at different times, as replicas are not entirely in sync:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>The consistency model in which operations occur in the same order for all observers, but doesn’t provide any real-time guarantee about when an operation’s side-effect becomes visible to the observers, is called <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/sequential">sequential consistency</a>. The lack of real-time guarantees is what differentiates sequential consistency with linearizability. </p><p>A simple application of this model is a producer/consumer system synchronized with a queue - a producer node writes items to the queue, which a consumer reads. The producer and the consumer see the items in the same order, but the consumer lags behind the producer.</p><h3 id="eventual-consistency"><a href="#eventual-consistency" aria-label="eventual consistency permalink"></a>Eventual Consistency</h3><p>Although we managed to increase the read throughput, we had to pin clients to replicas - what if a replica goes down? We could increase the availability of the store by allowing a client to query any replica. But, this comes at a steep price in terms of consistency. Say there are two replicas 1 and 2, where replica 2 lags behind replica 1. If a client queries replica 1 and right after replica 2, it will see a state from the past, which can be very confusing. The only guarantee a client has is that eventually, all replicas will converge to the final state if the writes to the system stop. This consistency model is called eventual consistency. </p><p>It’s challenging to build applications on top of an eventually consistent data store because the behavior is different from the one you are used to when writing single-threaded applications. Subtle bugs can creep up that are hard to debug and to reproduce. Yet, in eventual consistency’s defense, not all applications require linearizability. You need to make the conscious choice whether the guarantees offered by your data store, or lack thereof, satisfy your application’s requirements. An eventually consistent store is perfectly fine if you want to keep track of the number of users visiting your website, as it doesn’t really matter if a read returns a number that is slightly out of date. But for a payment processor, you definitely want strong consistency.</p><p>There are more <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">consistency models</a> than the ones presented in this post. Still, the main intuition behind them is the same: the stronger the consistency guarantees are, the higher the latency of individual operations is, and the less available the store becomes when failures happen. This relationship is formalized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACELC_theorem">PACELC theorem</a>. It states that in case of network partitioning (P) in a distributed computer system, one has to choose between availability (A) and consistency (C), but else (E), even when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C). </p><p>In my <a href="https://systemdesignmanual.com/">system design book</a>, I explore other tunable trade-offs data stores make to guarantee high availability and performance, like the isolation guarantees that prevent a group of operations within a transaction from interfering with other concurrently running transactions. </p><hr></article></div>]]>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>Take the time to write good commit messages. Such messages communicate intent across time, and live very close to the code. Here’s an example of a bad commit message:</p>



<pre><code>Updated the code.</code></pre>



<p>There’s no intent here. Yes, of course, you did update the code. Why? Inquiring minds want to know.</p>



<pre><code>updated the acceptForm method to accept a URL escaped code</code></pre>



<p>This is slightly better, but is still no good. This is a bad commit message because it focuses on the how but not the why. Why did the <code>acceptForm </code>method need to be modified?</p>



<p>In general, great commit messages focus on the intent of the change, not the mechanics. Why was this change needed? What drove it? What would you want to know about this reasoning or decision a year from now? What would you want a new team member approaching this code base to know? These are good questions to guide you as you consider your commit message.</p>



<p>Document the reason for the change because those reasons can get lost. They may be captured in a doc, yes, but <code>git log</code> is far more accessible than a doc. In some teams and situations, you won’t even have a document to capture the purpose of the change; it might have been just a hallway discussion, a ticket filed by a customer, or a change made by a single developer without consultation. Code reviews and pull requests can help capture intent as well, but again, they may or may not be easy to find; they certainly won’t be as easy as <code>git blame</code>.</p>



<p>Here’s a good commit message:</p>



<pre><code>Updated the acceptForm method to except a URL escaped code.

Client ABC was sending a URL escaped code instead of what we expected. This means that the system was throwing a null pointer exception. Investigated changing client ABC, but that would involve releasing another version of the client library, which we are deprecating.

More details in this thread: http://slack.com/aaa/bbb

[#123]</code></pre>



<p>Feel free to write as much as you need to communicate intent. It’s also good to have a summation in the first line, then two newlines and then as much explanatory text as you want. I like to do this on the command line so that it’s easy to edit.</p>



<p>If the mechanics are particularly tricky or misleading, that’s one time you may want to focus on the how. For example, if a piece of code is purposefully using a particular deprecated data structure for compatability reasons, outline that in the commit message. </p>



<p>An additional benefit is that this forces you to think about what you were trying to accomplish with this change. If you make more than one change at a time, you can use <code><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add">git add -p</a></code> to commit only a section of a file.</p>



<p>If you make a mistake and you are using git and haven’t pushed to a remote, you can use the <code>--amend</code> command to make a change to the most recent commit message. You can also use the <code>git rebase</code> command to rework your entire commit structure, including getting rid of “there was a typo” commit messages. Here’s a video about a rebase workflow:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="1100" height="619" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWwazJ_46s0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p><figcaption>Presentation on git rebase</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, I’m definitely not perfect about this. I sometimes make errors in my messages. In that case, just as when I make any other mistake, I find out what I did wrong and try to do better next time. You can also use tooling to avoid errors. I have heard of people use tools like <a href="https://gitcop.com/">Gitcop</a> to enforce rules, but haven’t used it myself.</p>



<p>You can also add a git hook, as a team require all feature branches to reference an issue number, and parse the branch to put the issue number on every commit. Or you can modify that git hook to append the branch name, as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5894946/how-to-add-gits-branch-name-to-the-commit-message">outlined here</a>. I’ve done this on different teams and it’s low effort and effective. This isn’t perfect because you can still have a commit with a one word message, but at the least you have some link between a code change and the impetus for it.</p>



<p>Whatever you do, find out what the team norms are around this. Have your commits meet at least that level of detail. This norm may be delivered when you start, or via code reviews, but you can ask as well: “what are some great commit messages that I should model mine after?”</p>



<p>Remember, the purpose of a commit message is to communicate intent. Strive to do that and you’ll thank yourself later when you’re trying to figure out what is going on.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

<p>Check out this excerpt from the upcoming Book Club episode with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sa%C5%A1a-juri%C4%87-21b23186/">Saša Jurić</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikschon/">Erik Schön</a>&nbsp;where they explore whether Elixir could be the right tool for your job. In the interview, Erik Schön, managing director at Nordic, also explores key benefits and practices with <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>, a functional language with over 20k commits on Git Hub. The upcoming interview is based on Saša's book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3iaGv5l">Elixir in Action</a></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Erik Schön</strong>:I was listening to and watching another episode on <a href="https://gotopia.tech/bookclub/episodes/upgrade-your-frontend-game-be-an-elm-wizard">Elm in Action</a>. Elm is a totally different beast, of course. But what I found interesting in there is the approach taken to static typing. Which is very, very rigid. What are your thoughts on static typing for the BEAM and BEAM languages?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Saša Jurić</strong>: In my view, the lack of static typing is the biggest deficiency in BEAM languages. I know that there are like camps dynamic versus static. I've personally done both for like many, many years. For the past 15 years, I've been mostly using dynamic languages. I'm now pretty much certain to say that I believe that static is definitely a better option. I still love Erlang and Elixir. These are like my first languages, regardless of the lack of static typing because they offer something that I cannot find anywhere else, but I would love to see static typing stories on BEAM languages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, mostly, it hasn't been available. So what we have for Erlang and Elixir is what is called the success typing through the tool called Dialyzer, which I like to say is far from perfect but it's the best we got. However, there are initiatives, very interesting initiatives. There's one language called Alpaca and another language called Gleam, which looked very, very promising. They basically are aimed to bring static typing into the BEAM world, like, proper on static typing. This is something I'm super excited about. I still didn't have the chance to try them out but I will definitely love to see how this story unfolds.<br></p>

<p>
This is my take on differences between <b>Microservices Architecture (MSA)</b> and <b>Services Oriented Architecture (SOA)</b> based on my experience of working with these architectural styles thus far. I do understand that there are companies that doesn't distinguish between these two architecture lingos and use them interchangeable. And then there are also companies that have their own definitions of how each of these architectural styles are modeled. There is no right or wrong definition here (Ouch!, the world became chaotic even before we realized). What truly matters is that knowing our audience as we speak to them. It is unwarranted chaos when our mental models are different.
</p>
<p>So, at the very outset let me state clearly that I see these models differently by virtue of my experience. So this post is my perspective on the difference between these two architectural patterns as I had experienced it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oZyFTlkVYck/XyQUKprpuyI/AAAAAAAAEwE/NaLxhQs0bcEdTADEKHc4RyYjfOXI8wv1gCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/lion-vs-wild-dogs.jpg" width="640"></p>
<div>
	<ul>
		<br>
		<li>SOA is monolithic solution like a big lion in the jungle; how it works would be pretty evident for a pair of eyes.
			<br>MSA is distributed system constituting a set of services working together as one, like a pack of wild dogs working together to attack its target; how it works together would seem like a magic for a pair of eyes.<br></li>
		<br>
		<li>SOA is layered. The app is broken into independent functional modules owned by respective teams. In the Java EE world, each team owning the module builds and publishes its artifacts as libraries for consumption by the core app. The application thus remains monolithic, so any changes to a module meant building and deploying the entire application. This also means that the release of functional modules needs to be coordinated with that of the main application. At least that is how the teams I had been in had build the big monolithic enterprise application, the SOA way.
			<br>MSA is about breaking the large monolithic app into independently deploy-able application where the teams owning it can have its own release cadence; although the larger release of the application still requires some bit of coordinated efforts.</li>
		<br>
		<li>SOA standardizes on shared release cadence requiring larger project planning to keep teams occupied and syncing efforts across teams.
			<br>MSA liberates teams to have its own release cadence to meet the needs of the larger release cycle of the application.</li>
		<br>
		<li>SOA is externally focussed. It was intended to solving communication gaps with 3rd-party heterogeneous systems in a safe, secure and vendor neutral way. More often than not, the communication was outside of the trusted networks.
			<br>MSA is internally focussed. It lays emphasis on building small and independently deployable applications that work together, for faster development and deployment of business needs. The inter-app communication challenge was a consequence of this decision. Typically, the coordinating apps are within the trusted network of the company.</li>
      <br>
		<li>Refactoring across bounded context is relatively simpler with SOA.
          	<br>Refactoring across bounded context is harder with MSA. This is one of the key reasons I don't recommend Microservices First Architecture, but yeah, you can always hit a middle ground that is there somewhere.&nbsp;</li>
		<br>
		<li>SOA embraced SOAP as the de-facto communication protocol and later went on to support REST protocol too.
			<br>MSA embraced REST as the de-facto communication protocol, but is pretty open to embracing other newer protocols for good. Inherently though, there is a dislike for SOAP/XML within the MSA community :)</li>
		<br>
		<li>SOA solved the integration challenges for businesses primarily in the B2B space.<br>MSA solved the delivery challenges for businesses that wanted to be nimble with faster release cycles; historically, to respond to its B2C customers.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>

<p>The shares of Alphabet , Amazon (AMZN) , Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) responded to the announcement of unexpectedly good quarterly figures for the four tech companies in pre-market trading session on Friday. As a result, the shares were close to their respective record highs (Amazon and Alphabet) or even higher (Apple and Facebook).</p>



<p>And during the FB earnings conference call from Thursday, July 30, CEO of Facebook Inc talked, among other things, about the future of remote work within the Company. He said that even before COVID Facebook had a long-term goal of enabling more remote work since the ability to feel present even when you’re remote is a core aspect of their own product work on video presence, workplace and virtual and augmented reality. </p>



<blockquote><p>“the reason why we’re shifting to more remote work is that we think that culturally, it will allow us to attract more talented people. We’re not doing this primarily as a cost-saving measure.”-Mark ZuckeRberg</p></blockquote>



<p>He added that Facebook is:”using this moment to accelerate these plans. And I expect that up to 50% of our employees will be remote long term within the next 5 to 10 years. This will enable us to attract and retain broader pools of talent regardless of where they live.”</p>



<p>David Wehner, Facebook CFO also touched this topic and said:”We had our <strong>strongest hiring quarter ever in Q2</strong>, adding over 4,200 net new hires, primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 52,500 full-time employees, up 32% year-over-year.” and continued on remote work “The main thing we’re trying to do is access a greater talent pool, which ultimately might give us more opportunity to grow head count. So I think there’s an effect there that’s, I think, in addition to cost in the sense that we would have a greater pool of people that we could recruit from.”.</p>



<p>Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB) price went up 7% in the pre-amrket session on Friday which is more than $16.00 higher then Thursday afternoon.</p>



<p>At the same time, the number of users continued to rise rapidly: in the past quarter, FB added more than 100 million monthly active user – and now there are a total of 2.6 billion. At nearly $ 5.2 billion, the profit was about twice as high as in the same quarter of the previous year.</p>

<p>Google Cloud sits a distant third in the cloud wars (ignoring the Chinese cloud companies, which are pretty much irrelevant to Western markets as they face a Huawei-or-the-highway reckoning). With a cloud infrastructure business generally estimated to be between a quarter or a third the size of Microsoft Azure, which in turn is about half the size of Amazon Web Services, Google has a lot of ground to make up. And they’ve been tilting at the infrastructure space since 2008.</p>



<p>You’d think AWS would have bigger worries than Google Cloud. Yet the recent AWS lawsuit against Brian Hall built up Google Cloud as a serious competitive threat to the industry leader. A thin-skinned AWS <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-sues-former-aws-marketing-vp-brian-hall-accepts-google-cloud-job/">sued</a> Hall, claiming he violated his non-compete agreement by joining Google Cloud after leaving AWS. The suit exalted Brian as a god-like marketer (he is pretty good). But it got ridiculous, focusing on Brian’s slide creation skills (which was ironic for a company that prides itself on <a href="https://www.inc.com/carmine-gallo/jeff-bezos-bans-powerpoint-in-meetings-his-replacement-is-brilliant.html">not</a> using slides – except when they <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-reinvent-slides-posted/">do</a> for hours on end, and then <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1272737141424963585?s=20">struggle</a> with some of the basics), and conjectured (under oath) that just a few of Brian’s slides could radically reshape what is apparently a very precarious cloud industry.</p>



<p>The suit also highlighted the overly broad non-competes Amazon asks employees to sign and its haphazard enforcement of those agreements. After a month of terrible press for AWS that broadcast the risks any potential employee takes working for the company, they came to an undisclosed <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-settles-lawsuit-former-aws-marketing-vp-joined-google-cloud/">settlement</a> and Brian promptly assumed his job at Google working for Thomas Kurian (Google Cloud’s newish leader and now recovering Oracle lifer).</p>



<p>I know and have worked with Brian (and am sure he’s horrified by this post), and supported him during the lawsuit (amicus Twitter). He’s an outstanding executive, a creative and clear-thinking marketer, and a high-integrity human. And his slide chops live up to their acclaim – I’ve seen him conjure up over $50 billion in value with slides on a Saturday afternoon that came to fruition and then some.</p>



<p>I’m increasingly fixated on deciphering company cultures (strategy becomes culture at successful technology companies, and then that culture inhibits the evolution of strategy) and using that perspective to handicap future prospects. Google Cloud is as good a place to start as any, as it has some deep and perhaps intractable cultural issues. As Brian tries to get Google Cloud out of their third-place rut, lets see what he is up against.</p>



<h2><strong>It’s a Hobby</strong></h2>



<p>Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/how-an-argument-with-steve-jobs-explains-the-future-of-apple">introduced</a> the idea that trillion-dollar technology behemoths can have hobbies. By describing Apple TV as a hobby, the company restrained expectations and signaled it wasn’t core to Apple’s business. Apple TV was merely something to putter around with in the Apple Park garden after a particularly arduous week in the smartphone wars.</p>



<p>Google Cloud Platform is also a hobby, even if Google doesn’t admit it (they may not even realize it). When Google CEO Sundar Pichai gets up in the morning, the broader Google Cloud business (including G Suite) is, on a really good day, a distant fifth on his list of concerns. The four business segments ahead of it collectively constitute Google’s advertising franchise – search, YouTube, AdSense and Android – which are a mutually reinforcing magical money machine that generated about $150 billion in revenue last year (with very attractive margins).</p>



<p>Sundar’s attention is disproportionately on the advertising franchise as he circles the wagons against a pandemic ravaging (among other things) advertising spending, his fellow members of the avaricious online advertising oligopoly, and a barrage of regulatory and antitrust actions. The broader Google Cloud –both G Suite and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure services – was less than 7% of Google’s overall revenue in the first quarter of 2020. It just isn’t existential for the company.</p>



<p>Despite being a hobby, Apple TV exploits the same skill set and assets Apple employs in its day job. It is an integrated hardware and software product that leverages the company’s silicon, software, and services platforms. Apple TV sells to the same consumers through the same distribution channels, and deepens the customer’s ecosystem attachment to Apple.</p>



<p>Google Cloud not so much: it is an outlier and disjoint in almost every way from the rest of Google. It targets an alien and difficult to please customer in enterprise IT. It requires a completely different partner ecosystem and a completely different business model that is almost antithetical to the advertising business model. It requires dissimilar talent to build, sell, and support that is not particularly fungible with the rest of the company. Google Cloud even requires infrastructure increasingly divergent from Google’s alien mothership infrastructure.</p>



<p>The degree of difficulty to build an enterprise cloud business, never mind a market leader, is very high. It is even harder to build one within an advertising company. Expensive hobbies that cost real money by even Google standards are hard to sustain, so material progress is required. Google management appears to have put Google Cloud on a PIP, giving them a limited window in which to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-brass-set-2023-as-deadline-to-beat-amazon-microsoft-in-cloud">become a market leader or risk defunding</a>. Can this peripheral business for Google rise to the top in cloud infrastructure? After over a decade in this market that hasn’t’t lived up to Google’s ambitions, what has to change and what can change to deliver a different result?</p>



<h2><strong>Losing Their “Googleyness”</strong></h2>



<p>Google in many ways invented cloud computing for their search business. And they did it in bold and unconventional fashion – not by using what were considered the most advanced computing technologies of the day – but by taking a greenfield and sui generis approach to construct an entirely new computing model melding novel software like containers, Borg, and MapReduce with commodity hardware.</p>



<p>What is the point of a Google Cloud that is losing its iconoclastic approach and turning into a me-too amalgam of AWS and Oracle slavishly chasing the market leaders? A product portfolio that increasingly <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/compare/aws/">sees itself</a> through the lens of the atomistic AWS product line combined with an Oracle sales culture is – to put it mildly – hard to get excited about. And GOracle may be overindexing on databases at the expense of everything else. The last thing the world needs is another also-ran cloud company whose use of the word “enterprise” is inversely correlated with their market performance (after all, we already have both <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/07/follow-the-capex-clown-watch/">IBM and Oracle</a>).</p>



<p>The “Googleyness” of the early Google Cloud was pioneering and unique enough to perhaps warrant overlooking their very <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2016/03/googles-scalability-day/">underdeveloped customer skills</a>, at least for a while. They might have matured beyond simply telling customers to get smarter and found a distinctive and complementary go-to-market approach, instead of remaking themselves in Oracle’s image. But that “we-come-from-the-future” inventiveness seems largely in the past, particularly amid an exodus of engineers out of the cloud group. The platitudinous new Google Cloud <a href="https://twitter.com/caro_milanesi/status/1283073424924057600/photo/1">mission statement</a> seems unlikely to uncork a deep well of future innovation (did someone win a bet for getting “digitally transform” into the final version or was that a placeholder they forgot to update or what?).</p>



<p>Google these days seems more focused on relitigating historical battles than pushing the infrastructure frontier. They are grappling with deep neuroses from both Hadoop and Kubernetes, having failed to reap the associated credit and financial rewards they believe they deserved. The company’s previous open source idealism has run <a href="https://thenewstack.io/op-ed-kubernetes-may-be-googles-last-great-open-project/">smack</a> into both ego and the financial constraints under which Google Cloud now operates.</p>



<p>Between Google Cloud’s hobby status and being in the midst of an identity crisis, Brian has his work cut out for him. But cloud infrastructure is an enormous market with lots of growth still ahead of it, Google is investing heavily, and perhaps with better slides, they could move up in the standings?</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.byteant.com/internet-of-things-development-services" target="_blank">Internet of Things, or IoT for short</a>, is a promising branch of technology that together withÂ&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.byteant.com/blog/7-ways-how-big-data-can-supercharge-your-business/" target="_blank">Big Data</a> is conquering the digital world now. The idea of smart interrelated gadgets and consumer electronics able to work independently has been evolving since the end of the 20th century. This technology has successfully resulted in a highly-developed far-reaching system of middleware between the devices and user applications. The universal popularity of the IoT strategy is easily explained by the fact that there are billions of devices worldwide in all aspects of human life: medicine, industry, commerce, farming, lifestyle, to name just a few.</p>

<p>You should bear in mind, though, that open source solutions are not totally equal to free software. The terms may mean the same and are used interchangeably sometimes. However, open source software (OSS) goes both ways: it can come to you at no cost as well as offer you quite expensive price tags. The difference lies in its open nature of the software development approach as it allows side code enthusiasts to easily join the programming process.</p>

Quite obviously, some organizations opt for having the competitive IoT-backed solutions integrated with their processes, like these actionable use cases for <a href="https://www.byteant.com/blog/case-study-iot-and-saas-solutions-for-auto-repair-startup/">Automobile</a> and <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.byteant.com/blog/case-study-how-iot-and-bigdata-transform-sports-industry/" target="_blank">Sports </a>industries. Some decide to double down on buying out or creating their own open source platforms to maximize revenues. Either way, it leads us to the exponential increase of software development initiatives driven by IoT. Hereâ€™s a list of some facts that just add fuel to the fire of IoT-based potential.

<h2>Utilizing OSS: Some benefits and drawbacks explained</h2>
<p>At first glance, the IoT tools mentioned above may seem quite similar and enlist homogeneous features but these platforms can come in handy going far beyond. Alternatively to proprietary software, open source technologies are completely customizable and scalable â€“ as the code is open it can be adjusted and modified to the businesses needs. OSS allows developers and enterprises to move between different frameworks without complications â€“ the necessary toolkit provided.</p>
<p>With a great number of automated protocols and functions, open source frameworks save much time of IoT engineers and tech-professionals. This IoT solution is better for handling deployment flexibility issues and reducing expenses. Being of the major priority, data privacy and security is the main standpoint of any business, so you may choose from diverse open source framework vendors worldwide.</p>
<p>There are still some challenges you can face on this far-reaching way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open means free access, i.e. contributors are not always specialists.</li>
<li>Secure maintenance is always vulnerable.</li>
<li>Data privacy gains a growing legal interest.</li>
<li>A number of best open source platforms may cost a fortune.</li>
<li>Bugs happen.</li>
<li>The set of available standard features doesnâ€™t fit all your business needs.</li>
<li>Open source IoT platforms are not for a mediocre user.</li>
</ul>

				<p><em>I have built a custom search functionality for this blog,
based on Java and the Apache Lucene full-text search library,
compiled into a native binary using the Quarkus framework and GraalVM.
It is deployed as a Serverless application running on AWS Lambda,
providing search results without any significant cold start delay.
If you thought Java wouldn’t be the right language for this job, keep reading;
in this post I’m going to give an overview over the implementation of this feature and my learnings along the way.</em></p>
<p>Having a search functionality for my blog has been on my mind for quite some time;
I’d like to give users the opportunity to find specific contents on this blog right here on this site, without having to use an external search engine.
That’s not only nice in terms of user experience, but also having insight into the kind of information readers look for on this blog should help me to identify interesting things to write about in the future.</p>
<p>Now this blog is a static site — generated using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> — which makes this an interesting challenge.
I didn’t want to rely on an external search service
(see "Why No External Search Service" below for the reasoning),
and also a purely client-side solution as described in this <a href="https://endler.dev/2019/tinysearch/">excellent blog post</a> didn’t seem ideal.
While technically fascinating, I didn’t like the fact that it requires shipping the entire search index to the client for executing search queries.
Also things like result highlighting, customized result scoring, word stemming, fuzzy search and more seemed a bit more than I’d be willing to implement on the client.</p>
<p>All these issues have largely been solved on the server-side by libraries such as <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a> for quite some time.
Using a library like Lucene means implementing a custom server-side process, though.
How to deploy such service?
Operating a VM 24/7 with my search backend for what’s likely going to be not more than a few dozen queries per month seemed a bit like overkill.</p>
<p>So after some consideration I decided to implement my own search functionality,
based on the highly popular Apache Lucene library,
deployed as a Serverless application,
which is started on-demand if a user runs a query on my website.
In the remainder of this post I’m going to describe the solution I came up with and how it works.</p>
<p>If you like, you can try it out right now, this post is about this little search input control at the top right of this page!</p>

<p>Why No External Search Service?</p>
<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1284925378868518913">tweeting</a> about my serverless search experiment, one of the questions was "What’s wrong with <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>?".
To be very clear, there’s nothing wrong with it at all.
External search services like Algolia, <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search">Google Custom Search</a>, or an Elasticsearch provider such as <a href="https://bonsai.io/">Bonsai</a> promise an easy-to-use, turn-key search functionality which can be a great choice for your specific use case.</p>
<p>However, I felt that none of these options would provide me the degree of control and customizability I was after.
I also ruled out any "free" options, as they’d either mean having ads or paying for the service with the data of myself or that of my readers.
And to be honest, I also just fancied the prospect of solving the problem by myself, instead of relying on an off-the-shelf solution.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_why_serverless">Why Serverless?</h2>
<div>
<p>First of all, let’s discuss why I opted for a Serverless solution.
It boils down to three reasons:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Security:</em> While it’d only cost a few EUR per month to set up a VM with a cloud provider like Digital Ocean or Hetzner, having to manage a full operating system installation would require too much of my attention; I don’t want someone to mine bitcoins or doing other nasty things on a box I run, just because I failed to apply some security patch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cost:</em> Serverless does not only promise to scale-out (and let’s be honest, there likely won’t be millions of search queries on my blog every month), but also scale-to-zero.
As Serverless is pay-per-use and there are free tiers in place e.g. for AWS Lambda,
this service ideally should cost me just a few cents per month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Learning Opportunity:</em> Last but not least, this also should be a nice occasion for me to dive into the world of Serverless, by means of designing, developing and running a solution for a real-world problem, exploring how Java as my preferred programming language can be used for this task</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_solution_overview">Solution Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>The overall idea is quite simple: there’s a simple HTTP service which takes a query string,
runs the query against a Lucene index with my blog’s contents and returns the search results to the caller.
This service gets invoked via JavaScript from my static blog pages,
where results are shown to the user.</p>
<p>The Lucene search index is read-only and gets rebuilt whenever I update the blog.
It’s baked into the search service deployment package,
which that way becomes fully immutable.
This reduces complexities and the attack surface at runtime.
Surely that’s not an approach that’s viable for more dynamic use cases,
but for a blog that’s updated every few weeks, it’s perfect.
Here’s a visualization of the overall flow:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.morling.dev/images/serverless_search_overview.png" alt="Serverless Search Solution Overview">
</p>
</div>
<p>The search service is deployed as a Serverless function on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>.
One important design goal for me is to avoid lock-in to any specific cloud provider:
the solution should be portable and also be usable with container-based Serverless approaches like <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a>.</p>
<p>Relying on a Serverless architecture means its start-up time must be a matter of milli-seconds rather than seconds,
so to not have a user wait for a noticeable amount of time in case of a cold start.
While <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/building-class-data-sharing-archives-with-apache-maven/">substantial improvements</a> have been made in recent Java versions to improve start-up times,
it’s still not ideal for this kind of use case.
Therefore, the application is compiled into a native binary via <a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus</a> and <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>,
which results in a start-up time of ~30 ms on my laptop, and ~180 ms when deployed to AWS Lambda.
With that we’re in a range where a cold start won’t impact the user experience in any significant way.</p>
<p>The Lambda function is exposed to callers via the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway</a>,
which takes incoming HTTP requests, maps them to calls of the function and converts its response into an HTTP response which is sent back to the caller.</p>
<p>Now let’s dive down a bit more into the specific parts of the solution.
Overall, there are four steps involved:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_data_extraction">Data extraction:</a></em> The blog contents to be indexed must be extracted and converted into an easy-to-process data format</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_search_backend_implementation">Search backend implementation:</a></em> A small HTTP service is needed which exposes the search functionality of Apache Lucene, which in particular requires some steps to enable Lucene being used in a native GraalVM binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_wiring_things_up">Integration with the website:</a></em> The search service must be integrated into the static site on GitHub Pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_deployment_to_aws_lambda">Deployment:</a></em> Finally, the search service needs to be deployed to AWS API Gateway and Lambda</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>The first step was to obtain the contents of my blog in an easily processable format.
Instead of requiring something like a real search engine’s crawler,
I essentially only needed to have a single file in a structured format which then can be passed on to the Lucene indexer.</p>
<p>This task proved rather easy with Hugo;
by means of a <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/#output-formats-for-pages">custom output format</a> it’s straight-forward to produce a JSON file which contains the text of all my blog pages.
In my <em>config.toml</em> I declared the new output format and activate it for the homepage
(largely inspired by this <a href="https://xdeb.org/post/2017/06/11/make-hugo-generate-a-json-search-index-and-json-feed/">write-up</a>):</p>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>The template in <em>layouts/_default/list.searchindex.json</em> isn’t too complex either:</p>

<div>
<pre><code>{{- $.Scratch.Add "searchindex" slice -}}
{{- range $index, $element := .Site.Pages -}}

<p>My stack of choice for this kind of application is Quarkus.
As a <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-streams-guide">contributor</a>, I am of course biased, but Quarkus is ideal for the task at hand:
built and optimized from the ground up for implementing fast-starting and memory-efficient cloud-native and Serverless applications,
it makes building HTTP services, e.g. based on JAX-RS, running on GraalVM a trivial effort.</p>
<p>Now typically a Java library such as Lucene will not run in a GraalVM native binary out-of-the-box.
Things like reflection or JNI usage require specific configuration,
while other Java features like method handles are only supported partly or not at all.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_apache_lucene_in_a_graalvm_native_binary">Apache Lucene in a GraalVM Native Binary</h3>
<p>Quarkus enables a wide range of popular Java libraries to be used with GraalVM,
but at this point there’s no extension yet which would take care of Lucene.
So I set out to implement a small Quarkus extension for Lucene.
Depending on the implementation details of the library in question, this can be a more or less complex and time-consuming endeavor.
The workflow is like so:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>compile down an application using the library into a native image</p>

<p>run into some sort of …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainContentOfPage">
		
<p>Many applications today still rely on traditional SQL databases like MySQL, MariaDb or PostgreSQL for data storage and data processing. With the growing amount of data and new workloads that are made with this database systems, we often find ourselves in situations where we need to think about scaling such systems.</p>



<p>When it comes to scaling, we might need to think about:</p>



<ul><li>data storage, if we store more and more data and it becomes expensive or slow working with them</li><li>fast INSERTs and UPDATES for write-heavy workloads</li><li>making SELECT queries faster because of their complexity or because they need to query huge amounts of data</li><li>concurrency if we have many clients interacting with the database</li></ul>



<p>In this article, I will present some basic ideas and starting points on scaling traditional SQL databases.</p>



<h3>Update the database</h3>



<p>Newer versions of MySQL, PostgreSQL and other traditional SQL databases typically come with performance improvements. Even if the newer database system is not faster as a direct replacement, there might be new features available that we can take advantage of. Keeping our database system up to date expands our options on what we can do with our data and gives us the best out of the box performance. It is a basic enabler for scaling.</p>



<h3>Scale vertically</h3>



<p>The most intuitive idea of scaling is to use better hardware to scale vertically (on one database server). When it comes to hardware we typically look at CPUs, disk and RAM:</p>



<ul><li>The number of CPUs affects how many queries the database can run and therefore how many clients can be served</li><li>The size of RAM gives us space for indexes, temporary tables and caches the database can store in a fast memory which makes our system faster due to minimizing IO access to disk</li><li>Disk IO speed highly affects the query times, especially for full scan reads (when indexes cannot be used) or for write-heavy systems</li><li>Disk size allows us to store more data</li></ul>



<h3>Leverage application cache</h3>



<p>If the application’s code is in our control we can cache data in a memory store like <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> or <a href="https://memcached.org/">Memcached</a> to avoid querying the database. We don’t have to just cache database reads, but we can also use such systems as buffers for writes, e.g. when we are collecting analytical data and a possible delay is not a problem.</p>



<h3>Use efficient data types</h3>



<p>When it comes to data, it all starts with data types, in other words how individual pieces of information are physically stored in memory. Choosing appropriate data types is always a balance between efficiency and functionality, affecting the required memory, query performance and number of operations we can do with the specific data type.</p>



<p>There are two basic ways to think about optimal data types:</p>



<ul><li>logical: how to store general information like a telephone number or an IP address; for instance we can store color as a string, enum or as a collection of RGB integers and we can store IP address as a string or as bytes</li><li>physical: what specific data types we choose for strings, integers or time since we typically have multiple options; e.g. date and time can be typically stored as a timestamp (faster but with limited date range and functionality) or as a more complex datetime which is more developer friendly and flexible, allowing to store timezone etc.</li></ul>



<p>Using an appropriate type for a database column is especially important when we want to index the column, use it in the WHERE clause, use it for joins or when we have a lot of data.</p>



<h3>Data normalization and denormalization</h3>



<p>We are often trained to normalize data for relational databases in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. While this is generally useful, we might want to reconsider it for some of our data when it comes to scaling.</p>



<p>Generally speaking the simpler we make our data to be retrieved or saved, the more of it we can have.</p>



<h3>Precompute data</h3>



<p>A lot of SELECT queries can be optimized by having the data already in the requested form. This can be handy for analyzing large amounts of data. For instance, instead of aggregating data every time, we can aggregate them beforehand. Of course this isn’t always possible, e.g. we cannot aggregate other average aggregates because we would lose precision.</p>



<h3>Leverage materialized views</h3>



<p>Materialized views are continuously updated data that are updated on write operations or on scheduled time and can be seen as an extension of the previous point. Unlike classic views, materialized views are physically stored and don’t need to be computed when needed. This is useful for situations where a SELECT query would take a long time to produce the result.</p>



<p>As an example, look at <a href="https://www.pipelinedb.com/">PipelineDB</a> extension for PostgreSQL that produces aggregates on real-time data, allowing us to keep aggregated statistics on a write-heavy systems.</p>



<h3>Use proper indexes</h3>



<p>Using the right indexes on tables can be a huge performance changer. Typically, we should index the columns by which we want to query the data or which we want to use to perform joins. However, adding indexes can also reduce performance for write-heavy workloads, since indexes have to be updated on every INSERT and UPDATE. Also it doesn’t make sense to use indexes on some data types. So it is all about finding the right balance.</p>



<h3>Leverage the execution plan for query optimization</h3>



<p>For optimizing reads we need to know how the database query planner will execute our queries. We can use EXPLAIN statement to obtain the execution plan that the SQL server will use for our query.</p>



<p>Here we should look if the database plans to use any of the existing indexes on the tables or plans to make a full table scan. It can give us hints whether we should change the structure of our data, add indexes or rewrite the query in a different way. Please note however that full table scan can be also faster or necessary for some queries so it is not a black and white situation.</p>



<h3>Choose correct transaction isolation level</h3>



<p>The most common relational databases use multi-version concurrency control and make locking very granular (instead of locking the whole table, like MyISAM storage engine does). However, we still need to tell the database how exactly should the concurrency control behave and we can do so by setting appropriate transaction isolation level. There are 4 basic isolation levels in SQL:1992 standard and they will greatly affect how our database system behaves.</p>



<h3>Bulk INSERTs and UPDATEs</h3>



<p>Writing or updating individual rows in a table is not efficient, but databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL have ways to insert or modify data in bulk. We should leverage this every time we can.</p>



<h3>Compress data for storage</h3>



<p>Many times we don’t need to query the data by all the columns in a table. If this is the case, we can further optimize the storage size by storing some of the columns in a compressed form. This is especially useful for strings or some types of binary data.</p>



<p>Some databases or their extensions might be already compressing data under the hood so it always makes sense to look first how the data are stored and whether adding compression on the application layer would bring the desired benefit.</p>



<h3>Make ALTER TABLEs work</h3>



<p>When the amount of data or the workload grows we will experience slower and slower ALTER TABLEs to the point where some of them might not finish in a reasonable time. The first important thing to know is that there are typically two ways of changing the structure of the database tables. One is INPLACE, modifying the original table and the other one is COPY, creating a new table and moving the data afterwards. Databases typically try to modify tables INPLACE if possible, but it might make sense sometimes to explicitly ask for the COPY operation.</p>



<p>When adding a new column, it is better to add it at the end of the table, since inserting a column at a specific place is slow.</p>



<p>When changing existing column it might be a good idea to create a new column first, copy the data and remove the column afterwards.</p>



<p>If the write operations on the table make it difficult to perform ALTER TABLE, it makes sense to stop clients from writing into the table first. This is not always possible, but e.g. collection of analytical data can be postponed using an ingestion buffer in front of the database or we can temporarily pause our ETL jobs working with the table.</p>



<p>The last resort is to simply not do any ALTER TABLEs on large and write-heavy tables, opting for creating a new table to store the new data instead.</p>



<h3>Manage concurrent connections</h3>



<p>Every database server comes with some basic configuration on the maximum number of concurrent connections. When we need more, we typically need to reconfigure this value. Just increasing the value is not enough though – we need to make sure that our system can actually run well with our desired number of connections.</p>



<h3>Add read replicas</h3>



<p>Traditional SQL databases can’t typically scale horizontally for write operations by adding more servers, but we can still add other machines in the form of read-only replicas. The way this works is that all write operations are done on the main server and propagated to other machines using Write Ahead Log. All the replicas will therefore apply the same operations in the same order to the underlying storage as the main server. This ensures that the data will be in sync.</p>



<p>Replicas can be then used for scaling the number of read queries and number of connected clients if they only need read operations.</p>



<h3>Disk partitioning</h3>



<p>Partitioning allows us to distribute one single table across the filesystem and store individual partitions based on some specific rules. When such rules are chosen well, SQL queries don’t have to query all partitions but can limit their search only to a subset of them. This will cut the time the query will run since not the whole database table needs to be looked into.</p>



<h3>Use specialized extensions</h3>



<p>When we need to store and work with geospatial, time series and other …</p></div></div>

Many people are building the same kinds of B2B SaaS web apps or consumer-focused content sites in 2020 that were being built in 2007. There absolutely are deeper technology challenges being tackled, but that's a topic for another day.</p> <p>There really <em>isn't</em> much challenging in building a Reddit clone or a Zendesk clone in 2020. Using a productive framework like Rails, Laravel or Phoenix, a mid-level full-stack dev could crank out an MVP in a day. Even without a such a framework, shipping it over a weekend wouldn't be uncommon.</p> <p>A week ago, I saw an interesting <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23923104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> from an startup-employee and entrepreneur that took the idea a step further:</p> <blockquote><p>I work in early stage product startups.</p> <p>What R&amp;D do you need? CRUD is solved, hosting is solved, UX is solved, scaling is solved, marketing is solved ...</p> <p>Everything to do with web and mobile is very solved at this point. Most problems come from tripping over ourselves and cobbling things together to fit new domains.</p> <p>All real hard R&amp;D happens inside faang these days. At least for web/mobile consumer stuff.</p></blockquote> <h2 id="marketing-is-done"><a href="#marketing-is-done">#</a> Marketing is done</h2> <p>Not only are there frameworks and playbooks for <em>building</em> a polished CRUD web app and/or mobile app, but there frameworks and playbooks for marketing them and selling them, too!</p> <p>Knowledge of how to effectively design an email funnel or run Facebook ads may have been relatively scarce a decade ago, but it sure isn't now! "Everybody" knows how important it is to build an email list, test landing pages, talk to early customers, etc, etc, etc.</p> <p>The secret isn't locked up in a few expensive members-only communities or Silicon Valley-based startups. It's out. It's gone global. There are even fantastic books about getting <a href="https://medium.com/@yegg/78-takeaways-from-traction-book-1b44d2a03dda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Traction</a></p> <h2 id="financing-is-done"><a href="#financing-is-done">#</a> Financing is done</h2> <p>It used to be expensive to build a web app. There weren't many investors willing to put up the money it took. The few that were tended to be highly credentialist.</p> <p>Now it's so cheap that founders are building on the side and keeping their jobs until reaching a replacement salary. Fundraising options have also exploded—traditional investors have multiplied, crowd funding is a force, blockchain-based models are popping up and there are even <a href="https://earnestcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some investors</a> who fund bootstrappers with no intention of <em>ever</em> building a gigantic business.</p> <p>It still doesn't hurt to have gone to Stanford, Harvard or similarly elite institution but it's far less of an uphill struggle for those who haven't in 2020 than it was in the past.</p> <h2 id="the-remaining-question"><a href="#the-remaining-question">#</a> The remaining question</h2> <p>If the skills that were an unfair advantage in the aughts are now widespread, then what <em>is</em> the edge in 2020?</p>  <h2 id=""><a href="#">#</a> <br></h2> <p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?t=%22Everything%22%20is%20done.%20&amp;u=https://questinglog.com/everything-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comment on HN</a></p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Hello, a good reader of my <a href="https://epic.blog/">epic.blog</a>!</p>

<p>On this lovely and streaming hot July day, I wish to take you on a journey of my reverse engineering trip across the mountains of Android and the valleys of decompilers. Pour yourself a cold drink and enjoy this voyage.</p>

<p>So; I wanted to demonstrate how to reverse engineer an Android Application and what tools you can use to achieve this - even without owning an Android Phone.</p>

<p>The app used for this demonstration is called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.molekula.bikekrk">Krk Bike</a>, and it is a mobile application that you can download from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.molekula.bikekrk">Google Play store</a>, and it will show you many of bike trails on <a href="http://www.krk.hr/en/">Croatia’s island of Krk</a>. <em>I wanted to see all of this bike trails in a single, un-cluttered map.</em> How could we get such data out of this app?</p>

<p>When you open up this app on your phone, it looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://epic.blog/assets/2020-07-27-reverse-engineering-android-app/krk-bike-in-play-store.png" alt="krk-bike-in-play-store"></p>

<p>The app itself has detailed trails with paths and pictures plus contacts, and it even comes with small “navigation module” that will guide you through the track while while you are on the route. Pretty decent and slick app. Obviously - dear reader - you’ll choose your own target at some point, but this one is interesting to me. It is definitely a good first step to be familiar with the app as much as possible.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-android-apps-built">How are Android apps built?</h2>

<p>Well. First, you need to understand how Android apps are <strong>built</strong> and <strong>distributed</strong>. Usually, Android developers develop their apps with the help of <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a>, compile them, sign them and upload the “apks” to Google Play Store. The more detailed explanation about the process of building Android apps for beginners and getting them to end-users can be found on <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project">Android documentation page (Create an Android project)</a>.</p>

<p>Hold on, mister! ✋How are apps compiled, and how do they even run?</p>

<p>Now that you’ve asked. In a nutshell. Usually, Android apps are compiled in a few stages. The first stage; depending on your source code gets compiled either with Java compiler or Kotlin compiler to Java bytecode. These compilers spit-out <code>*.class</code> files. The <code>*.class</code> files are then fed into DX (<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/d8">DEX compiler - <code>d8</code></a>). DEX compiler spits out DEX bytecode that runs on Android devices, and it allows you to use Java 8 language features in your app’s code. DEX bytecode is then something that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_(software)">Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM for short)</a> actually runs your app.</p>

<p><img src="https://epic.blog/assets/2020-07-27-reverse-engineering-android-app/android-app/compilation.png" alt="compilation"></p>

<p>Now; if you know anything about Android. You’re likely to say: “Sorry, Oto! Old news! DVM is deprecated since KitKat.” And you would be right! Dalvik has been replaced with something much more magical - called Android Runtime (ART for short). But few core concepts are the same, just better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The successor of Dalvik is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Runtime">Android Runtime</a> (ART), which uses the same bytecode and .dex files (but not .odex files), with the succession aiming at performance improvements transparent to the end users. The new runtime environment was included for the first time in Android 4.4 “KitKat” as a technology preview, and replaced Dalvik entirely in later versions; Android 5.0 “Lollipop” is the first version in which ART is the only included runtime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok; so the next step in the building process for any Android app is to package it into something that is called <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files">APK</a>. An <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files">Android Package Kit (APK for short)</a> is the package file format used by the Android operating system for distribution and installation of mobile apps. Think of it as a package with some more meta-information attached, sophisticated Java <code>*.jar</code> or Debian’s <code>*.deb</code> package.</p>

<p>After developers successfully build these APK’s they “push” them to devices or to Google Play Store. If its development process, that’s usually done via <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb"><code>adb</code></a> in command-line (or Android Studio will use something similar in the background for you). If its production release, people sometimes also <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing">sign these things</a> with their keys either with <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> or with <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apksigner"><code>apksigner</code></a> via CLI directly. The Android system uses the certificate as a means of identifying the author of an application and establishing trust relationships between applications.</p>

<p>Ok, now that you know how apps are built, packaged and pushed to store,…</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-get-apk-of-an-app-from-google-play-store">How can I get APK of an app from Google Play Store?</h2>

<p>There are multiple ways you can get APK of any given Android App. The most trivial is to use one of multiple “mirror” sites that collect these APKs. Sometimes they automate the process and sometimes - as I found out via my uber Googling skills - they just have people fetch populat APKs manually. To name a few of these <a href="https://apkpure.com/">apkpure.com</a>, <a href="https://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/">evozi APK Downlowder</a> and <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/">apkmirror.com</a>. These sites have few disadvantages; the foremost being that not “all” apk’s that are on Google Play Store is available, and that this is a “mirror” site and there is no way of assuring that these apk’s and Apps that these belong to are untempered. Although hard, it is possible to inject malicious code and spread it via these or similar sites.</p>

<h3 id="-but-they-dont-have-my-app-there">… but they don’t have my app there!</h3>

<p>Oh, yeah. In that case, you can do what I did. You can</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a> on your machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get Android-x86 OS image from <a href="https://www.osboxes.org/android-x86/">OSBoxes.org (follow this link)</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bootup the Android image and then go to Google Play Store,…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>then install the app you wanna look into.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>after app installs, download an app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yschi.MyAppSharer">MyAppSharer</a>.</p>

    <p>I stored the APK of targeted app into <code>/storage/emulated/0/</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at this point, you can either install Android tools on your machine and then use adb to pull apk to host machine with following command. <strong>Or</strong> you can creativly just email yourself apk from MyAppSherer app in the emulator. (lol)</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>adb pull /storage/emulated/0/hr.molekula.bikekrk.apk
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, I wish to clarify a few things. Although for a given example this works; Android-x86 is an open-source effort to port Android to x86 architecture. An experiment that has now also extended beyond the primary x86 platform. Please make sure you visit their site and <a href="https://www.android-x86.org/donate.html">buy them a coffee</a> if you like the project. Second. There are also other ways where you could pull apk from an Android phone or emulator, but I found all of them to be hard or unreliable, so that’s why I’m sharing this app here.</p>

<h2 id="i-have-the-apk--now-what-">I have the APK! ✅ Now what? 🤔</h2>

<p>After you obtain the APK of an app that you wish to peek into. The next step is to decompile <code>*.apk</code> into something useful. i.e. <code>*.java</code> source code. The decompilation process of Android source code is usually a two-step process. First, you unpack raw APK back to “files”, then those dalvik codes (<code>*.smil</code>) needs to be converted back to Java classes. Note at this stage. Compilation usually means trimming some characters, names and also introducing some optimisations, so by no means expect that the decompiled code will match back to original source code. But in general, it is good enough that an expert will be able to figure out what is going on.</p>

<p><img src="https://epic.blog/assets/2020-07-27-reverse-engineering-android-app/android-app/decompilation.png" alt="decompilation"></p>

<p>In other to do that there are several open-source tools available that you can use. For this experiment, I’ve used these. Some of them are pretty basic, and very Android specific, others however, like NSA’s Ghidra are more general purpose reverse engineering tools.</p>

<h3 id="apktool">Apktool</h3>

<p>This reverse engineering tool is the most probably most sophisticated and Android specific from this list and it can disassemble resources nearly to the original; including XMLs, images and other assets.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>java <span>-jar</span> apktool_2.4.1.jar d hr.molekula.bikekrk.apk
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run this tool it will spit out tree-structure of the original app that looks something like this; please note that it does not convert *.smil files back to Java source code. But it does an incredible job with other resources.</p>

<p><img src="https://epic.blog/assets/2020-07-27-reverse-engineering-android-app/apktool-files.png" alt="apktool-files"></p>

<h3 id="java-decompiler">Java Decompiler</h3>

<p>This decompiler can be used practically on any Java application. If comes in tree flaveours. JD-GUI, the variation with user interface, JD-Eclipse as an plugin for Eclipse IDE and JD-Core as an lib.</p>

<p>The small gotcha with <a href="http://java-decompiler.github.io/">Java Decompiler</a> is that you need to convert your APK to JAR before it can be decompiled and inspected by it. To do that you need to geta tool called <a href="https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar">dex2jar</a> that will help you construct JAR.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>./dex2jar-2.0/d2j-dex2jar.sh <span>-f</span> hr.molekula.bikekrk.apk <span># for DEX -&gt; JAR</span>
java <span>-jar</span> jd-gui-1.6.6.jar <span># to bootup Java Decompiler GUI</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://epic.blog/assets/2020-07-27-reverse-engineering-android-app/jd-gui.png" alt="jd-gui"></p>

<h3 id="jadx">JADX</h3>

<p>This tool is very likely the most “for Android” that I’ve found and managed to use. It can be used with GUI or purely from CLI. It can also run directly on APK / DEX combo without the extra step like <a href="http://java-decompiler.github.io/">Java Decompiler</a> mentioned early. It has also magical ability to deal with deobfuscation and from what I can tell the best full text search, decleartion jumping and usage lookup. When ran; it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://epic.blog/assets/2020-07-27-reverse-engineering-android-app/jadx-gui.png" alt="jadx-gui"></p>

<h3 id="ghidra">Ghidra</h3>

<p>Although I originaly explored tools that are very Android or Java specific. I also get a recommendation from a friend to look into usage of <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a>, a more general purpose software reverse engineering (SRE) suite of tools developed by NSA’s Research Directorate in support of the Cybersecurity mission.</p>

<p>Initially if feels a bit cluncky, and although it should work directly on *.APK’s I had to covert APK to JAR with <a href="https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar">dex2jar</a> the same way as I did with <a href="https://github.com/skylot/jadx">JADX</a> before I could use it. There are other ways you could also just load <code>classes.dex</code> via “file system” import that I later found to also works.</p>

<p><img src="https://epic.blog/assets/2020-07-27-reverse-engineering-android-app/ghidra.png" alt="ghidra"></p>

<p>Ghidra is <strong>definitly next level</strong> when it comes to reverse engineering and the toolbox seems to have everything and even more than a human might need for a simple experiment like the one I’m trying to demonstrate here.</p>

<h3 id="javadecompilerscom">javadecompilers.com</h3>

<p>In some cases you even might not need to install any of these tools and frameworks and you can just use the online solution like <a href="http://www.javadecompilers.com/">javadecompilers.com</a>. Alghouth bit cumbersone; it can still be used to look into simple Java / Android apps.</p>

<p><img src="https://epic.blog/assets/2020-07-27-reverse-engineering-android-app/javadecompilers.png" alt="javadecompilers"></p>

<h2 id="i-have-the-source--now-what-">I have the source. ✅ Now what?! 💡</h2>

<p>After you’ve successfully obtained the source code with decompilation process the next step is to probably <strong>limit the scope of your investigation</strong> and start reading the code. In my case I was looking for two things; how does the app connect to the web service that exposes “tracks” and for the coordinates of the …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-74186e655e714d161036"><div><p>For 500 days in a row, I’ve written 500 words of Morning Pages. If you’ve never heard of Morning Pages, it’s a fancy way to say journaling. Every morning, I type out anything and everything that’s on my mind.  </p><p>Most mornings are brain dumps to clear my head and get on with the day. But I sometimes like to reflect on specific questions. Over the years, I’ve found there are 10 questions that help me reflect or work through any problem. </p><p>If you’re interested, I’ve aggregated each of these questions into a nicely formatted template. If you drop your email in the box at the bottom, I’ll shoot it your way. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596196579571_53349"><div><h3>1. How am I complicit in creating the conditions I say I don’t want?</h3><p>This question is a staple for me. On the first Sunday of every month, I’ll sit down and truthfully answer this question. </p><p>This questions helps me identify where my actions aren’t matching my words. I’ll often say I want to do things a certain way on paper, but then fail to do them that way. By answering this question, I can see where I’m lying to myself.</p><p>This question comes from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0rSG9ysPbrSu5iBfCYaRFQ?si=xmLVxlEERUKwp_U7wkOUNw"><strong>Episode #373 of the Tim Ferriss Show with professional coach Jerry Colonna</strong></a>. This episode is loaded with questions and ideas that will leave you more reflective and curious. </p><h3>2. Where am I feeling the Resistance?</h3><p>Every Monday morning, I ask myself this question. If you’ve never heard of the Resistance, you should read <a href="https://dickiebush.com/book-notes/resistance"><strong>Stephen Pressfield’s The War of Art</strong></a> today. It’s the most influential book on my productivity and motivation I’ve ever read. </p><blockquote><p>What elicits the Resistance?&nbsp;<strong>Any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity</strong>.&nbsp;Or, expressed another way, any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower. Any of these will elicit Resistance.</p></blockquote><p>You can check out my notes on The War of Art <a href="https://dickiebush.com/book-notes/resistance"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h3>3. What would I do to make today horrible?</h3><p>This question leverages the <a href="https://www.dickiebush.com/articles/inversion-mental-model-munger"><strong>Inversion Principle</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Avoiding poor decisions is easier than making the right ones. So instead of thinking of everything I want to do that day, I think of everything I could do to make today horrible. Then I just avoid doing those. </p><h3>4. Where am I making things more complex than they need to be?</h3><p>I sometimes make simple things more complex than they need to be. Overcomplication creates billion-dollar industries. But most solutions are simple and deserve no more than a tweet’s worth of text.</p><p>For a deep dive into why we overcomplicate things (and how to stop doing so), check out this <a href="https://t.co/GfRs5R2hg6"><strong>deep dive blog post</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><h3>5. What would this look like if it were easy?</h3><p>This is the first of three questions I found in Tim Ferriss’ blog post <a href="https://t.co/HxZazlVFeB"><strong>17 Questions That Changed My Life</strong></a>. </p><p>This question assumes the answer to my problem is easy. I then think of all the ways that might be true. Working backwards this way always shakes up my perspective, leading to new insights. </p><h3>6. What if I did the opposite in every area?</h3><p>I sometimes get stuck in my default way of doing things. To refresh my outlook, I’ll think about what would happen if I started doing everything opposite of how I currently am.</p><p>For example, I recently went 13 weeks on the Carnivore Diet, just to see what happened. So I asked the question - <strong>“What would happen if I went Vegan for 13 weeks?”</strong></p><p>I don’t plan on doing so, but the answers I came up with were more interesting than I thought they’d be. </p><h3>7. If I could only work for four hours this week, what would I work on?</h3><p>I occasionally feel overwhelmed with too many things. This questions helps me identify the highest leverage thing I can work on. It also leverages <a href="https://www.dickiebush.com/articles/parkinsons"><strong>Parkinson’s Law</strong></a><strong>, </strong>adding a creative constraint to better target my attention. </p><h3>8. How could I achieve my 10-year goals in six months?</h3><p>This question is the most fun to answer. On the first Saturday of every month, I’ll give it a whirl. </p><p>Thinking in extremes helps to wash aware any self-imposed limitations. The answers are usually unrealistic. But there have been plenty of times where this change in mindset lead to some insightful ideas. </p><h3>9. How would the type of person I want to become handle this?</h3><p>When faced with a big decision or problem, I ask myself this question to look for a bolder response. Thinking about the best way I could possibly handle something sets a high bar for action. </p><p>This questions comes from a blog post from one of my favorite writers, David Cain. It’s called <a href="https://t.co/AgbFPPkmGb"><strong>How to Get Out of a Rut in 20 Minutes</strong></a><strong> </strong>and is filled with even more reflection questions. </p><h3>10. What would I do if it was impossible for me to fail?</h3><p>Fear of failure is one of the most common self-imposed limitations. Eliminating failure as an option and sincerely asking “what would I do now?” helps me think bigger and bolder.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596196579571_23200"><div><h3>Now it’s your turn</h3><p>I’ve aggregated these questions into a nicely formatted template that you can copy and fill out yourself. If you’re interested, I’ll email it to you along with a few other of my favorite reflection resources. Just fill out this template below. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al. (2013)</span> have since become a standard benchmark in Reinforcement Learning research. The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve. It was only recently <span data-cites="badia_agent57_2020">Badia et al. (2020)</span> <span data-cites="ecoffet_first_2020">Ecoffet et al.

In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output. The canonical example is translation: When producing an output word, it typically maps to one or more specific input words.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a> <span data-cites="kingma_adam_2017">Kingma and Ba (2017)</span></li> </ul> <p><strong><strong>Implementations</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/adam.html">Implementing Adam in Python</a></li> <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/optim/adam.html">PyTorch Adam implementation</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.2.0/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/adam.py#L32-L281">TensorFlow Adam implementation</a></li> </ul> <figure> <img src="https://dennybritz.com/assets/deep-learning-most-important-ideas/optimizer-benchmark.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function, such as the average classification error, using an optimizer.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GPT-3 is an amazing technology. Within a few weeks after beta API access opened, a <a href="https://twitter.com/xuenay/status/1283312640199196673" target="_blank">host of jaw-dropping demos</a> popped up, from <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" target="_blank">automatic code generation</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">automated therapy bots</a> to <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank">writing original poetry and Navy SEAL copypasta memes</a>. It does things that would have been science fiction 10 years ago.&nbsp;GPT-3 and its successor algorithms are going to change entire industries.</p><p>Naturally, tech founders and VC investors are salivating at the possibilities of turning GPT-3 applications into businesses.</p><p>But a good technology doesn’t necessarily make for a good business. <strong>The fact that GPT-3 works so well out of the box should be terrifying to founders.</strong> Here’s why:</p><ul><li>If it’s easy to make a good-enough app out of the box, the barriers to entry are mercilessly low. Dozens of competitors for your idea will spring up literally overnight, as they already have in these Twitter demos.</li><li>It’s not just about new entrants. If GPT-3 is so easy to adopt and build products with, incumbents will do it too. Thus, in Clayton Christensen’s framework, GPT-3 looks more like a <strong>sustaining innovation</strong> than a disruptive innovation. This will strengthen existing winners more than it creates openings for new startups.</li><li>If the baseline GPT-3 performance cannot be substantially improved to create a substantial (10x) proprietary edge, the competition will shift away from technology to other dimensions of competition—particularly in marketing and distribution. This is where incumbents beat startups.</li><li>Meanwhile, the profits will accrue to the true beneficiaries: 1) the algorithm owners,&nbsp; OpenAI (and, by extension, Azure), 2) to marketing platforms, particularly Google and Facebook. Both can raise pricing to the point where companies built on each are barely profitable.</li></ul><p>Let’s dive more into these ideas.</p><h2><span id="Low_Barrier_to_Entry_Fierce_Competition"><strong>Low Barrier to Entry = Fierce Competition</strong></span></h2><div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=471&amp;ssl=1 471w, https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/05/28/moats-before-gross-margins/" target="_blank">Moats provide an enduring competitive advantage</a>. The wider and deeper the moat, the higher the barrier to entry to compete with your business, and the less capably a hotshot teenager can start a new company to compete.</p><p>If a moat is shallow, hundreds of competitors can pop up overnight and provide a good-enough competing product. If you can’t build a meaningful product advantage, then the grounds of competition shift to other dimensions of competition—namely, marketing and distribution.</p><h3><strong>The Parable of Online Mattresses</strong></h3><p>The online mattress industry had shallow moats and played out predictably. A few years ago, if you wanted to start a new mattress company, you only needed to cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A manufacturer</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>At the peak of the industry, there were <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/18/there-are-now-175-online-mattress-companiesand-you-cant-tell-them-apart.html" target="_blank">175 online mattress companies</a>. None had a meaningful product advantage—many used the same mattress manufacturers. (And having personally tried several of these mattresses in stores, they really did feel about the same.)</p><p>The grounds of competition thus shifted to marketing and branding, which is why a year ago you heard so many podcast ads for Casper, Purple, and the like. When product 17 and product 130 are identical, then the only way to win is to get buyers more familiar with product 17. But <strong>when competition meets a narrow dimension of competition, profits evaporate</strong>—companies bid up marketing prices to the highest that they can endure. It became a game of chicken—how much are <em>you </em>willing to spend to acquire a customer? The best-funded startups “won” this branding battle.</p><p>But this was a short-lived victory. <strong>The ultimate result: perpetually unprofitable businesses</strong>, with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cspr/financials" target="_blank">companies spending most of their revenue on COGS and user acquisition</a>. Casper now has a market value of just $350 million, down from its peak private valuation of $1.1 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries of all this funding are:&nbsp;</p><p>1) the companies selling shovels in the gold rush, including mattress manufacturers and marketing platforms (particularly Google and Facebook)</p><p>2) customers, who enjoyed rock-bottom mattress prices subsidized by venture capital.</p><p>This situation played out in meal kit companies too, and one could argue the same is true of Uber vs Lyft and the food delivery war going on now.</p><h2><span id="Can_You_Differentiate_Yourself_with_GPT-3"><strong>Can You Differentiate Yourself with GPT-3?</strong></span></h2><p>Because GPT-3 works so well out of the box, I see this playing out a similar way. To start a new AI company, you need only cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A product built on GPT-3’s (very easy to use) API</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>As we see with Twitter demos, the products you can make off the shelf will frankly be pretty good.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the products built on GPT-3 will be identical to each other, and few will have a meaningful edge. We’ll dive more into this next.</p><h3><strong>Differentiated Technology</strong></h3><p><strong>To win a market with technology, your product needs to be <em>obviously</em> better to the user.</strong> When Google first came out, it delivered such better search results than other engines—possibly by a subjective factor of 10 or more—that there was little reason to use any competitor. When Dropbox first came out, its syncing and ease of use was unbeatable. Right now SpaceX has a rocket that can do what no other company’s can, at an unbeatable price. These companies have real technology moats.</p><p>In contrast, if an industry has products that are are more or less identical—like online mattresses—the grounds of competition shift elsewhere other than product (like marketing and distribution), and there is no technology moat.</p><p>So imagine: If 100 companies build an AI therapy bot with GPT-3, how different will their user experiences be? How far ahead will company #1 be above company #2, and then over company #10? <strong>Will there be a 10x difference? Or more like a 5% difference?</strong></p><p>I argue: <strong>The better GPT-3 works out of the box, the harder it will be for any single company to build meaningful differentiation.</strong> Frankly, <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">early demos already look very good</a>.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I thought you made a good point so I did another run being as depressive as I could. I sampled most “John” lines only once, I think I ran one twice. I’m really impressed</p><p>The prefix makes a difference but that could be automatically prepended by an end-user therapy app <a href="https://t.co/YZmQL9EXqW" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/YZmQL9EXqW</a></p></div>— Nick Cammarata (@nicklovescode) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Imagine how much better it can get with just a <em>little</em> more work—a modicum of fine tuning on therapy conversations and user safeguards. This is the new baseline, the “table stakes” for any new entrant, which is going to be relatively easy to achieve.</p><p>And then from this baseline, how much better could any one company get?</p><p>Here’s one way to think about it. The pinnacle of AI therapy would be a bot that rivals the <em>best</em> human therapist. Call this the 100% experience. The <em>average</em> human therapist might be somewhere at the 85% bar. And then a human user might be willing to tolerate a “good enough” AI performing at 70%—it’s clearly worse than a human therapist, but usable enough that it can keep up a coherent conversation and remembers that you were bullied in 5th grade.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/d-9mr1Bo8EgQaIlWnKd4EQuSrjjJuoBmjOkpcbPwJ0h9xnyIGz832tT133eTopDQZQWr2pXAJ-lS9mhaP9KBInUCnGtSqJKAtdZV-acn55hQ25c-p7bwdHgjyl-zFJ54I9Hg4aVX" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Before GPT-3, building anything </strong><strong><em>close</em></strong><strong> to the Good Enough AI was really hard.</strong> A company would have needed to invest many millions into its own algorithms and data cleanup to get anywhere close to the human user bar.&nbsp;</p><p>In this environment, the leading company had a few advantages:</p><ul><li>The barrier to entry was high, so it faced less competition.</li><li>The spread between the #1 and #3 companies was high, meaning the leading company had a sizable moat.</li><li>It still had a lot of room to grow to get to 85%+ level—this is room in which it could carve out a meaningful edge over competition.</li><li>It owned its own technology, so it could iterate to continuously improve its experience.</li></ul><p>Here’s how the landscape might have looked:</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fz675xiZWljHeS4HWUGNcrO8qbaLtjJ9zfqJNCa2HhthN84Nt7JCQpMMhC4SzO9dWfSkGpWxOwIkaz745S-XJijAd91g0JDS2A7nDXrv6ku2fckVbW5kCl-UEyZci3tRgrb4aNwl" alt=""></figure><p>(In practice, I don’t know of any <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/chatbots-reviews#7" target="_blank">pre-GPT-3 AI therapy bot</a> that comes anywhere close to a human therapist. So competitive lead notwithstanding, I don’t think there have been any good AI therapy businesses to date.)</p><p>Then comes GPT-3. <strong>Now <em>anyone</em> can produce a “good enough AI therapy bot,”</strong> with a modicum of fine-tuning and UX design. This outcome wouldn’t be shocking—people were producing <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">plausible demos</a> within days of accessing the private beta. Imagine what can be done with just a few weeks of work and $500,000 of investment.</p><p>The result: the range of competition narrows:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BiYRcsL4EKmlGKyc5gFDCCkQ_79ijr-jBknzfVb2MVuPj-Rp-D56fLeNhVnV9F46I3tWmUgzJLfV_hh5Q-oOZuR531DWJwI11JKQWgRfFt0fDDDGybrQX7yuTvAGp0TDWmem8_K5" alt=""></figure><p>Compared to the previous situation:</p><ul><li>There are many more competitors who can offer a “good enough” product.</li><li>The range of competition is compressed into a narrower band. It becomes much harder for any single product to stand out from the median product, which is already quite good.</li><li>Because the companies don’t own the core technology behind GPT-3, their ability to improve beyond the baseline performance is limited. Yes, they can fine-tune GPT-3 with their proprietary data, but how much is this going to improve on the core algorithm, which <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/openai-launches-an-api-to-commercialize-its-research/" target="_blank">cost $12 million to train</a> on 40GB of Internet text? <strong>And won’t everyone else be fine-tuning like this too?</strong></li></ul><p>Again, this really gives credit to OpenAI for how well GPT-3 works—out of the gate, you can produce a pretty usable product. But for startups, this merely <em>raises the table stakes</em> instead of offering a competitive advantage, and it <strong>neutralizes the technology edge</strong> any single company can have over another. Great for OpenAI, not great for new startups.</p><p><strong>Then imagine how much worse this will get when GPT-4 comes out.

<p>As one of the hottest, if not <em>the</em> hottest code paths on the system, it has good reason for being so optimized: even the most minimal savings here translate directly to measurable performance increases across all Objective-C applications. But even as fast as this implementation is, sometimes it’s just not good enough: Objective-C is a dynamic language, and its features come with a price even if you’re not using them. The majority of the code executed in a typical <code>objc_msgSend</code> call is not for implementation lookup: rather, it’s checks to see if execution can proceed on the fast path. But the checks are comparatively cheap: an even bigger issue is that the function largely serves as an optimization barrier to the compiler, to which it looks like nothing more than an impenetrable trampoline to an unknown target. As such, even the simplest member access cannot be inlined; every method call <em>must</em> clobber multiple registers and almost always requires a move out of the accumulator, where it is usually undesirable to leave the result.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/d4e1ba3fa9dfec2613bdcc7db0b58dea490c56b1"><code>__attribute__((objc_direct))</code></a> (and the closely related <code>__attribute__((objc_direct_members))</code>) attempts to solve some of these problems by converting the method call into what’s essentially C-style static dispatch. The change was met with some controversy when it was introduced: calls would no longer go through the runtime machinery, breaking many features of Objective-C, including swizzling, KVO, and even subclassing. Luckily, there’s another way to get performance benefits without losing some of Objective-C’s best features.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-bit-of-idle-speculation">A little bit of idle speculation</h2>

<p>The key insight is that we can guess where the vast majority of method calls will go, and we can do so <em>at compile time</em> just by looking at the type of the receiver and message we’re sending to it. Most of the time, <code>objc_msgSend</code> is just confirming what we already know: the only practical difference between its fast path and a direct function call is that it needs to check, as quickly as possible, that its target is what it expects it to be before jumping there. There’s no way around this if we want to support Objective-C’s dynamism; any implementation we come up with will have to do this too. The advantage we have over <code>objc_msgSend</code> is that as humans (or as a compiler), we have static type information and an understanding of the surrounding code which lets us guess, statically and with high accuracy, what the target is. In fact, we can just <em>speculate</em> that the call will go to the predicted method, and, taking a leaf out of <code>objc_msgSend</code>’s book, wrap a direct call to it in the barest minimum of checking to make sure that we were correct in our prediction. In psuedocode, we can convert a call to <code>-[Foo bar]</code> (where the reciever is <code>foo</code>) to something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (target is -[Foo bar]) {
	jump to -[Foo bar]
} else {
	objc_msgSend(foo, @selector(bar))
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we’re correct, not only does this skip the cache lookup that <code>objc_msgSend</code> performs, but it also makes a <em>direct</em> call to the method: one which the compiler knows about and can optimize around.</p>

<h2 id="jumping-to-an-implementation">Jumping to an implementation</h2>

<p>We’re almost done: the only question that’s left is what goes in the “target is <code>-[Foo bar]</code>” condition. As far as I can tell, if we have a <code>Foo *foo</code> and send <code>@selector(bar)</code> to it, the only cases where execution will not directly proceed to <code>-[Foo bar]</code> are if</p>

<ol>
  <li>the reciever is <code>nil</code>,</li>
  <li>the reciever is a subclass of <code>Foo</code>, or</li>
  <li><code>-[Foo bar]</code> has been swizzled.</li>
</ol>

<p>Checking for the first can be done easily; the second is a bit more complicated. In theory we’re asking <code>[foo isMemberOfClass:Foo.class]</code>, but for obvious reasons we don’t really want the overhead that comes with this. We can skip even a call to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418629-object_getclass?language=objc"><code>object_getClass</code></a> by directly ripping the <code>isa</code> out of <code>foo</code> and comparing it against runtime metadata. There are some subtleties with <a href="http://www.sealiesoftware.com/blog/archive/2013/09/24/objc_explain_Non-pointer_isa.html">non-pointer <code>isa</code>s</a> and <a href="https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2012-07-27-lets-build-tagged-pointers.html">tagged pointers</a> but we can avoid them entirely by masking the <code>isa</code> appropriately and sending nonstandard cases to the slow path if we encounter them.</p>

<p>The last case, where the method has been swizzled, can’t be determined by the information available to <code>objc_msgSend</code> alone: instead, we need to keep around a side table of boolean values that we must check on each call. When a method is swizzled the runtime (or your code interposed in front of the runtime) must update the corresponding entry so subsequent calls will go through the runtime.</p>



<p>With all the checks in place, we can now call the method directly. To try this out, <a href="https://github.com/saagarjha/expresscall">I patched Clang</a> so that it would emit LLVM IR that performed the operations described above whenever it would have emitted a simple message send. I’ve never touched the LLVM project before, so my implementation is clumsy and probably incorrect; however, it works fine for the simple programs I tested it with and you can try it out yourself if compiling LLVM is your thing. Since I needed a name for the repository that wasn’t just “llvm-project”, I am henceforth naming this technique “expresscall”–as in “making an expresscall”. “swiftcall” would have been shorter, but with significantly more potential to be confusing.</p>



<h2 id="are-we-fast-yet">Are we fast yet?</h2>

<p>There’s no better way to see how fast (or slow) an optimization is than a highly synthetic benchmark. This one creates a simple Objective-C array type for integers, fills it with random numbers, and sums them. Since I’m a horrible person, you get to scroll past it:</p>

                    <p>(Cover Image: <a href="https://www.garrettworld.co.uk/">Scott Garrett</a>)</p><p>In early March 2020, the World Health Organisation emailed a journalist to say ‘We did NOT say that cash was transmitting coronavirus’. This <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/who-we-did-not-say-that-cash-was-transmitting-coronavirus-2020-03-06">angry rebuttal</a> came after the British Telegraph newspaper misrepresented them as being anti-cash. Days later the head of Germany's Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-germany-banknotes/banknotes-carry-no-particular-coronavirus-risk-german-disease-expert-idUSKBN20Y2ZT">(Virus) transmission through banknotes has no particular significance</a>”. He was followed by the German central bank, who put out a release saying ‘<a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/en/tasks/topics/cash-poses-no-particular-risk-of-infection-for-public-828762">Cash poses no particular risk of infection for public</a>’, noting that “the probability of becoming ill from handling cash is smaller than from many other objects used in everyday life”. They were <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull03.htm">followed in April</a> by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), who noted that “Scientific evidence suggests that the probability of transmission via banknotes is low when compared with other frequently-touched objects, such as credit card terminals or PIN pads”.</p><p>Why then, am I confronted by signs like these?</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/image.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Decathlon, where I took this photo, is a large sports chain store where people frequently make purchases over the contactless card limit (buying medium value items like running shoes, tennis raquets, and so on), which means they are telling people that pressing PIN pads (used by hundreds of others) is for their ‘protection’.</p><p>They are not alone. Almost every large supermarket chain in the UK is doing this. When I’m in Morrison’s – a large UK supermarket chain – I am asked to pay by card over a loudspeaker: the unscientific consensus in all these major stores is – <em>cash is dangerous</em>. <em>More dangerous than using card terminals or pushing the buttons on the screen of our self-service checkout counters that thousands of others have used.</em></p><div><p>Perhaps the concern is not so much for customers as for staff, who might have to handle cash handed to them by hundreds of people. Let’s be real though. Their check-out staff are handling thousands of items handed to them by hundreds of people who take them off the shelves. It’s not like cash is uniquely risky for their staff in this situation.</p><p>This practice in supermarkets is extremely worrying. During the early days of strict lock-down, they were among the only institutions allowed to stay open. The entire population of the UK would scurry out of their homes to nervously enter these stores, all of which decided to start broadcasting anti-cash messages to these anxious customers, despite the fact that major institutions like the WHO and BIS rejected the claim.</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->




<!--End mc_embed_signup--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-war-on-cash">The War on Cash</h3><p>At best this anti-cash stance is well-meaning but misguided and irresponsible. At worst it's a push to force people to use digital payments for profit-seeking reasons, disguised as a concern for public health. For the last several years I have been investigating the ‘<a href="https://alteredstatesof.money/cash-and-covid/">war on cash</a>’: banks and payments companies – who run the underlying digital payments infrastructure – have a huge interest in seeing the demise of the cash system and have actively tried to nudge society away from cash, constantly telling us to ‘prepare’ for an ‘inevitable’ end of cash whilst eroding the cash infrastructure to make it harder to use, and while publishing sob-stories about the need to ‘save’ those who will be ‘left behind’ by this imagined inevitable trajectory that they engineer.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZ4tfrr1Z8M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>I made a YouTube video on this topic as well</figcaption></figure><p>While the banking sector and fintech industry clearly have a commercial agenda in demonising cash, many chain stores do too. Over the years they have tried to automate as much as possible. They invest in self-service checkout systems as a way to automate away their staff, and digital payments is how you automate the money section of a transaction. Big tech firms like Amazon have made no secret out of how they hate non-automated offline payment - they tried to <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/amazon-go-cashless-store-philadelphia-lobbying-20190226.html">stop pro-cash laws in US cities</a> that would require shops to accept cash - but big supermarkets also prefer to deal with banking giants than to handle physical cash.</p><p>Thus, when big chain stores suddenly start asking people to turn away from cash because of ‘safety’ reasons, we should be suspicious of whether they are – in fact – pushing the broader war on cash that has already been occurring for a long time. Every announcement that says ‘please use cards or contactless’ is them saying <em>‘please step into the arms of the banking sector’</em>. They are thus acting as huge funnels pushing people into deeper dependence on an unstable and often predatory banking system, using a marginal unproven risk as their justification, and whilst neglecting to mention all the risks that come with destroying the cash system.</p><h3 id="overkilling-cash"><br>Overkilling cash</h3><p>Consider this metaphor. When walking down a city street it is possible that a branch can fall off a beautiful oak tree and kill you, but imagine if – in response to such a death – the city authorities ordered all trees to be cut down. It may be true that they have dealt with the marginal risk of trees killing people in future, but only at the expense of severely harming the overall mental health of millions of city inhabitants (as well as destroying a source of pollution absorption).</p><p>There's a very similar thing happening right now with this cash system. Fine, cash might pose a small risk of carrying infection, along with many other things (like the cooking oil I pick up off the shelf), but the risks that come with destroying the cash system are as high, if not much higher. </p><p>The anti-cash brigade don't mention all the dangerous forms of authoritarian surveillance that accompany the end of cash. They don't mention the extreme exclusion risks, or the fact that the financial system becomes far less resilient to disasters and crises if the cash system is undermined. They do not mention that pushing people away from cash increases the concentration of power in the banking sector, which but 10 years ago was being vilified as a major source of economic crises (which <em>causes </em>destitution). </p><p>It is not ‘responsible’ to promote the end of cash, and it is not responsible to promote digital payment as if it came with no risks itself (the <a href="https://www.ft.com/video/37cb70e6-72df-471e-943d-2d32c2785650">Wirecard scandal</a> should alert us to the fact that these digital payments companies are no angels). It is outrageous that the banking sector is being promoted as something that will save us from coronavirus, and it's even more outrageous that the big retailers are pushing the banks' monetary competitor - cash - ever closer to the point of demise on the basis of fake news.</p><h3 id="the-shock-doctrine-of-automation">The Shock doctrine of Automation</h3><p>The only parties that unambiguously gain from the demise of cash are the banking sector and payments companies like Visa and Mastercard. This is why we must draw on Naomi Klein’s concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine">‘shock doctrine’ and 'disaster capitalism'</a> to explain this: when we are in situations of crises we are open to being pushed into increased dependence on powerful actors who will use the heightened social anxiety to present themselves as saviours and push forward new policies and products that will extend and entrench their dominance. Think about that next time a supermarket tells you to not use cash. They present themselves as being concerned for us, but it's extremely irresponsible for them to ask us to become increasingly dependent on a banking sector that hasn't ever shown us that has our best interests at heart. Using cash in this scenario is an act of defiance.</p><h2 id="want-to-comment-on-this-article">Want to comment on this article?</h2><p>I'd love to have a comments section, but it currently takes too much work to stop spammers from posting dodgy links in the comments.

    <p><em>In my daily work, I have the good fortune to work with many very talented
people. Some are professional software developers, like myself. Others are for
example researchers, scientist, project leaders, and so on. Is that you? Do you
also write software, but not as your main activity? Do you have some experience
but maybe no formal training? In <a href="https://unfolded.dev/pages/software-development-easy-to-learn-hard-to-master/">this series of blog
posts</a> I will explain
the best practices that I use, so that you may be able to benefit from them. So
that writing software hopefully takes you less effort and gives you more
pleasure.</em></p><h2 id="a-creative-pursuit">A Creative Pursuit</h2><p>A decade or so ago, I had the good fortune to work with a group of extremely
smart scientists. Without going into details, their job was to conceive
algorithms for image processing, and improve them. They had huge volumes of
data, and the ability to create more. The algorithms had to be robust in the
face of all kinds of variations in that data. Much like software development,
their work was <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">a creative pursuit</a>.</p><p>They would have regular meetings to discuss progress, results and challenges. In
those meetings, I remember being surprised now and then. For example, you might
hear a conversation like this<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Betty</strong>: Say, John, didn't you have some progress on «some algorithm
feature» a few weeks ago? I'm running into some issues and I think your
findings may help me here.</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Yeah, that's right, I remember having some results when I was
working on «something else». I'm not sure which algorithm variant
I used exactly though, or which test data for that matter. If it's important
to you, we can sit together and see if we can reproduce that.</p></blockquote><p>While this was commendable in terms of team spirit, I always felt it wasteful
that apparently things had not been tracked and documented in such a way that it
was easy to recover what people had tried and done.</p><p>🤔</p><h2 id="not-a-unique-problem">Not A Unique Problem</h2><p>It turns out that software development is not that different from research in
the sense that they are both creative pursuits. Also software development
requires a good amount of trial-and-error, backtracking, rethinking, trying
again, going back to something that wasn't so stupid after all. The difference
is that we, software developers, are lazy to the point that we try to automate
just about anything that we can. So we use tools. And yes, nowadays probably
everybody understands that I'm going to say "git" (or "mercurial" or something
similar)<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. So I'm not going to explain what git is here. Plenty of
good resources out there on that topic. No, I'm going to tell you a bit about
how I use it.</p><p>🛠</p><h2 id="a-logbook-on-steroids">A Logbook On Steroids</h2><p>My version control system (e.g. git) is like a logbook. I use it to record
relevant things about my work that are not part of the code itself. For example,
in a commit message I type the reason why I'm doing things a certain way. Or I
might record that I tried something but it failed. Let's go into some details to
better explain.</p><h3 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h3><p>For any kind of writing, an important question is: who is your target audience?
Whether it's a blog post like this one, a scientific paper, a conference talk,
you always ask yourself: for whom am I writing this? For version control, the
answer is:</p><ol><li>My future self. Much like the researchers in the example above, I cannot hold
everything in my head. I forget details, I forget why I tried certain things,
I forget why other things failed. By documenting them, I can remind myself
when I need to in the near or not-so-near future.</li><li>My team. Even though I very much like pair programming, and I hope one day to
be part of a team that wants to do <a href="https://040code.github.io/2019/03/15/mob-programming">mob programming</a>, in
reality I cannot share all relevant details with the rest of my team all the
time. By documenting them, I allow my team mates to step into my shoes and
follow my reasoning.</li><li>Successors or other people who may have to work on the code when I'm not
around. Even though the average "best before" date of software is a fair
bit closer than people prefer to believe, it still happens that I write code
that others need to continue working on when I'm not available, for example
because I'm in a different department or working for a different employer.
Again, by documenting things I try to enable them to decide what pieces are
important to them and which are not.</li></ol><h3 id="tell-a-story">Tell A Story</h3><p>Well, maybe that's a bit overdoing it. My kids are going to be bored out of
their socks by these stories. But still, I do try to commit in such a way that
the sequence of all commit messages can be understood by others. They say more
than the individual commits in isolation, because the succession of commits
allows you to distill my reasoning, from where to where I'm going.</p><h3 id="record-frequently">Record Frequently</h3><p>This requires to commit frequently. "Oh but I do! I commit at least every day
before I leave the office! And sometimes even more!", you say? Well, we're
thinking of a different order of magnitude then. When I'm "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">in flow</a>" I
commit <em>many times every hour</em>. Every few minutes when I'm really on a roll. No,
of course not always. When I'm grinding on a hard problem I may have nothing to
commit for a few hours. That's ok, but it should be exceptional, not the norm.</p><p>Committing frequently also means that I make separate commits when reasonably
possible. For example, as I'm writing this blog post, I'm making a few changes
to the CSS style sheet. I could commit those as part of the blog post, or as a
separate commit. Instead, I chose to create
<a href="https://github.com/svdo/unfolded.dev/commit/3fec2de430168ad50cbdee7144b5f5f827321be4">three</a> <a href="https://github.com/svdo/unfolded.dev/commit/63c1a75a857b8c6075c9d8302535309b1857ec37">separate</a> <a href="https://github.com/svdo/unfolded.dev/commit/9fb7189a19b5d1b0f53113996d9a95259395b193">commits</a> because each
makes sense on its own, without the other two. This way I can later revert any
of the three changes by simply reverting the corresponding commit. Of course
some people find this rather extreme<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>, and that's fine. YMMV.</p><h3 id="rewrite">Rewrite</h3><p>And like any good story, this one also needs to be polished and rewritten to be
as good as it can be. I do that all the time. When I'm working on a feature, I
may for example have ten commits that form a logical whole. Then I notice
that there was a change that should have been part of one of those commits, but
I overlooked it at that time. So I make a new commit with that single thing that
I forgot, I move that new "fixup" commit to the commit where it belongs, and I
combine the two. I look at the commit messages and edit them if needed.
I reorder commits. And then, when I'm satisfied, only then I push my commits to
the remote, so that others will only see the polished version of my story.
Obviously having a great git client tremendously helps with this. I can't
recommend anything specific on Linux or Windows, but on macOS <a href="https://gitup.co/">GitUp</a> is
extraordinary in this regard: hitting "d" moves a commit down, hitting "f" does
a fixup (combine it with the commit before it), "e" edits the commit message. I
don't know of another git client that can do this so easily.</p><h3 id="record-failures">Record Failures</h3><p>One final thing to note here: don't hesitate to also record failures. Most of
the time there is more to be learned from failures than from successes. So when
rewriting my commits before pushing, I may either delete a few commits that were
failures, but sometimes I actually decide to leave them there and explain (in
the commit messages) why. Same for "reverse commit". I try something that
doesn't work but is already committed. I may then delete that last commit before
pushing, but I can also "reverse commit" it. Again, so that it may be clear that
I tried something and that it failed, so that others don't have to try
themselves as well.</p><p>📔</p><h2 id="when-to-use-it">When To Use It</h2><p>In closing, I want to say a few words about <em>when</em> I use a version control
system. The answer may surprise you, because it is: "almost always". Yesterday
and today, I was trying out a few different crypto libraries for some finite
field arithmetic that I needed to do. So I created a few small projects to
quickly try a few libraries. And for each of those, I created a git repo. Just
on my own computer, mind you. Unless I end up creating a spike that I think has
value to others, I won't create a remote for these repos. But just typing <code>git init</code> after creating a new project doesn't cost me anything. When I don't need
it anymore, I remove the project, and the embedded <code>.git</code> folder with the
history is automatically deleted as well. So why not?</p><p>Like Woody Zuill says it: "turn up the good!" If using a version control system
like git is good, turn it up. Use it more than you used to, and then more still,
and see what happens. If committing to git is good, turn it up. Commit more
frequently, and then more frequently still. Maybe you'll be surprised. I hope it
will bring you the satisfaction it has given me!</p><p>🤠</p><p>Since this is a privacy-friendly static web site, I'm not including the ability
to post comments directly here. I do love feedback though, so I created a ticket
on GitHub that you can use to leave your comments. Tell me if it's bad, tell me
if it's good, but please don't forget to tell me <em>why</em>. So please head over
there and <a href="https://github.com/svdo/unfolded.dev/issues/1">leave your comments</a>!</p>

<p>An operating system is used to make our job easier when using graphics. In our instance, in addition to everything else. In this post, we will be writing a GPU (graphics processing unit) driver using the VirtIO specification. In here, we will allow user applications to have a portion of the screen as RAM–with what is commonly known as a <em>framebuffer</em>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Contents</h2>



<ol><li><a href="#overview">Overview</a></li><li><a href="#pixels">Pixels and Resolution</a></li><li><a href="#virtio">The GPU VirtIO Device</a></li><li><a href="#init">Initialization</a></li><li><a href="#invalid">Invalidation and Transfer</a></li><li><a href="#response">Device Responses</a></li><li><a href="#user">User Space</a></li><li><a href="#api">Simple Graphics API</a></li><li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusions and Further Reading</a></li></ol>



<hr>



<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>



<p>We command the virtual GPU (virtio-gpu) by sending certain commands to the host (the device). The guest (the OS driver) has an allocation of RAM that becomes the framebuffer. The driver then tells the device, “hey, here’s the RAM that we’re going to use to store pixel information.”</p>



<p>The RAM is contiguous in our OS, but according to the specification, this isn’t strictly required. We will give the driver a rectangle. Everything that falls within that rectangle will be copied to the host. We don’t want to keep copying the entire buffer over and over again.</p>



<p>We will be using the virtio protocol that we used for the block driver here, so I won’t rehash the general virtio protocol. However, the device-specific structures are a bit different, so we’ll cover that part more in depth.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="pixels">Pixels and Resolution</h2>



<p>A framebuffer must be large enough to store \(\text{width}\times\text{height}\times\text{pixel size}\) number of bytes. There are \(\text{width}\times\text{height}\) number of pixels. Each pixel has a 1-byte red, green, blue, and alpha channels. So, each pixel is exactly 4 bytes with the configuration we’re going to specify.</p>



<p>The framebuffer for our junior GPU driver is going to support a fixed resolution of \(640\times 480\). If you’re a child of the 90s, you saw this resolution a lot. In fact, my first computer, a Laser Pal 386, had a 16-color monitor with a resolution of 640 pixels wide with 480 pixels tall.</p>

<p>There are red, green, and blue pixels so close together that by varying the intensity of these three channels, we can change the color. The closer we get to our monitors, the easier a pixel is to see.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14.png"><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14.png" alt="" width="285" height="288" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14.png 380w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14-297x300.png 297w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px"></a><figcaption>Pixels on a Viewsonic VX2770SMH-LED monitor.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You can see these little squares. If you squint enough, you can see that they aren’t pure white. Instead, you can see bits of red, blue, and green. That’s because each one of these little squares is subdivided into three colors: yep, red, green, and blue! To make white, these pixels are turned up to 11 (get the joke?). To make black, we turn off all three channels of that pixel.</p>



<p>The resolution refers to how many of these squares are on our monitor. This is a 1920×1080 monitor. That means that there are 1920 of these squares going left to right, and there are 1080 of these squares from top to bottom. All in all, we have \(1920\times 1080=2,073,600\) number of pixels. Each one of these pixels is expressed using 4 bytes in the framebuffer, meaning we need \(2,073,600\times 4=8,294,400\) bytes in RAM to store the pixel information.</p>



<p>You can see why I limited our resolution to 640×480, which only requires \(640\times 480\times 4=1,228,800\) bytes–a bit over a megabyte.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="virtio">The GPU VirtIO Device</h2>



<p>The GPU device requires us to read a more up-to-date VirtIO specification. I’ll be reading from version 1.1, which you can get a copy here: <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/virtio-v1.1.html">https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/virtio-v1.1.html</a>. Specifically, chapter 5.7 “GPU Device”. This is an <em>unaccelerated</em> 2D device, meaning that we must use the CPU to actually form the framebuffer, then we transfer our CPU formulated memory location to the host GPU, which is then responsible for drawing it to the screen.</p>



<p>The device uses a request/response system, where we the driver make a command to request something from the host (the GPU).  We add a bit of extra memory into our request so that the host can formulate its response. When the GPU interrupts us, we can take a look at this response memory location to see what the GPU told us. This is much like the <em>status</em> field on the block driver, where the block device tells us the status of our last request.</p>



<p>Each request starts with a <em>Command Header</em>, which in Rust looks as follows:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#[repr(C)]
struct CtrlHeader {
	ctrl_type: CtrlType,
	flags: u32,
	fence_id: u64,
	ctx_id: u32,
	padding: u32
}</pre>



<p>The header is common for all requests and all responses. We can differentiate by the CtrlType enumeration, which is:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#[repr(u32)]
enum CtrlType {
	/* 2d commands */
	CmdGetDisplayInfo = 0x0100,
	CmdResourceCreate2d,
	CmdResourceUref,
	CmdSetScanout,
	CmdResourceFlush,
	CmdTransferToHost2d,
	CmdResourceAttachBacking,
	CmdResourceDetachBacking,
	CmdGetCapsetInfo,
	CmdGetCapset,
	CmdGetEdid,
	/* cursor commands */
	CmdUpdateCursor = 0x0300,
	CmdMoveCursor,
	/* success responses */
	RespOkNoData = 0x1100,
	RespOkDisplayInfo,
	RespOkCapsetInfo,
	RespOkCapset,
	RespOkEdid,
	/* error responses */
	RespErrUnspec = 0x1200,
	RespErrOutOfMemory,
	RespErrInvalidScanoutId,
	RespErrInvalidResourceId,
	RespErrInvalidContextId,
	RespErrInvalidParameter,
}</pre>



<p>I took this directly from the specification, but Rust-ified the names to avoid getting yelled at by the linter.</p>



<h3>Pixel Formats</h3>



<p>Recall that the framebuffer is just a bunch of bytes in memory. We need to put a structure behind the framebuffer so the host (the GPU) knows how to interpret your sequence of bytes. There are several formats, but all-in-all, they just re-arrange the red, green, blue, and alpha channels. All are exactly 4 bytes, which makes the <em>stride</em> the same. The stride is the spacing from one pixel to another–4 bytes.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#[repr(u32)]
enum Formats {
	B8G8R8A8Unorm = 1,
	B8G8R8X8Unorm = 2,
	A8R8G8B8Unorm = 3,
	X8R8G8B8Unorm = 4,
	R8G8B8A8Unorm = 67,
	X8B8G8R8Unorm = 68,
	A8B8G8R8Unorm = 121,
	R8G8B8X8Unorm = 134,
}</pre>



<p>The type, <em>unorm</em>, is an 8-bit (1-byte) unsigned value from 0 through 255, where 0 represents no intensity and 255 represents full intensity, and a number in between is a linear-interpolation between no and full intensity. Since there are three color (and one alpha), that gives us \(256\times 256\times 256=16,776,216\) different colors or levels of colors.</p>



<p>For this tutorial, I selected <code>R8G8B8A8Unorm = 67</code>, which has red first, green second, blue third, and alpha fourth. This is a common ordering, so I’ll select it to make it easy to follow along.</p>



<p>Our selected format makes the pixel structure look as follows:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21.png"><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-1024x614.png" alt="" width="512" height="307" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-1024x614.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-300x180.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-768x461.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-1536x921.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21-2048x1228.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Recall that each individual component R, G, B, and A are each one byte a piece, so each Pixel referred to by (x, y) is 4 bytes. This is why our memory pointer is a Pixel structure instead of a byte.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="init">Initialization</h2>



<p>Just like all other virtio devices, we set up the virtqueues first and then we work on device-specific initialization. In my code, I just directly copied-and-pasted from the block driver into the gpu driver. The only thing I added to the Device structure was the framebuffer and dimensions of the framebuffer.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">pub struct Device {
	queue:        *mut Queue,
	dev:          *mut u32,
	idx:          u16,
	ack_used_idx: u16,
	framebuffer:  *mut Pixel,
	width:        u32,
	height:       u32,
}</pre>



<p>The specification tells us to do the following in order to initialize the device and get things ready to draw. I Rust-ified some of the content to match our enumerations.</p>



<h4>Create a framebuffer and configure scanout</h4>



<ol><li>Create a host resource using <code>CmdResourceCreate2d</code>.</li><li>Allocate a framebuffer from guest ram, and attach it as backing storage to the resource just created, using <code>CmdResourceAttachBacking</code>.</li><li>Use <code>CmdSetScanout</code> to link the framebuffer to a display scanout.</li></ol>



<h3>A Request Structure</h3>



<p>Recall that our request and response come packaged together. We will put them in separate descriptors, but whenever we get a response back from the device, it is going to be easier if we free just once to free both the request and response. So, in Rust, I created the Request structure to support doing this.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">struct Request&lt;RqT, RpT&gt; {
	request: RqT,
	response: RpT,
}
impl&lt;RqT, RpT&gt; Request&lt;RqT, RpT&gt; {
	pub fn new(request: RqT) -&gt; *mut Self {
		let sz = size_of::&lt;RqT&gt;() + size_of::&lt;RpT&gt;();
		let ptr = kmalloc(sz) as *mut Self;
		unsafe {
			(*ptr).request = request;
		}
		ptr
	}
}</pre>



<h4>Step 1: Create host resource</h4>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">let rq = Request::new(ResourceCreate2d {
	hdr: CtrlHeader {
		ctrl_type: CtrlType::CmdResourceCreate2d,
		flags: 0,
		fence_id: 0,
		ctx_id: 0,
		padding: 0,
	},
	resource_id: 1,
	format: Formats::R8G8B8A8Unorm,
	width: dev.width,
	height: dev.height,
});
let desc_c2d = Descriptor {
	addr: unsafe { &amp;(*rq).request as *const ResourceCreate2d as u64 },
	len: size_of::&lt;ResourceCreate2d&gt;() as u32,
	flags: VIRTIO_DESC_F_NEXT,
	next: (dev.idx + 1) % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE as u16,
};
let desc_c2d_resp = Descriptor {
	addr: unsafe { &amp;(*rq).response as *const CtrlHeader as u64 },
	len: size_of::&lt;CtrlHeader&gt;() as u32,
	flags: VIRTIO_DESC_F_WRITE,
	next: 0,
};
unsafe {
	let head = dev.idx;
	(*dev.queue).desc[dev.idx as usize] = desc_c2d;
	dev.idx = (dev.idx + 1) % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE as u16;
	(*dev.queue).desc[dev.idx as usize] = desc_c2d_resp;
	dev.idx = (dev.idx + 1) % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE as u16;
	(*dev.queue).avail.ring[(*dev.queue).avail.idx as usize % VIRTIO_RING_SIZE] = head;
	(*dev.queue).avail.idx = (*dev.queue).avail.idx.wrapping_add(1);
}</pre>



<p>All we’re really telling the GPU here is our resolution and the format of the framebuffer. When we create this, the host gets to configure itself, such as allocating an identical buffer to make transfers from our OS.</p>



<h4>Step 2: Attach framebuffer backing.</h4>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">let rq = Request3::new(AttachBacking {
	hdr: CtrlHeader {
		ctrl_type: CtrlType::CmdResourceAttachBacking,
		flags: 0,
		fence_id: 0,
		ctx_id: 0,
		padding: 0,
	},
	resource_id: 1,
	nr_entries: 1,
},
MemEntry {
	addr: dev.framebuffer as u64,
	length: dev.width * dev.height * size_of::&lt;Pixel&gt;() as u32,
	…</pre></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/">Cattle, Not Pets</a> analogy has been espousing the disposability of servers notion since the early days of the cloud revolution. Treat your infrastructure as cattle: design for failure, automate deployment, and when things go wrong with a server, take it out in the back, shoot it, and replace it with another one on the line. Contrastingly, servers treated like pets seek painstaking care: they are manually built, irreplaceable and often christened with cute names.</p>

<p><img src="https://akshayeshenoi.github.io/assets/2020-05-25-modern-approach-dev-infra/pet-cattle.jpg" alt="cattle-pets"></p>

<p>The cattle approach, that Google in fact pioneered, has been bearing fruits of scalability and manageability of application infrastructure for teams across the board. Engineers today are armed with an arsenal of tools that allow them to weave together compute, network and storage infrastructure in an abstract (albeit opinionated) fashion. As a corollary, teams don’t concern themselves with the gory details of where their code is running, but can indeed turn their focus to what they do best - write application code!</p>

<p>Developer infrastructure, however, hasn’t fundamentally changed since we shifted from developing on giant room-sized mainframes to developing on compact personal machines. Sure, our laptops pack a considerably meaner punch than they did decades ago, but the innovation has largely been incremental. Embarrassingly, we continue to struggle with the same age old problems such as the abhorrent “but it works on my machine” phenomenon that pervades even the best of teams. On-boarding new members still comes with the unnecessary friction of manually setting up environments. Version conflicts are not infrequent.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the future looks grim; a fundamental shift in the way we do things is indeed underway. The explosion of Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes has opened up new doors and container technology has been progressively making deep in-roads into every facet of the development life-cycle.</p>

<h4 id="state-of-the-art">State of the Art</h4>

<p>Today, engineers are equipped with environments that are identical to the ones that run on production servers. On their local machine, a developer typically spawns an instance of a custom-built image downloaded from a remote repository. This image (which is the environment) is configured with just the right amount - and the right versions - of dependencies required to compile and run the application code. When the CI eventually takes the code to production, a similar image retaining only the runtime dependencies is spawned to execute it. Since everyone works on a unified environment, most of the conventional problems are mitigated.</p>

<p>This is great - but why stop at that?</p>

<h4 id="the-modern-approach">The Modern Approach</h4>

<p>If teams have embraced this unified approach to developer environments, why not go one step further and provision them on shared infrastructure to benefit from economies of scale? The power of the cloud at the developer’s fingertips! Environments can be spawned at will, utilized, and discarded when the developer logs off. (Of course, persisting state somehow).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Treat the modern developer infrastructure as cattle, not pets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notably, our existing developer tooling would have to be minimally disrupted for this transition. We spend most of our time on our beloved editors - every extension, theme and font tuned to perfection. Departing from our sanctum sanctorum would be desecration. Our cattle would at least need to provide the <em>illusion</em> of being a pet.</p>

<p>Microsoft demonstrated a somewhat bare-bones version of this capability with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/05/02/remote-development">Remote Development</a> on VS Code (Remote - Containers). Essentially, a component of VSCode runs inside a docker container as a server, and the UI component connects to it from the host machine. The terminal processes, extensions and debuggers run <em>inside</em> the container - which could be hosted anywhere on the network - while the UI is rendered on the developer’s machine.</p>

<p>Such a technology could form the bedrock of more complex systems that realize the notion of disposable environments. Picture a fully managed developer infrastructure platform that provides teams with the capability of curating and deploying environments in the cloud!</p>

<p><img src="https://akshayeshenoi.github.io/assets/2020-05-25-modern-approach-dev-infra/diagram.png" alt="modern-dev-infra"></p>

<p>In fact, GitHub announced <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces/">CodeSpaces</a>: a feature so magical and game changing, it’s hard to underscore its true potential. At the click of a button, a developer can spin-up instant dev environments with all the dependencies the repository needs <strong>and work entirely on the cloud</strong>. Not only does it provide a VSCode like experience <em>in the browser</em>, but one can connect to it from a full installation of VSCode as well!</p>

<p>While GitHub has the advantage of being <em>the</em> destination for source code, making it an easy choice for a number of teams, other solutions may offer more advanced features. For instance, <a href="https://www.koding.com/">Koding</a> takes a less opinionated approach and allows configuration of powerful dev-environments on any cloud provider. This could be suitable for teams seeking finer-grained customization.</p>

<p>Indeed, these advances paint a promising future. Fiscally speaking, the economies of scale realized as we move towards environments on shared infrastructure will bring down costs. For startups and smaller enterprises with “Bring Your Own Device” policies, unified virtual environments would break down most compatibility related barriers. Further, global availability of these environments would also benefit teams distributed across continents.</p>

<p>In an ironic way, this is a modern revival of the mainframe way of doing things.</p>

July 31, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/sqlmancer-graphql-to-sql/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/sqlmancer-graphql-to-sql/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since its open-sourcing, GraphQL keeps on gaining popularity and is becoming used by more &amp; more development teams. Why? What’s its secret? It’s simple, GraphQL makes describing the complex data dependencies easy and it can be usee with any programming language. The rising popularity created a demand for different tools and libraries facilitating GraphQL implementation &amp; usage across different technologies and vice-versa. <strong>Sqlmancer</strong> is one of them.</p>
<h2>Goals &amp; Features</h2>
<p>Sqlmancer is a Node.js library simplifying GraphQL integration with SQL by translating GraphQL queries into SQL statements in a smart way. The flexibility offered by Sqlmancer allows you to create the queries and mutations that suit your schema as well as leaving the decisions to you what types you want to expose in your schema by offering a number of convenient directives. The last but not least, Sqlmancer put annotation over transformation using directives mostly to annotate your schema rather than changing its behavior, aiming to be as aspect-oriented as possible.</p>
<p>Some of the notable features of Sqlmancer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Various dialects supported</strong> - you can incorporate Sqlmancer into existing projects regardless of what flavor of SQL you’re using as it supports Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced sorting &amp; filtering</strong> - Add complex sorting and filtering to your data-fetching, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>filtering using logical operators,</li>
<li>filtering and sorting by fields</li>
<li>filtering by aggregate fields of related models.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> - Sqlmancer makes the N+1 problem the song of the past by building a single SQL query to fetch all necessary data, regardless of query depth.</li>
<li><strong>Custom scalars &amp; Abstract types</strong> - Use the scalars that make sense and easily add unions and interfaces into your schema using views or single table inheritance features.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Sqlmancer generates a type-safe database client basing on your GraphQL schema and metadata provided through a set of schema directives, giving you the ability to query your server for complex data structures with a single SQL query:</p>

<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Here's the final result. Requests made through Cloudflare are accepted and served as expected because Cloudflare will provide a valid <code>X-CF-KEY</code> header to our web application. Requests that are made directly to the web application will fail because the header is not present.</p><h2 id="-success"><p>âœ… Success!<a aria-label="anchor" href="#-success">#</a></p></h2><p>Through the use of Cloudflare Workers we can guarantee that the request originates from your Cloudflare account which can be used as a mechanism to prevent bypassing of your Cloudflare configuration. This is a valid solution in case you cannot leverage Argo Tunnels in your environment.</p><p>If possible you should configure Cloudflare account to use Full (strict) SSL/TLS encryption and Authenticated Origin Pulls for improved security and to prevent MITM attacks.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Firebase being a BaaS solution comes with a bunch of features for developers to build their app faster and with real-time capabilities. But, there is one thing that is yet to be addressed by Firebase’s feature set - the ability to perform full-text search on the data that is stored in Firebase databases (like Firestore or Realtime Database). This creates a huge bottleneck for developers since search is one of the primary user experiences for any application we build.</p><p>Thankfully we’ve got Algolia that can help us solve this problem. This is a service which helps you store the index of data from firebase, making it searchable. The important advantage of Algolia is that it’s supported in different platforms with a lot of UI components, which can be easily used to develop search modules for your apps.</p><p>In this article, I’ll walk you through how to set up your Algolia and index your data when new data is created or modified in your Firebase Firestore. This article is split into the following sections, you can skip any, in case if you’re already aware of them.</p><ol><li>Creating an account in Algolia</li><li>Setting up Firebase Cloud Function</li><li>Index data from Firebase Firestore on create and edit.</li></ol><h3 id="creating-an-account-in-algolia">Creating an account in Algolia<a href="#creating-an-account-in-algolia">#</a></h3><p>As the first step, you can navigate to Algolia and register your account by either signing up with Google or Github or just with email.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image6-9.png"><img src="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image6-9.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Once you’ve created your Algolia account, go to the dashboard and find a default project created under your account. Let’s use that project for this article.</p><p>Similar to Firestore collections Algolia has an “Index” - the aggregation of data under a common umbrella. Create your index to store the data.</p><p>In this case, I have created an index called “Recipes” to save food recipes</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image1-30.png"><img src="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image1-30.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>After creating an account, add data to the index. Among the 3 different options for adding the data, we’ll be using the API for importing data with help from the firebase cloud functions.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image4-22.png"><img src="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image4-22.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><h3 id="setting-up-firebase-cloud-functions">Setting up Firebase Cloud Functions<a href="#setting-up-firebase-cloud-functions">#</a></h3><p>Let’s assume that you’re already having a firebase project and upgraded to <strong>Blaze Plan</strong> since we have to call external APIs from functions. Then, initialize the functions in your project with the Firebase CLI tool and setup cloud functions.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">cd ProjectFolder
firebase init 
</code></pre></div><p>On completion, you’ll find a folder named “<strong>functions</strong>” in your project folder. Open the project folder in a text editor like VSCode.</p><p>Now we’re going to index data in the “recipes” collection to our new Algolia index. So, let’s create two functions that listen to onCreate and onEdit of any document in the “recipes” collection.</p><p>functions/index.js</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>functions</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>'firebase-functions'</span>);
<span>const</span> <span>onCreate</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>'./triggers/recipes/onCreate'</span>);

                                   .<span>onUpdate</span>(<span>onEdit</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Create the handler functions for onCreate of recipe docs and onEdit of the same. So, I’ve created two files under the triggers folder of our functions</p><p><em>functions/triggers/recipes/onCreate.js</em></p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>module</span>.<span>exports</span> <span>=</span> (<span>snap</span>, <span>context</span>) =&gt; {

</code></pre></div><p>After updating the config, we can start using it in the ‘functions’ code. In order to use Algolia, we need to install the npm package in our functions code base.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">cd functions
npm install --save algoliasearch
</code></pre></div><p>After installing the package, create a config file to setup Algolia with the API Keys</p><p><em>functions/config/algolia.js</em></p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>functions</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>'firebase-functions'</span>);
<span>const</span> <span>algoliasearch</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>'algoliasearch'</span>);

<span>module</span>.<span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>algoliasearch</span>(<span>ALGOLIA_ID</span>, <span>ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>This file exports the Algolia Client which we can use to index data and delete the indexed data. Thus, we need to import this in our onCreate and onEdit file.</p><p>With the client, you can initialize the index, in our case “Recipes” and we use <code>saveObject</code> function to store the data inside the index.</p><p><em>functions/triggers/recipes/onCreate.js</em></p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>"../../config/algolia"</span>);

<span>module</span>.<span>exports</span> <span>=</span> (<span>snap</span>, <span>context</span>) =&gt; {
 <span>let</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>snap</span>.<span>data</span>();
 <span>data</span>.<span>objectID</span> <span>=</span> <span>snap</span>.<span>id</span>;
 <span>recipeIndex</span>.<span>saveObject</span>(<span>data</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><p><em>functions/triggers/recipes/onEdit.js</em></p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>"../../config/algolia"</span>);

 <span>recipeIndex</span>.<span>saveObject</span>(<span>data</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><p>In the above two files, we’ve extracted the data from the snap (in onCreate) and changed (in onEdit) to a variable called data. In Algolia, the primary key is stored in the attribute <code>objectID</code> of data, so we’re storing the firebase document ID as the objectID.</p><p>Let’s deploy the function and test the setup. Deploy the firebase functions by executing the below command from the project’s root folder.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">firebase deploy --only functions
</code></pre></div><p>After deploying, create a document under the **recipes **collection and see if it’s indexed in Algolia.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image2-31.png"><img src="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image2-31.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>As soon as you create the data in Firestore, the cloud functions will be triggered and the indexes will be created in your Algolia project.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image3-21.png"><img src="https://www.skcript.com/svrmedia/heroes/image3-21.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Similarly, the index will be updated every time you edit the data in Firestore. This happens realtime and thus your search will be always updated.</p><p>Thus, you can replicate the data from firebase to Algolia to create a full-text search index. Hope this article helped you to get started with Algolia setup for your firebase project.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Nowadays, transfer learning from pretrained models on Imagenet is the ultimate standard in computer vision. Self-supervised learning dominates natural language processing, but this doesn’t mean that there are no significant use-cases for computer vision that it should be considered. There are indeed a lot of cool self-supervised tasks that one can devise when she/he is dealing with images, such as jigsaw puzzles [6], image colorization, image inpainting, or even unsupervised <a href="https://theaisummer.com/gan-computer-vision-style-gan/#self-supervised-gans-via-auxiliary-rotation-loss-2018" target="_blank">image synthesis</a>.</p>

<p>But what happens when the time dimension comes into play? How can you approach the video-based tasks that you would like to solve?</p>

<p>So, let’s start from the beginning, one concept at a time. What is self-supervised learning? And how is it different from transfer learning? What is a pretext task?</p>

<h2 id="self-supervised-learning-vs-transfer-learning">Self-supervised learning VS transfer learning</h2>

<p>Transfer learning is a fair point to start.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Transfer learning enables us to exploit the weights of a (convolutional) neural network used for task A and apply it to another task (B), given that the input domains are somehow related.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The training process in task A is called <strong>pretraining</strong> in machine learning terminology. The core idea behind this is that the acquired ‘knowledge’ of task A may be exploited to enhance generalization in task B. And this is usually the case, because who wants to start from a random weight initialization?</p>

<p>Obviously, transfer learning is one way to maximize the performance of your model, by <strong>pretraining</strong> on a similar <strong>supervised</strong> (video) dataset. However, in domains such as videos the problem of annotation (supervision) quickly arises. It is difficult to find video annotated data and transfer weights.</p>

<p>But even before that, let’s clarify the inherent differences of <strong>self-supervised learning VS transfer learning</strong>. I created this simple diagram to make things crystal clear:</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/self-supervised-learning-videos/self-supervized-VS-transfer-learning.png" alt="self-supervized-VS-transfer-learning">
<em>Self-supervized VS transfer-learning</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a solution to supervision-deprived domains, self-supervised learning is one way to transfer weights, by pretraining your model on labels that are artificially produced <strong>from</strong> the data/videos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can be achieved with a bunch of different (and sometimes tricking) transformations, as we will see. This is exactly what we call self-supervised representation learning.</p>

<p>Note that, for self supervised learning, <strong>you can even use just your own data, but without the provided labels</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In essence, in self-supervised learning we are trying to <strong>guess</strong> a related task A so the weight transfer to task B, would be a better initialization point than random.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="notations-concepts-and-example-tasks">Notations, concepts and example tasks</h2>

<p>The devised self-supervised task A is usually called <strong>pretext</strong> or <strong>proxy</strong> task, while the desired task B we want to solve is referred in the literature as a <strong>downstream task</strong>. I usually refer to it as original task also.</p>

<p>Back in the world of videos, video-based learning fall into the category of sequential learning. These approaches can be broadly divided into two classes: sequence <strong>prediction</strong> and <strong>verification</strong>. Additionally, (image) <strong>tuples</strong> refer to a bunch of frames of a video that will be used as the input to the deep learning architecture. <strong>Siamese</strong> models or <strong>multi-branch</strong> models are used interchangeably in the different papers. It is basically <strong>independent predictions of multiple input data</strong>. You can simply think that a lot of forward passes of the siamese model have to be performed before a backward pass, while the extracted features are fused in the next layers. As a result, the loss that will be backpropagated taken into account all the forward passes.</p>

<p>Now we have a clear high-level concept of self-supervision. Let’s see why it is important, especially on video datasets!</p>

<h2 id="why-self-supervised-learning">Why Self-Supervised learning?</h2>

<p>First of all, you <strong>cannot create a new video-dataset</strong> (or any kind of dataset) <strong>for each particular task</strong>. Video annotations are also expensive and time-consuming. Secondly, in a domain such as <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-coordinates/" target="_blank">medical imaging</a>, <strong>it is hard to obtain any expert annotation at all</strong>. On the other hand, hundreds of thousands of hours of unlabeled videos are uploaded daily on youtube! If you are still not convinced that self-supervised learning is an awesome direction, let’s advise the experts:</p>

<p>“<em>Most of what we learn as humans and most of what animals learn is in a <strong>self-supervised mode</strong>, not a reinforcement mode. It’s basically observing the world and interacting with it a little bit, mostly by observation in a test-independent way.</em>” ~  Yann LeCun, Director of Facebook AI Research (FAIR)</p>

<p>Now I believe that you are convinced. However, be aware that every exciting idea comes with its assumptions and counterparts. But before that let’s clarify our terminology first.</p>

<p>Moving on, what is the <strong>core assumption</strong> of self-supervised learning on videos?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intuitively, we argue that successfully solving the “pretext” task A will <strong>allow our model to learn useful visual representation to recover the temporal coherence of a video</strong>, or in general learning from the statistical temporal structure of videos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One example of temporal consistency might be <strong>observing how objects</strong> (cars, humans) <strong>move in the scene</strong>.</p>

<p>Some of the questions that may come in your mind, as perfectly described by Misra et al. [1]:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>“How does the model learn from the spatiotemporal structure present in the video <strong>without using supervised semantic labels</strong>?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Are the representations learned using the unsupervised/self-supervised spatiotemporal information present in videos <strong>meaningful</strong>?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“And finally, are these representations <strong>complementary</strong> to those learned from strongly supervised image data?”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We will answer these questions by inspecting different approaches.</p>

<p>But even before that, <strong>how does one design a self-supervised task</strong>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short, a good self-supervised task is neither simple nor ambiguous [6].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another critical factor that we take into account is <strong>if humans can solve the pretext task</strong>. As an example, try to understand the sequence of the frames below. With a little bit of focus on the relative poses and speculations about “how a person moves”, we can predict the chronological order of these frames.</p>

<em>Taken from the original work [2]</em></p>

<p>Moreover, we need to choose something that <strong>if solved, would require an understanding of our data</strong>. That’s why it falls into the category of representation learning anyway :) .</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insight: the key idea is to leverage the inherent structure of raw images and <strong>formulate</strong> the problem as discriminative (classification) or introduce a reconstruction loss function to train the network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, I hope you are ready to briefly examine the most influential papers for self-supervised representation learning on videos.</p>

<h2 id="1-shuffle-and-learn-unsupervised-learning-using-temporal-order-verification-eccv-2016">1. Shuffle and Learn: Unsupervised Learning using Temporal Order Verification, ECCV 2016</h2>

<p>This is one of the first works introduced by Misra et al. [1]. They formulate their pretext task as a sequence verification problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In (sequential) verification, one predicts the ‘temporal validity’ of the sequence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this work, the authors explore the task of <strong>whether a sequence of video frames is in the correct temporal order</strong>. To do so, they had to use a sampling scheme in order to sample the videos. The reason this is important is of course the computational complexity.</p>

<p>To this end, <strong>they sampled images with high motion</strong>, based on the mean optical flow magnitude per frame. In order to create positive and negative tuples, samples of five frames were used as an input. <strong>Positive samples</strong> correspond to the <strong>correct order</strong>, while <strong>negative</strong> ones refer to frames in the <strong>wrong order</strong>. The following image further illustrates the difference.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/self-supervised-learning-videos/video-shuffling-eccv-2016.png" alt="video-shuffling-eccv-2016">
<em>An example of video shuffling, positive and negative examples. Taken from the original work [1]</em></p>

<p><strong>Training trick</strong>: During training, the authors used the same beginning and ending frame, while <strong>only changing the middle frame for both positive and negative examples</strong>. As a consequence, the network is <strong>encouraged to focus on this signal to learn the subtle difference</strong> between positives and negatives, rather than irrelevant features.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/self-supervised-learning-videos/shuffle-model-architecture-overview.png" alt="shuffle-model-architecture-overview">
<em>An overview of the proposed network architecture of [1]. The image is taken from the original work.</em></p>

<p>Based on the architecture scheme, it is worth noting that each frame is processed <strong>independently</strong> by the AlexNet, while the image features outputs are concatenated for the final classification.</p>

<p>Finally, they used about <strong>900k image tuples</strong>, with a balanced mini-batch ratio of positive and negative instances. As it was found out, it is critical to have a larger percentage of negative examples for order verification (75%).</p>

<h4 id="results-and-discussion">Results and discussion</h4>

<p>The question that was posed was <strong>what does the model really learn from the temporal structure</strong>? In the following image, the authors claim to display the <a href="https://theaisummer.com/receptive-field/" target="_blank">receptive fields</a> (marked in red boxes) for these units. As our network is trained on human action recognition videos, many units show a preference for human body parts and pose, since they are related to high motion. Although it is referenced in the paper as a receptive field the reality is that this is the feature activation of the layer.</p>

<em>Visualizing activations, taken from [1]</em></p>

<p>Numerically, by combining this scheme with imagenet pretrained weights, we get almost the same mean accuracy as with supervision from videos, as illustrated below (UCF sup. is the supervised database with action videos):</p>

<em>Results on action recognition, borrowerd from [1]</em></p>

<p>Finally, based on the presented results, one can validate that sequence verification requires an understanding of the video-based task at hand (action recognition).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Before I grokked the <code>Unmarshaler</code> interface, it was hard to know how to parse a complex <span>JSON</span> string into a type in one-shot, with or without preprocessing. There are many good <a href="https://blog.golang.org/json">blog</a> <a href="https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2016/advanced-encoding-decoding/">posts</a> on techniques to parse <span>JSON</span> in Go, but I had to learn this by experimentation to finally wrap my head around it.</p> <p>I’ll use an example from GitHub’s <code>/commits</code> REST API, using PR: <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/3365">ruby/ruby#3365</a>. I’ve <a href="https://github.com/kgrz/json-parsing-post/blob/master/commits.json">saved the response</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/kgrz/json-parsing-post">repo</a> where I’ve added full implementation of the example used in this post. The commits response from GitHub REST API is <em>very</em> verbose, depending on the PR size, and having depth greater than 1. In the hypothetical application that I’m writing, I need a list of “objects” that have the following information:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>MetaData</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Author</span> <span>string</span>
	<span>Committer</span> <span>string</span>
	<span>SHA</span> <span>string</span>
	<span>Message</span> <span>string</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That is, I want parse <a href="https://github.com/kgrz/json-parsing-post/blob/master/commits.json">this response</a> into a <code>[]MetaData</code> slice. I <strong>do not</strong> want to traverse the structs in the format of the responses in my main “business logic”, as that makes it hard to follow the important bits. I don’t want to use <code>interface{}</code> as a placeholder. A better trade-off, in my opinion and use case, is to do as much as possible during the parse phase to massage the data into the structure you want<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. I’m positive that this is a common use case. I ended up learning one way to do this cleanly almost by accident. First, the components involved:</p> <h4 id="use-anonymous-structs">Use anonymous structs</h4> <p>Anonymous structs can be used to avoid defining a concrete type and skip giving it a name for one-off use-cases. It’s heavily used in parsing and marshalling code paths, and testing. In our case, this technique can be used to define a “dirty” struct inside the <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> function on the fly, and use that for parsing the <span>JSON</span>.</p> <h4 id="implementing-unmarshaler-interface">Implementing Unmarshaler interface</h4> <p>Any type that has a <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> function on it implements the <code>Unmarshaler</code> interface. This type then can be used as the target for parsing a <span>JSON</span> sub tree or the entire <span>JSON</span> itself!</p> <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3> <p>First step is to mock out the main function:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>// This variable contains the raw json bytes that resulted from the</span>

Then I’m clean out slice based on a condition—I want to skip all the commits that start with <code>WIP</code>. Note that the <code>metadatas</code> variable defined inside the <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> function is defined as <code>[]MetaData</code> and not as <code>MetaDatas</code>, since doing that would result in a parse-loop. By design, <code>var metadatas Metadatas</code> and <code>var metadatas []MetaData</code> are not the same type.</p> <p>Finally, the filtered slice gets assigned to the underlying object that the <span>JSON</span> is getting parsed into.</p> <hr> <h4 id="a-note-about-performance">A note about performance</h4> <p>In these examples, the parse flow will create the entire <code>[]MetaData</code> slice, even though we filter out many of the elements. To my knowledge, this seems like a necessary hit to take. I’m not aware if there’s a way to avoid allocations by pre-pre-processing the incoming bytes to avoid the allocation in the first place. My thought process here is that if we didn’t filter, or cleanup the <span>JSON</span> data, it will anyway allocate all the objects, so this may not be a huge difference in allocations per se, but that’s just my opinion at this point.</p> <hr>  </div></div>]]>

    <p>Press Release<br>July 30, 2020</p>

<h3><strong>Google removes all Danish music from YouTube </strong></h3>
<h5>While the negotiations on a new joint Nordic agreement are in full swing, Google have chosen to leverage their total dominance in the market in the strongest way possible. On the evening of Thursday 30 July, Google announced that they will soon remove all Danish music content on YouTube.</h5>

<p>Under the auspices of the Nordic alliance of collecting societies, Polaris, negotiations on a joint Nordic agreement on the use of music on YouTube are currently in full swing. The agreement will replace the local agreements of the Norwegian, Finnish and Danish composers and songwriters’ societies, combining them in a single, joint agreement with Google. In the case of Koda, the national agreement for Denmark expired in April, after which it was temporarily extended – as is standard practice in the industry while negotiating a new agreement.</p>
<p>Now, however, Google have issued a new demand: if the agreement is to be temporarily extended, Koda must agree to reduce the payment provided to composers and songwriters for YouTube’s use of music by almost 70% – despite the fact that YouTube’s use of music has increased significantly since Koda entered into its last agreement with Google.</p>
<p>Of course, Koda cannot accept these terms, and Google have now unilaterally decided that Koda’s members cannot have their content shown on YouTube and that their fans and users on YouTube will be unable to listen to Koda members’ music until a new agreement is in place.</p>
<p>Although the parties involved in the negotiations on the new joint agreement are by no means in concord yet, progress has been made in recent weeks, and Koda is puzzled by the extremely aggressive approach taken by Google in the negotiations this time.</p>
<h5><strong>Koda’s media director, Kaare Struve, says:</strong></h5>
<p>‘Google have always taken an “our way or the highway” approach, but even for Google, this is a low point. Of course, Google know that they can create enormous frustration among our members by denying them access to YouTube – and among the many Danes who use YouTube every day. We can only suppose that by doing so, YouTube hope to be able to push through an agreement, one where they alone dictate all terms’.</p>
<p>Ever since the first agreement was signed in 2013, the level of payments received from YouTube has been significantly lower than the level of payment agreed to by subscription-based services.</p>
<h5><strong>Koda’s CEO, Gorm Arildsen, says:</strong></h5>
<p>‘It is no secret that our members have been very dissatisfied with the level of payment received for the use of their music on YouTube for many years now. And it’s no secret that we at Koda have actively advocated putting an end to the tech giants’ free-ride approach and underpayment for artistic content in connection with the EU’s new Copyright Directive. The fact that Google now demands that the payments due from them should be reduced by almost 70% in connection with a temporary contract extension seems quite bizarre’.</p>

        <p><span><span>H</span>ow to differ a bad contractor from a good partner?</span> There can be many advantages of working by the outsourced model, but also a lot of risks. Finding a good partner is difficult, but it is an ambitious and necessary task. We wrote this article to <span>differ</span> it from a bad and irresponsible contractor. What kind of mistakes do contractors make, so it`s not worth working with them?</p>
<h3><b>SIGN #1 WORK OF THE TEAM IS NOT VISIBLE</b></h3>
<p><span>The manager assured that the team was working and would show the result “in the nearest future”, and after weeks of work, it wasn`t clear what the result of the project is and whether work is underway.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>Use the Scrum project management methodology:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Carry out daily calls where show the status of the tasks</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make the result demonstration each sprint (2 weeks)</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Analyze the results of each sprint</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see not only the final result but also understand the progress along with the sprint</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see delays and problems on time and keep your finger on the pulse</span></p>
<h3><b>SIGN </b><b>#2 DOUBTFUL CODE QUALITY</b></h3>
<p><span>In a rush, programmers write low-quality code that cannot be supported. Because of this, in the future, it will be necessary to rewrite the system from scratch or it will not perform the necessary tasks and functions at all. </span><span>The system may run slowly due to poor-quality and unstructured code, so it will be extremely difficult and expensive to finalize a new module.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make and show a code quality assessment using special programs – professional tools for analysis</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Work on git-flow, where some programmers check others to avoid mistakes</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You don’t need to overpay for alterations</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get a working system that is easy to refine and scale</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Other programmers and teams can easily work with the code</span></p>
<h3><img src="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png" alt="Подрядчик в IT" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png 800w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-300x207.png 300w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></h3>
<h3><b>SING #3 NO DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT</b></h3>
<p><span>The contractor simply performs the task pool, not wanting to delve into the subtleties of the project and study it. </span><span>Developers just write the code the way they understand the task.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make a competitor analysis and study successful counterparts in the market to understand trends and delve deeply into the project</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Fix errors and improve the system along the way, playing the role of business analysts</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Developers write code, taking into account business requirements, think about creating a product that will be interesting and convenient for the user</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ The contractor isn’t just “hands” that build, but also a “head” that will find and come up with the best solution</span></p>
<h3><b>SING #4 JUST THE VISIBILITY OF WORK, MANY EXTRA MOVEMENTS</b></h3>
<p><span>The team creates the appearance of work – constantly there are new documents with a description, new work files. </span><span>The code is simply written just for fact and over time it turns out that the functions aren’t logical, inconvenient, or impossible to use. </span><span>Business doesn’t get results – a system that can be used.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Iteratively create a finished product that can be used after the first sprints</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Instead of 20 sheets of documentation, make one prototype and clearly show how the new module will work</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Don’t just write code but offer a solution for business – work functions that are needed</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get the result – a system that you can use&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Save time and money</span></p>
<h3><b>SING</b><b> #5 DON`T CARE ABOUT DESIGN</b></h3>
<p><span>Bad contractors focus only on functionality and don’t consider design as an important stage in product development and as a tool to achieve project goals. </span><span>Don’t reuse logic/components from already developed system modules. </span><span>Don’t use a design system – a unified style and approach to project design.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Follow the best solutions of modern UI/UX design with care for the user</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Don’t just develop functionality to the level of “everything works fine”, but make a big emphasis on the visual part to the level of “comfortable and beautiful”</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Use ready-made solutions and components from already completed system modules</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Use the design system and templates in the design to speed up the work and improve its quality</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Time for design and engineering is allocated as efficiently as possible</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Users get a product that looks like they want to use it all the time – all because it has a responsive, understandable, convenient, inspirational design!</span></p>

<h3><b>SING</b><b> #6 GO TO NEW FUNCTIONS WITHOUT COMPLETING PREVIOUS</b></h3>
<p><span>For your product, you have conceived many functions that are described in the specifications for the contractor. He began developing all the functions at once but didn’t complete any of them properly. Six months later, all the modules are “almost ready” but none can be used.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Give the revised functions – correctly working modules that take into account all the scenarios. Screens are correctly displayed on all devices and all operating systems. Pages correctly show information, even if there is no data, there is no Internet or the user entered an incorrect value</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Develop all functions in stages, bringing them to the desired result – a modified functional that you can use</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Pass to the new task only after the previous one is fully completed</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see how your product is formed – gradually, but with visible results</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get working functions after the end of the current sprints, and not at the very end of the project when it turns out that something remains unfinished</span></p>
<p>We think you have found at least a couple of matches with the work of your current or ex contractor. Their mistakes and lack of professionalism can cost you the success of the entire project, so we advise you to carefully choose the company to which you are ready to entrust your business. We try to follow the principles described in the paragraphs “how it is needed”, taking care of you and the end-users of your product. Speaking of the importance of outsourcing, <span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/07/08/why-its-important-to-outsource-right-now/#a0dbea670e9a">Forbes wrote an excellent article</a>.</span></p>
<p>The next step after choosing a contractor will be writing a statement of work (SOW or specifications). In our article <span><a href="https://proarea.co/blog/how-to-make-correct-requirement-specifications/">“How to make correct requirement specifications”</a></span>, we have written everything you need to consider. Good luck with implementing your ambitious ideas!</p>

			<p><span>In this era of competition, the demand from app users is getting bigger and bigger every day. Businesses are bound to offer applications with incredible quality and which can satisfy customers on various fronts of the business. Today every large enterprise is worried about its business IT infrastructure that requires supporting such high-end apps that are advanced concerning cost, capability, security, scalability, and offers customization. This is where Kubernetes comes into the space of </span><strong><a href="https://l1n.com/cloud-computing/">cloud computing services</a>. </strong></p>
<p><b>Now you must be thinking:</b></p>
<h2><b>What is Kubernetes?</b></h2>
<p><span>An </span><span>open-source </span><span>system that divides workload through </span><span>an orchestration technique and </span><span>apps for servers that gather round in a data center is Kubernetes.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is the </b><b>Kubernetes advantage</b><b>?</b></h2>
<p><span>Over the years </span><span>Kubernetes capabilities for enterprises </span><span>have been witnessed by successful project accomplishments. It assists applications to be more functional, flexible and saves your hard-earned money as it requires lesser workforces for managing IT.</span></p>
<p><span>Kubernetes is a Google product that is a part of the </span><span>Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNFC). CNFC brings along with itself strong engrossment and contribution from several organizations (small and large). </span></p>
<h2><b>Why Kubernetes Should Be Your Next Infrastructure</b><b>?</b></h2>
<p><span>If you are planning to take on Kubernetes for the growth of your business then you need to know its fundamental business capacities and reasons as to why it is being adopted by enterprises.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s focus on </span><b>why enterprises prefer Kubernetes for their business IT infrastructure?</b></p>
<h3><b>Ensures Enhanced Scalability and Availability</b></h3>
<p><span>App success doesn’t depend just on its features but scalability determines the success of a particular app. Kubernetes being an orchestration system is a crucial management system to scale and enhance app performance automatically.&nbsp;Kubernetes auto-scaling is not only limited to infrastructure metrics but to custom metrics and all kinds of metric or resource usage metrics can be employed to boost the scaling procedure.</span></p>
<h3><b>Excellent for Businesses</b></h3>
<p><span>The world is incomplete without software and application development is the elementary tool for business development. </span></p>
<p><img src="https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.png" alt="" width="626" height="397" srcset="https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.png 626w, https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px"></p>
<p><span>Improving the quality of apps is a way to win many customers as reported by some of the organizations. Kubernetes directly contributes to these enhancements, with improved resource usage and reduced development cycles as reported by 53% of respondents. They are having more out of every penny spent and are building software faster than ever.</span></p>
<h3><b>Kubernetes Aids in IT Cost Optimization</b></h3>
<p><span>Kubernetes helps in reducing business infrastructure costs and can prove to be of great help for your vast scale business. It is highly competent in putting apps together which assists in optimal utilization of your cloud investments and hardware which in turn improves container-based architecture more conveniently.</span></p>
<h3><b>Solution for the Future</b></h3>
<p><b>Kubernetes is a convenient solution for many reasons like:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Every prime cloud vendor is backing Kubernetes for its offering various unusual solutions for it.</span></li>
<li><span>Many other container orchestration solutions&nbsp;also support the same in terms of adoption, cloud vendors’ support, and ecosystem.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Supports Your Application Run More Stable</b></h3>
<p><span>K8s can help you out if you are looking to check whether your app is running steadily or not. What it does is that it permits you to get rolling updates to modify your software with no prevention. K8s can further be set up in such a manner that it assists in highly accessible apps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Highly Economical When Compared to Other Solutions</b></h3>
<p><span>Based on your application requirements, incoming traffic and load by your app Kubernetes can easily auto-scale. With auto-scaling features during the hectic times of the year, a particular app can scale up its needed resources. This in turn will automatically reduce your infrastructure during the less loaded times of the year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Assists In Effective and Smooth Migration to the Cloud</b></h3>
<p><span>Kubernetes is an ideal solution whether you are thinking to re-host, re-platform, and re-factory. As K8s </span><span>runs constantly across every environment, clouds like&nbsp;AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premise it paves the way for porting your app on-premise to </span><span>cloud hosting services</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>smoothly.</span></p>
<h3><b>Help You Boost up Your Productivity</b></h3>
<p><span>You can attain the highest level of productivity if Kubernetes is well-executed into your engineering workflow. Drone and other such tools support making CI/CD pipelines swiftly and </span><strong><a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus" rel="nofollow">Prometheus</a></strong><span> makes the monitoring process easier.&nbsp;Everything is tailored precisely as per your needs with K8s massive array of technologies. Kubernetes ecosystem offers the maximum of its tools free to be used and are open-source which is a big add on benefit.</span></p>
<h3><b>Kubernetes Cloud-native Tech Stack Attracts Talents</b></h3>
<p><img src="https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.png" alt="" width="886" height="539" srcset="https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.png 886w, https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-300x183.png 300w, https://l1n.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2-768x467.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px"></p>
<p><span>According to reports by </span><strong><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted" rel="nofollow">Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019</a></strong><span>, Kubernetes is ranked 3</span><span>rd</span><span> and is the most preferred platform to work on. Many software engineers demand to work in companies that deploy cutting-edge technologies.</span></p>
<p><span>Your technology stack and procedures can be very attractive with an integrated and effective workflow for possible candidates. Also, your present workforce will get inspired to work on new technology which boosts the contentment in your development teams and can reduce member turnover in the future. In short, it’s a material benefit for your company.</span></p>
<h2><b>Future of Kubernetes….</b></h2>
<p><span>Kubernetes is on the verge of rising performance at present because organizations are deploying Kubernetes and due to the development of mobile apps. This is just the commencement of the new ways to adhere to the edge computing, </span><span>managed cloud hosting services</span><span>, and </span><span>machine-learning. Kubernetes is doing a marvelous job in transforming the world and it has a long way to go.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span><span>R</span>equirement specifications are the main project document, describing all its technical and non-technical issues. Any of your ideas are just ideas until specifications developed. In this article, we will explain why this document is so important, when it`s correct to begin development and what exactly it should contain.</span></p>
<h3><b>WHY YOU NEED REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS</b></h3>
<p><span>If you don’t describe the expected result, don`t formulate a clear task and project requirements, you will:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>overpay for work and edits;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>waste time;</span></li>
<li><span>get not at all what you want and again overpay for edits;</span></li>
<li><span>close the project due to the fact that there are no more resources for corrections.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>And in order to prevent this, it is important to write requirement specifications. In order for the team to understand specific tasks and be able to implement them so that the expectation and the final product result coincide.</span></p>
<h3><strong>THE SPECIFICATIONS` ROLE IN DIFFERENT PROJECT STAGES</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span><b> Formation of business requirements</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>This is the foundation for project implementation. At this stage goals and budgets are set. Here the requirement development begins because it determines the future product success. All further work on specifications should be based on business requirements.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span><b> MVP development</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>It’s almost impossible to build the perfect product on the first try. In any case, it will change based on the feedback of the market and users. Therefore, it is logical to start with MVP – the minimum viable product. For the development of MVP, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are as important as for the development of the main product. At this stage, the </span><span>specifications</span><span> task defines:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>basic functions and user interface needed to test a hypothesis;</span></li>
<li><span>criteria necessary for understanding the success of the implementation and launch of the first product version on the market.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>So, </span><span>specifications</span><span> at the MVP development stage describe which functions are needed and how it is necessary (minimal and sufficient) to implement in order to test the hypothesis.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv.png" alt="requirement specifications" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv.png 800w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv-300x207.png 300w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rlprkv-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span><b> Main product development</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>After the successful launch of MVP, </span><span>requirements</span><span> for the main product are finalized based on the results: a positive market reaction, as confirmation that the business model is working. That is necessary to take into account and describe in </span><span>specifications</span><span>, we wrote in detail in the 3rd section of this document. At this stage, </span><span>requirements </span><span>play a crucial role:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>take into account market features (business opportunities, necessary budgets, target audience);</span></li>
<li><span>define the project objectives;</span></li>
<li><span>demonstrate use cases;</span></li>
<li><span>captures functional, non-functional, and technical requirements so that the product is properly designed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>At this stage, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are a complete guide to action, completely describing all important points, starting from a business analysis of the market and target audience, ending with colors, fonts, and other details.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span><b> Marketing promotion</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>In good </span><span>specifications,</span><span> there is a place for market research, competitors, communication channels with potential users, and resources for promotion. Marketing promotion is the logical and necessary project support at the start and after it. If you don’t initially plan marketing activity, you probably won’t take into account the resources (in particular, the money) needed for a confident release. You run the risk of being left completely without promotion since the main resources will go to development. So, without the described marketing, you can confront a lot of problems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>lack of promotion resources;</span></li>
<li><span>lack of understanding of the market and its users;</span></li>
<li><span>failure to provide your product benefits to the audience;</span></li>
<li><span>and as a result – market failure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>At this stage, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are the answer to the question “what to do after the release?”</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>What will be the main costs?</span></li>

<p>This article documents the thought process and steps involved in refactoring a distributed monolith to microservices. We are going to remove API GW, use Amazon Event Bridge and implement BASE consistency in the system to truly decouple our microservices.</p>



<p><em>This blog is also available as a presentation. Reach out
if you would like me to present it at an event. </em></p>



<p>I will use the codebase from the previous installment to the series that can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/general/aws-serverless-you-might-not-need-third-party-monitoring/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The first part focuses on creating the codebase and implementing AWS native observability, monitoring and alerting services. As always you can find the code that we used in the respective GitHub repositories over here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroService" target="_blank">https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroService</a>.</p>



<h2>Original System</h2>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="original system (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/general/aws-serverless-you-might-not-need-third-party-monitoring/index.html" target="_blank">original system</a> is a distributed monolith that consists of three microservices. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-1024x715.png" alt="" width="1024" height="715" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-1024x715.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-300x210.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-768x536.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture.png 1111w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Original system (Click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within each project you can find an <strong>OpenAPI </strong>(<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroServicePerson/blob/master/part1/src/lambda/api/api-definition.yaml" target="_blank">part2/src/lambda/api/api-definition.yaml</a>) file that defines the API definition for each service.<strong> AWS CDK</strong> is used and they all follow the similar stock standard CDK project layout: Typescript for the CDK and <strong>ES6 JS</strong> for the application code. NPM commands have been written to do deployments and it also contains<strong> end-to-end tests </strong>using Mocha and Chai. In addition, each service contains a detailed README inside the /part2 path. Note that I only have a single Lambda for the API endpoint and do internal routing. Yes, I believe in a <strong>Lambalith for the API</strong> 😊 and also prefer JSON POST over REST (more about this later). </p>



<p>A <strong>problem </strong>arises as soon as these microservices start to call one another. We will focus on the creation of a new person to demonstrate how this <strong>tight coupling</strong> is working. </p>



<p>The client service stores clients and has basic <em>create-client</em> and <em>find-client</em> functionalities as well as an endpoint to increment the person count for a specific client. The person service also has basic <em>create-person</em> and <em>find-person</em> endpoints. When a person is created, it calls the common service which notifies me by email about the new person that was added using an SNS subscription. The common service first needs to do a lookup on the client service so that it can enrich the email. It also increments the counter on the client. Click on the image below to see the step-by-step path for creating a person:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-1024x553.png" alt="" width="1024" height="553" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-1024x553.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-300x162.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-768x415.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus.png 1442w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption> <br>Original system – full create person flow (Click to enlarge) </figcaption></figure>



<p>The <em>create-person</em> call is highly dependent on the common service and does not even know that the common service is dependent on the client service. As a result, the person service is also dragged down if either the common or the client service is down. Not to mention that it now has to wait for the completion of every step in the synchronous chain. This wastes money and increases the probability of hitting the API Gateway timeout of 29 seconds.</p>



<h2>Decoupling with Amazon Event Bridge</h2>



<p>Amazon Event Bridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to work with <strong>event-driven architectures</strong>. It works on a basic <strong>publish and subscribe</strong> model. We use it to emit certain events like: <em>person-created </em>and <em>client-created.</em> Other services can then listen to only the events that they want and act on it. The new system is refactored to incorporate this and remove the direct HTTP API calls between services. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-1024x522.png" alt="" width="1024" height="522" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-1024x522.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-300x153.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-768x391.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge.png 1531w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption> <br>New system (Click to enlarge)  </figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>client service</strong> has not changed much. It is still
fronted with API Gateway (GW). It now emits an event onto the bus whenever a
client is created. A new Lambda function is added that listens to the <em>create-person</em> events. This increments the person counter for that specific client.
This feature was previously on the common service but has now moved to the
client service.</p>



<p>The <strong>person service</strong> is working exactly as before. Just
like the client service, it also emits an event onto the event bus,
specifically the <em>create-person</em> event.</p>



<p>The <strong>common service</strong> no longer needs to be fronted by
API GW. Instead it listens to both the <em>create-client</em> and <em>create-person</em>
events. The common service stores the client data in its own DynamoDB table. It
uses this to look the client up within itself (locally), rather than calling an
HTTP API to get the data for a specific client. The common service still sends
an email when a new person is added. </p>



<p>From an <strong>external integration point of view</strong>, all API endpoints stayed exactly the same. The diagrams below clearly illustrate that each service is only concerned with its own data and responsibilities. The event that is emitted onto the bus is also added for convenience.</p>

<p><strong>Internally</strong> the common service has an Event Bridge Rule with the Lambda function as target. It listens to the <em>create-client</em> events and then stores only the client-id and client name fields within its own DynamoDB table. This <strong>removes the need for it to do an HTTP API call</strong> to the client service as it can now just do the lookup locally against its own data store.</p>

<p>The common service also listens to the <em>create-person</em> event. It <strong>looks up the client information in its own DynamoDB table</strong> and then sends the SNS message. <strong>At the same time</strong>, the client service also listens to the <em>create-person</em> events. It uses the client-id that comes with the event to increment the person counter for that specific client in the client service DynamoDB table. </p>

<h2>What has changed?</h2>



<p>We used Event Bridge to<strong> remove direct HTTP API calls</strong> between microservices. It also allowed us to <strong>move some logic</strong> to where it belongs. The common service should not be responsible to increment the specific client’s person counter in the first place. That functionality is now contained within the client service, where it belongs. </p>



<p>We basically borrowed two principles from the <strong>SOLID OOP principles</strong>: </p>



<ul><li>Single Responsibility – Each service is only concerned with its own core functionality.</li><li>Open Closed – Each service is now open for extension, but the core functionality is closed for modification.</li></ul>







<p>Then we introduced <strong>BASE consistency</strong> into the system: </p>



<ul><li><strong>B</strong>asic <strong>A</strong>vailability – Even if the client service is down the common service can still operate as it has a copy of the data. Thus the data layer/plane is still operational.</li><li><strong>S</strong>oft State – Stores don’t have to be write-consistent or mutually consistent all the time.</li><li><strong>E</strong>ventual Consistency – The system will become consistent over time, given that the system doesn’t receive input during that time.</li></ul>







<p>A BASE system is almost always going to be an <strong>AP system</strong> if you look at the CAP theorem. Meaning it favors <strong>A</strong>vailability and <strong>P</strong>artitioning over <strong>C</strong>onsistency. </p>

<p><strong>DynamoDB </strong>is an example of an <strong>AP system</strong> as well. Your data is stored on multiple 10GB partition drives spread over multiple Availability Zones. That replication takes a few milliseconds, up to a second or two. Obviously, there are cases where you need to read the data back directly after writing. That is why you can specify a Strongly Consistent read, which just goes back to the writer node and queries the data there instead of waiting for the data to have propagated to all nodes. </p>



<p><strong>S3 </strong>has <strong>read-after-write consistency for the PUT item</strong> command but all <strong>other commands are subject to eventual consistency.</strong> This means that after updating an item, the old content may still be returned for a short amount of time until the content of that file has propagated to all the storage nodes. There are more examples such as these all over the AWS ecosystem.</p>



<p>Event-driven architectures come with their own <strong>pros and cons</strong>. Firstly, you need to <strong>approach the problem with a different distributed mindset</strong> that needs to be present within the company/team as well. Event <strong>versioning and communication</strong> between teams that own microservices are also crucial. It is a good idea to have a service that keeps a <strong>ledger of all events that happen</strong> in the system. Worst case, this history of events can be replayed to fix any processing errors in the downstream processing. </p>



<p>Event bridge, like SNS and SQS, guarantees delivery of a message at least once. This means your <strong>system needs to be idempotent</strong>. An example of an idempotent flow is when the client is created and the common service does a PUT command into the DynamoDB table. If that event gets delivered more than once, it just overwrites the current client with the exact same data.</p>



<p>An example of a non-idempotent flow is when the person is
created. If the client service gets more than one message, it increments the
client-person counter more than once. There are ways to make this call
idempotent, but we’ll leave that for a different blog. </p>



<p>Another thing to consider is that not all systems can accept the delay that eventual consistency introduces into a system. It is perfectly acceptable in our system as a person will probably not be created immediately within one second after a client has been created. Thus, whenever the common service does the client lookup locally, it can be assured that the client data is always populated. </p>



<h2>Resilience to Failure</h2>



<p>One of the benefits that we have achieved by refactoring to a microservice system is that we are now r<strong>esilient to complete services failure</strong>. The client service can still operate if the person and common service is down. Similarly, the person service can operate on its own and is not dependent on the other services.</p>



<p>We also <strong>removed any timeout problems that was introduced</strong> by the previous architecture that synchronously chained API calls. If an Event Bridge target service (like Lambda, in our case) is down, it will retry sending the message with exponential bakeoff for up to 24 hours. </p>



<p>All Lambda functions that process the asynchronous events from Event Bridge have <strong>Dead Letter Queues</strong> (DLQ) …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the classical world, it is quite common that we could make an exactly the same copy of something. However, in the quantum world, the laws of physics impose a severe restriction on copying: It is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown state.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the No-Cloning Theorem in quantum theory.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-inverse-transpose-property">Kronecker Product Inverse-Transpose Property</h4>

<p>Conjugate transposition are distributive over the Kronecker product:</p>





<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-mixed-product-property">Kronecker Product Mixed-Product Property</h4>

<p>Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{C}^{r \times s}$, $C \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times p}$, and $D \in \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$, then</p>



<p>This has been proved in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker Product In Circuits</a>.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-expansion-property">Inner Product Expansion Property</h4>

<p>Suppose $|x\rangle$ is any unit vector whose $|x|^2 = \langle x | x \rangle = 1$. We have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)$</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-matrix-preserves-inner-product">Unitary Matrix Preserves Inner Product</h4>

<p>Given two complex vectors $x$ and $y$, multiplication by unitary matrix $U$ preserves their inner product.</p>



<p>Using the definition of inner product,</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="no-cloning-theorem">No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, copy, as it is the same to other quantum operators except measurement operators, is an reversible and linear operator.</p>



<p>Given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the copy operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to copy the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before copy.</p>



<p>We would like to write this transformation into equation.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the copy operator.</p>



<p>Note that for $| \psi \rangle$ we also used $|x\rangle$ which $| \phi \rangle$ is using, meaning that before copy, the “vacant” system is always the same. This is something we could guarantee.</p>



<p>We examine the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ using the copy property and all the properties in the prerequisite section.</p>



<p>Because $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle$ is scalar, we further have</p>



<p>Solving the above equation, we have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum copy operator that makes copy of any unknown state.</p>

<h3 id="more-restrict-no-cloning-theorem">More Restrict No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum theory, $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$, where $c$ is a non-zero complex number, represent the same physical state. If $|c \phi|^2 = 1$, then $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$ only have phase difference.</p>



<p>For example, $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ have exactly the same probability of collapsing to $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. However, $| \phi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_1$ while $| \psi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_2$.</p>



<p>More restrict No-Cloning Theorem states that “copying” any unknown state while abandoning the phase is not possible either.</p>



<p>Suppose we have such “copy” operator, the mathematical expression for “copy” will be as follows.</p>



<p>Similarly, we have</p>



<p>The norm of the two sides should be equivalent.</p>



<p>Solving the above equation, we have $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum “copy” operator that makes “copy” of any unknown state that has lost the phase information.</p>

<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>

<p>Since it is not possible to do copy in quantum world, how about transportation?</p>



<p>Concretely, given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the transportation operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to transport the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before transportation.</p>



<p>Note that although it is called transportation, it is more like a switch, where the two system states, one unknown and one known, got switched.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the transportation operator.</p>



<p>Similarly, we compute the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$.</p>



<p>Unlike copy, we did not find anything usual that prevents transportation.</p>

  <blockquote>
<p>TL;DR - These are my notes for a potential computer hobbyist personal computer architecture. Someone called it "Minix for motherboards".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This roughly describes an architecture of off the shelf microcontroller components that can be used to create a basic standalone PC, somewhere in the neighborhood of performance of an old 286/386 DOS style PC.</p>
<p>If I build this, it will almost certainly be done in Rust. I do hope to specify the protocol/operational semantics well enough that you could create a component that was written in Micro/Circuit Python, C/C++, Ada, or maybe even as an embedded linux PC.</p>
<p>I currently am working on other projects, but I feel like this would be a fun project to stream, or maybe even write a book about learning embedded systems, or learning Rust with embedded systems?</p>
<p><strong>If you'd be interested in taking a class building/using a system like this, or would be interested in seeing this happen, <a href="mailto:james.munns@ferrous-systems.com">send me a message</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to design a PC-ish architecture that makes it easy for people learning embedded systems to build a single component. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making the system resistant to failure of a single component</li>
<li>Use only protocols/components that can be easily purchased</li>
<li>Be adaptive to allow for variety of components used</li>
<li>Value simplicity over performance</li>
<li>Make the steps to initial success very short</li>
<li>Make this fun for me and other collaborators to work on</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="project-anti-goals">Project Anti-Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Designing something that is wholly useful in commercial deployments</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="interesting-ideas">Interesting Ideas</h2>
<p>These are ideas that I think will help make the project successful.</p>
<h3 id="every-component-is-a-microcontroller-any-microcontroller">Every Component is a Microcontroller - Any Microcontroller.</h3>
<p>The idea is to have every part (or <strong>Component</strong>) of the system be its own standalone microcontroller system. Honestly, this is how most computers work today anyway, but the idea is to be able to use almost any microcontroller, from 8051, to Arm Cortex-M, to RISC-V parts, for any piece of the PC. At some point, I can see people even making parts of the PC out of FPGAs as well.</p>
<p>This includes all of the following PC parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Main CPU/Processor</li>
<li>An input controller (Keyboard/Mouse/Touch)</li>
<li>A network interface (Ethernet/Wi-Fi/LPWAN)</li>
<li>A storage controller (SSD/SD/HDD/RAMFS/USB)</li>
<li>A Sound Card</li>
<li>A graphics card (framebuffer, shaders)</li>
</ul>
<p>The system should use a protocol that almost every device has support for, and is forgiving. For that reason, I plan to use SPI for system communication.</p>
<h3 id="the-bus-protocol-spi-but-weird">The Bus Protocol - SPI, but weird.</h3>
<p>So, SPI is a simple, fast, and reliable protocol, but the trick is that it is WAY easier to write a SPI Controller, rather than a SPI peripheral. Since I want things to be simplest for the people writing the Components, they should be the SPI Controllers. But this leaves us with a problem, how do we make a PC with N SPI Controllers work with a single SPI peripheral? Here is where it gets weird.</p>
<ol>
<li>Every Component is a SPI Controller, with SCK, COPI, and CIPO pins wired to a central <strong>Arbitrator</strong>.</li>
<li>Every Component also has two GPIOs:
<ul>
<li>An output that is a "Request" line. This signals to the Arbitrator that the Component would like to talk</li>
<li>An input that is a "Go-Ahead" line. This signals to the Component to begin talking to the Arbitrator</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this system, the Arbitrator will either support being a SPI Peripheral for a lot of lines, or will handle MUXing the SCK/COPI/CIPO pins as necessary.
The Arbitrator will decide which component it wants to talk to, and for how long.
When a Component pulls its Request line low, the arbitrator will eventually acknowledge this by pulling the Component's Go-Ahead line low.
The Component can begin clocking SPI data at whatever speed it feels like, up to the maximum speed supported by the Arbitrator.
When the Component is done sending/receiving data, it checks whether the Go-Ahead line is still low.
If so, then the message was "accepted" by the arbitrator.
If the Go-Ahead line is released high before the Component releases the Request line, this means that the arbitrator has "hung up" on the Component, meaning either an error or timeout has occurred.</p>
<h3 id="the-arbitrator-basically-a-northbridge-chip">The Arbitrator - Basically a Northbridge chip</h3>
<p>The Arbitrator has two primary tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arbitrating the Bus Protocol as described above, servicing and discovering components that have been connected</li>
<li>Managing memory allocations used to communicate between devices</li>
</ol>
<p>I've already described the lowest level of the protocol above - we'll use an awkward SPI communication. However I haven't described how the higher protocol layers work.</p>
<p>All devices will communicate through a mailbox system.
The arbitrator will take data from the Components, and place them in an in-memory object store.
Each created item will be assigned a UUID, which will be returned to the Component on creation.
This UUID can then be placed in a mailbox to another component, sending access to the data to that component.
Each item is read-only.</p>
<p>Example (psuedocode):</p>
<pre><span>// A binary RPC messages are sent from Component to the Arbitrator
// The format will probably be binary, but maybe with an alternative
// command to use the following REPL format?
//
// Components are also assigned a UUID on boot. This Component has
// the own-address of 9ea8b6a7-2967-4db8-98b8-d4577548ed04.

// Data can be stored to the Arbitrator memory space. Data can then be
// referenced as inter-device storage using UUIDs as a reference. Data
// is allocated on a FIFO basis, with oldest memory items becoming
// dropped.
//
// The arbitrator may choose to limit the rate, maximum size or other
// parameters of creating memory items based on configuration.
CREATE(
    // number of bytes to write, can be set to zero for dynamic
    // length using something like COBS or when the Request
    // line is de-asserted
    13,

    // The payload of the data
    "Hello, world!",

    // No UUID provided to send to another component, just return
    // the newly created UUID. If provided, this would place
    // the created UUID into the mailbox of another component
    None,
)
// The following UUID is returned to the Component on success
-&gt; Result&lt;3b2fd5d1-ae16-46af-afc1-f60241d0a5b6, CreateError&gt;

// You can send data by reference to another component you know's

// are a FIFO queue of UUIDs that can be loaded by that Component

    // The data reference to send

    Some(32),
)
-&gt; Result&lt;(13, "Hello, world!"), GetError&gt;

// The other device can receive messages on a FIFO basis, and can view
// and remove the item at the top of the stack. If the Controller
// ends the message before all bytes are received, the item is still
// removed from the FIFO. Thiscan be used to simply drop the item on

<p>Write a simple bootloader that can enumerate on the bus, take an image, and reboot? PXII boot style? Would need to enumerate type

<h2 id="the-first-implementation">The First Implementation</h2>
<p>These are ideas for possible first implementation of the PC architecture described above</p>
<h3 id="a-simulator-with-real-world-hooks">A Simulator with real-world hooks</h3>
<p>I could create a simulated environment for these components, using no_std libraries and using TCP over localhost to emulate the SPI target environment, basically providing an I/O library or a "HAL" for simulating each component inside of a system. Maybe even port RTIC to the simulated environment, or even just use QEMU, using Semihosting for simulated SPI/GPIOs?</p>
<p>With a little work, I could also probably have an arbitrator or even just a simple SPI controller sit outside of the PC, bridging one or more simulated components to a shared network with physical components.</p>
<p>This would allow me to bring up multiple devices quickly, both from a Component software …</p></div></div></div>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hypervisor memory introspection (HVMI) has been around for quite some time now, and there are several open-source projects utilizing virtual-machine introspection (VMI), one way or another. Generally, existing projects focus on debugging or tracing the execution of a guest VM. In this blog post, we introduce a slightly different approach to memory introspection; live protection of guest VMs. We cover the motivation behind our HVMI engine, how it was conceived, how it evolved over time, and finally, why we made it available for everyone.</p>

<p>Throughout this blog, we assume the reader has some basic knowledge about virtualization technologies (Intel VT-x specifically) and about OS internals (both Windows and Linux), although we try to cover as much ground as possible when it comes to technical details.</p>

<h2 id="what-hvmi-is">What HVMI Is</h2>

<p>Memory introspection is the technique of analyzing the contents of a guest VM from outside. The most common way to achieve this is using a hypervisor – running guest VMs are analyzed or introspected by the hypervisor. The CPU context can be viewed, the contents of the physical memory can be observed, and so on. In addition to simply analyzing the state of the VM, the introspection logic, or HVMI (how we refer to it from here on) also leverages the virtualization features provided by the CPU to provide security.</p>

<p>For example, by using the Extended Page Table (EPT) feature provided by Intel CPUs, HVMI overrides the guest OS memory protection policies. HVMI could, for example, enforce a no-execute policy for certain memory areas, and an exploit would fail even if it compromised the OS kernel. In addition to using the EPT to enforce memory access restrictions, HVMI can also use other virtualization capabilities to offer security. It can prevent modification of certain critical resources, such as control registers or model specific registers. Rootkits or exploits that rely on modifying these will fail because HVMI blocks the modifications.</p>

<p>HVMI is not about just advantages; it does have some drawbacks. One of the most important disadvantages of HVMI is the semantic gap – from outside the VM, we see only raw physical memory, with no apparent meaning. To do something useful, we must infer what those memory pages contain. Is it a process structure, is it a stack page, etc. In addition to the semantic gap, providing protection for certain system resources may prove challenging, from a performance point of view. Many legitimate accesses made inside a page that contains a protected structure may induce a severe performance overhead; this makes choosing what structures to protect a very difficult task. Finally, implementing HVMI is often very complex since it often requires reverse-engineering chunks of OS kernel, advanced knowledge about virtualization and, of course, software engineering.</p>

<h2 id="hvmi-history">HVMI History</h2>

<p>HVMI began as a research idea almost 10 years ago (late 2011). The team initially consisted of only one researcher (yours truly), who developed the initial PoC (simple driver-object protection via EPT, to block the TDL rootkit). Once the blessing from the powers that be was received, more time and effort was invested into this research, and the team began to grow. What was initially very straightforward code capable of protecting a handful of non-paged kernel memory pages on Windows 7 grew to become a beast capable of protecting all Windows versions starting with Windows 7, several Linux distros, and, on each of these, even user-mode processes, from various types of attacks.</p>

<p>HVMI was available as a commercial product in 2017, as part of the SVE package – Security for Virtualized Environments. During this time, it was polished, performance was improved, and several new features were developed. In late 2019, we decided to open-source the technology to make it available for everyone to see, use, play with, and extend with new features and capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="how-hvmi-works">How HVMI Works</h2>

<p>In essence, HVMI requires a hypervisor that provides the required API to provide protection. The required API can be explored in the official documentation TODO ref. Once such an API is provided, HVMI places several types of hooks inside the guest. For example, it can intercept control register 3 (CR3 - the register containing the address of the page-tables used for translating linear addresses to physical addresses) – this way, HVMI intercepts context switches inside the guest. By intercepting, for example, SYSCALL MSR writes, HVMI intercepts and blocks attempts to manipulate the SYSCALL entry point address. Most importantly, it uses the EPT to alter physical memory access permissions, thus overriding and restricting access to certain areas of the guest memory.</p>

<h3 id="general-architecture">General Architecture</h3>

<p>The HVMI engine is a standalone library, self-contained (it has no explicit external dependencies), and can be run in user-mode, kernel-mode, or even VMX root-mode. It is written entirely in C, with small bits and pieces written in assembly. The HVMI engine expects an interface containing several API functions to be exposed to it by whatever integrates with it. In this context, the integrator is a tool that binds the HVMI library to a particular hypervisor which provides a uniform API.</p>

<p>Supported hypervisors include our internally built Napoca hypervisor TODO ref, and the well-known open-source hypervisors Xen and KVM. Using the Napoca hypervisor, the HVMI engine runs directly inside VMX root, alongside the HV. In Xen and KVM, the HVMI engine runs as a regular user-mode process inside a special VM (or domain), or even dom0. The general architecture of HVMI is illustrated in the following image:</p>

<p><img src="https://hvmi.github.io/blog/assets/architecture.png" alt="General HVMI architecture on Xen/KVM"></p>

<p>From a functional perspective, HVMI is an event-driven library. When introspection is enabled for a guest VM, HVMI starts by identifying the guest operating system type, version, to find various important structures inside its memory. This process is asynchronous, meaning that once the initialization function returns, there’s no guarantee that HVMI has finished initialization; some parts of the guest introspection process occur when various events take place (for example, when CR3 is written). Once introspection is enabled, HVMI kicks-in when interesting events take-place within the guest; when a process is created or terminated, when a new memory region is allocated inside a protected process, or when memory accesses take place inside a protected region.</p>

<h2 id="making-use-of-hvmi">Making Use of HVMI</h2>

<p>Although we won’t go into very deep details (yet!) regarding the internals of the HVMI engine, here’s a list of the most important features HVMI exposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The list of loaded kernel mode drivers, with load/unload events;</li>
  <li>The list of user-mode processes, with create/terminate events;</li>
  <li>For processes that are protected, the list of loaded user-mode DLLs with load/unload events, and the list of Virtual Address Descriptors for that process with alloc/free events;</li>
  <li>On Windows, access to the Page Frame Number (PFN) Database;</li>
  <li>On Windows, the ability to parse the object tree (this is currently used to search for driver-objects inside guest memory, but it can easily be extended to handle any kind of object);</li>
</ul>

<p>As for OS agnostic features HVMI provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guest hardware registers state query;</li>
  <li>Guest physical memory access;</li>
  <li>Ability to place read/write/execute hooks on physical memory;</li>
  <li>Ability to place read/write/execute hooks on virtual memory;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on control registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on model specific registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on descriptor table registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to intercept exceptions that take place inside the guest (for example, #PF, #BP, etc.);</li>
  <li>Ability inject exceptions inside the guest;</li>
  <li>Access to swapped out guest memory (by injecting #PF inside the guest);</li>
  <li>Ability to hide certain guest memory contents (reads issued inside the guest will be fed with custom values);</li>
  <li>Advanced instruction decoding and handling (the disassembler used by HVMI provides extended information about the decoded instructions, making information extraction and emulation very simple)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="protection-features">Protection features</h3>

<p>The primary purpose of the HVMI engine is to, above all, provide protection. The following list contains the main types of threats HVMI was built to mitigate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Binary exploits inside protected processes;</li>
  <li>Code and data injection techniques inside protected processes;</li>
  <li>Function hooks inside protected processes, on designated system DLLs;</li>
  <li>Rootkits (various techniques are blocked, such as inline hooks inside the kernel or other drivers, SSDT hooks, Driver-object hooks, system register modifications, etc.);</li>
  <li>Kernel exploits;</li>
  <li>Privilege escalation;</li>
  <li>Credentials theft;</li>
  <li>Deep process introspection (prevents process creation if the parent process has been compromised);</li>
  <li>Fileless malware (powershell command line scanning).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="start-contributing">Start Contributing</h2>

<p>We see great potential for the HVMI project, which is why we decided to open-source it and make it available to everyone. Researchers are welcome to clone the project, run it, experiment, and add new features. We also accept pull-requests – if you think your feature is cool enough, be sure to make it available on the main HVMI repo!</p>

<p>Intel is continuously developing new virtualization technologies which make HVMI better and faster. Some of these have already been released, such as the Virtualization Exception (#VE), VM Functions (VMFUNC) and Sub Page Permissions (SPP), and HVMI makes use of them. Others, such as Hypervisor Linear Address Translations (HLAT) have recently been announced, and will make it into silicon in the upcoming years. We are sure that other technologies are yet to come, showing that both hardware vendors and software developers want to invest time and effort to create new virtualization features!</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Service meshes have attracted an enormous amount of hype around them. With at least a few talks about service meshes during each tech conference, one can easily be convinced that having a service mesh in their infrastructure is a must. However, hype isn’t a good indicator of whether the new shiny tech is the right solution for your problems. So below, I’ll try to express an anti-hype opinion on service meshes to hopefully make it less confusing when you want to decide whether you may or may not need one.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/rick.png" alt="rick"></span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a lesson here, and I’m not going to be the one to figure it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
— Rick Sanchez
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_invention">The invention</h3>
<p>Let’s take a step back in history and take a look at one of the <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/envoy-7-months-later-41986c2fd443">early articles</a> about introducing Envoy at Lyft.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, almost every company with a moderately-sized service oriented architecture is having the same problems that Lyft did prior to the development and deployment of Envoy:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An architecture composed of a variety of languages, each containing a half-baked RPC library, including partial (or zero) implementations of rate limiting, circuit breaking, timeouts, retries, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differing or partial implementations of stats, logging, and ….</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>While Envoy is not a service mesh by itself, the outlined problems describe the exact reason why service meshes were invented. They add “rate limiting, circuit breaking, …” and other reliability, observability, and security features to the services by enforcing the communication to go through the service mesh proxies, a data plane. Additionally, they require a separate component, a control plane, to control the configuration.</p>
<p>However, at this point, a lot of people miss the context in which service meshes were introduced. Service meshes are able to solve the problem not because it’s impossible to solve them in any other way. There are many battle-proof RPC libraries that take on the challenges of a separate data plane layer, <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finagle">Finagle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/grpc">gRPC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/line/armeria">Armeria</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/servicetalk">Servicetalk</a>, to name a few. After all, the very first service mesh - Linkerd 1.0 <a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd">is powered by Finagle</a>. The RPC libraries will need a component which provides service discovery and configuration management to make it a true mesh. For instance, Zookeeper, or Consul, a component that service meshes call a control plane.</p>
<p>Why introduce a new concept to solve the problems that have been solved before? The service mesh concept wasn’t introduced to address problems that hadn’t been addressed before but rather address them in a way that doesn’t require any modifications to the application code, which is incredibly convenient when it’s hard to introduce an RPC layer into an existing heterogeneous microservice environment.</p>
<p>When you hear service mesh, Istio with Envoy might be the first thing that comes to mind, but it wasn’t the first service mesh to enter the market. Linkerd authors who pioneered the space, described exactly this situation in the <a href="https://linkerd.io/2017/04/25/whats-a-service-mesh-and-why-do-i-need-one/#why-is-the-service-mesh-necessary">"why is the service mesh necessary"</a>. Interestingly, in many hype-y articles on the Internet this context is often forgotten, or omitted.</p>
<p>Solving a problem well, even if it’s a problem that a lot of people have, doesn’t magically provide the tech with a lot of hype. There is always a sponsor behind it. I don’t know who the sponsor was here, and I’m going to speculate, but it’s hard to sell an RPC library in the world where open source is a fundamental requirement. There is no clear business model there, that’s why most of the mature RPC libraries were open-sourced by large tech companies for which it’s not a part of the core business model. A library is just code, not a piece of infrastructure. Service meshes are a different story. It’s an isolated non-trivial piece of infrastructure. As a vendor, not only can you provide consultancy around the configuration and deployment, but you can also sell complete hosted solutions around it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_disillusionments">Disillusionments</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve established the problems, the solution, and most importantly, the context in which the solution was made, let’s take a look at the alternatives. The most obvious one, in the spirit of KISS, is to use an RPC library for your preferred language. Here is where the context is crucial: if you have a large fleet of services, each written in its own language/ecosystem, and the only language that they share is HTTP then having a single shared RPC library is going to be hard. Perhaps, you’ve got a fabric of deployed and running services, but everyone is afraid of touching them, no one knows how they work, and each redeploy is an adventure. A service mesh is here to help you, because at least you’ll be able to roll out new infrastructure features to the mesh regularly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have a fleet of healthy services written in a single application stack, then it’s a good idea to think twice before introducing a service mesh. By simply introducing or evolving a shared RPC library, you’ll get the exact same benefits and avoid dealing with the downsides of maintaining service meshes. By studying the service mesh limitations thoroughly, you can avoid finding yourself in the trough of disillusionment.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/curve.png" alt="Hype Cycle"></span></p>
<div>
<h4 id="_different_ecosystem">Different ecosystem</h4>
<p>The ecosystem of the service mesh of your choice will likely be different from the ecosystem of your services. Beautiful websites always make you believe that the solution is plug’n’play, always works and never goes down. In reality, sooner or later problems, bugs, quirks in behaviour will reveal themselves, as they always do. At that point, you’ll need to have engineers who work on the service-mesh’s ecosystem which when it’s different from the main app, effectively limits the set of people who can introduce changes or fix problems. This is likely to reintroduce silos, which is against the whole DevOps spirit. Yes, having a DevOps team of engineers who are doing DevOps-y things <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/2012/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-devops-team/">is against DevOps</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_unnecessary_overhead">Unnecessary overhead</h4>
<p>Not only having a proxy in front of each service adds overhead (often significant, talking about <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/performance-and-scalability/">90pt</a> rather than 99pt in the performance summary <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-response-time/">doesn’t make software run faster</a>) and consumes resources, but you also requires time (or rather a team of people) to manage them. Yes, it can help to make some of the tasks potentially easier - yay, you can now add canary deployments with a few lines of YAML to simple applications now. However, you still need to manage canary deployments of the proxies themselves which don’t have a proxy in front of them. The problems just get pushed up the stack.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_limiting_your_architecture_to_what_the_proxy_supports">Limiting your architecture to what The Proxy supports.</h4>
<p>As you’re reading this paragraph, HTTP/3 is slowly being rolled out to the Internet. It uses UDP as transport. Why use UDP rather than create a completely new protocol you ask? That’s because anything but TCP and UDP is simply “blocked” by the boxes, various proxies on the internet - routers, gateways, etc. This phenomenon got named <a href="https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en/why-quic/why-ossification">ossification</a>. So, only TCP or UDP are left is the practical chose, and even UDP is partially blocked by various corporate proxies which slows down the adoption.</p>
<p>Even though your microservice environment is probably much smaller compared to the Internet, you can draw parallels with service meshes. Proxies can ossify your application architecture by limiting how your services talk to each other, and there is not much benefit in having proxies if you can bypass them. Suppose you want to build a reactive application which is using RSocket over pure tcp? Or perhaps a message-driven application using an actor model? Or maybe push the performance boundaries with Aeron? Not going to happen until the box in the middle becomes aware of the protocol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_do_i_need_one">Do I need one?</h3>
<p>What does it all mean for you as an engineer? The answer to whether you need to adopt the service mesh approach comes down to the state of the microservice environment you’re trying to improve. As we have established, compared to an RPC framework, service meshes allow you to:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deploy the infra changes more often than deploying your services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce infra changes without touching the service code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The point 1. is important when for whatever reason you can’t redeploy your services very often, e.g. maybe no one remembers how it’s done anymore, or maybe there are other restrictions. The point 2. is important when your stack is heterogeneous, e.g. some services are built in Go, some in Java, some in Haskell, etc. Where are you on the interval from a huge set of heterogeneous services with unknown deployment schedules to a set of homogenous regularly deployed services defines whether a service mesh is the best solution for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Service meshes have a lot of hype around them, and way too much in my opinion. However, before committing to a piece of technology, it’s crucial to understand the problems it solves, and the context in which the solution was made. A service mesh is not an ultimate “good practice” but simply one of the patterns to solve a set of issues, and it’s quite a heavy one.</p>
<p>Rather than jumping on board, look carefully - the last thing you want is to find out that you have invested in a solution for a problem that you don’t have. Service meshes are an amazing piece of tech solving a whole lot of problems. Not in every case, it is the best solution.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

<p>As usual, when a new blog post comes out on <a href="https://blog.golang.org/">blog.golang.org</a>, I’m all
eager to read it as soon as possible. The most recent one, <a href="https://blog.golang.org/contributors-summit">Contributors
Summit</a>, is a nice write-up on the issues that the Go
contributors have been talking about. While reading it, I stumbled upon a sentence that made me
write this post. Here is is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, it would be nice if io.Reader accepted a context so that blocking read operations
could be canceled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gave me chills. This is what <code>io.Reader</code> would look like with a context.</p>

<pre><code>type Reader interface {
        Read(ctx context.Context, p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
</code></pre>

<p>I did some research and found that some people already <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20280">proposed this
change</a> for Go 2. Thankfully it received a decent amount
of thumbs down, so it’s likely not making it.</p>

<p>This post is about all of the things that are wrong with the <code>"context"</code> package, why it is useful
 despite that, and that Go 2 should do something about it. So, grab some popcorn and let’s get
 started!</p>

<h2 id="go-is-a-general-purpose-language">Go is a general purpose language</h2>

<p>First things first, let’s establish some ground. Go is a <em>good</em> language for writing servers, but Go
is not a <em>language for writing servers</em>. Go is a <em>general purpose programming language</em>, just like
C, C++, Java or Python. For example, I’ve been using Go for about 2 years and I’ve never written a
single server in it.</p>

<p>For this reason, when designing the Go language and it’s standard library, we need to approach it
from a general purpose language perspective. Now, I’m not trying to say that context is only useful
for server people. But mostly, it is.</p>

<h2 id="context-is-like-a-virus">Context is like a virus</h2>

<p>This is the first and most important problem with context: it spreads! As mentioned in <a href="https://blog.golang.org/context">this blog
post about the context package</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At Google, we require that Go programmers pass a Context parameter as the first argument to every
function on the call path between incoming and outgoing requests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every such function also needs to propagate the context down it’s call path, or else it wouldn’t be
fully cancelable. This means that all the potentially slow functions from other libraries that are
being called from a function accepting a context should also accept a context.</p>

<p>In short, if you’re writing a library that has function which can take some significant amount of
time and your library is <em>potentially</em> going to be used by a server application, you have to accept
a context in those functions.</p>

<p>That’s how context spreads like a virus. What’s bad about that? Let’s recap:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go is a general purpose language.</li>
<li>If a library is <em>potentially</em> going to be used by a server, it should accept a context.</li>
<li>Now, everyone has to deal with the context, even the ones who don’t need it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, I can just pass <code>context.TODO()</code> everywhere, but that’s just gross, it hurts readability,
makes my code look ugly and simply removes a part of fun I have with Go.</p>

<p>If the Go language ever comes to the point where I’d have to write this</p>

<pre><code>n, err := r.Read(context.TODO(), p)
</code></pre>

<p>put a bullet in my head, please.</p>

<p>You might argue: <em>A library can provide two version of each function, one with a context and one
without a context.</em> Sure, just take a look at the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/"><code>"database/sql"</code></a> package. Although it does solve the problem
partially, it smells quite bad.</p>

<p>Also, imagine teaching Go to a student. You start explaining the context-equipped <code>io.Reader</code>
interface (or anything else which occasionally requires a context) to them and they ask: <em>What is
that <code>ctx context.Context</code> thingy there?</em> And the answer would probably just be: <em>Don’t worry about
that, just pass <code>context.TODO()</code> there for now.</em> Sounds a lot like <code>public static void</code> to me.</p>

<p>The message is: Context spreads like a virus and I (alongside almost everyone who doesn’t write
servers in Go) don’t want to deal with it when I don’t have to.</p>

<h2 id="the-context-package-itself-is-not-that-good">The <code>"context"</code> package itself is not that good</h2>

<p>The first thing is a personal opinion, but for me, the <code>context.Context</code> interface has too many
methods. Now, the more serious problems.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-use-ctx-value-in-my-non-existent-company-you-re-fired">If you use <code>ctx.Value</code> in my (non-existent) company, you’re fired</h3>

<p>I’m not sure who came up with this idea that context should carry a map of meaningless objects to
meaningless objects. There are just so many things that are wrong with it. Let’s list a few:</p>

<ol>
<li>An obvious one, it’s not statically typed at all.</li>
<li>It requires documenting which values (keys and their types) a certain function supports and uses.
As we all know, documentation is mostly a code that never runs.</li>
<li>It’s very similar to thread-local storage. We know how bad of an idea thread-local storage is.
Non-flexible, complicates usage, composition, testing.</li>
<li>This probably doesn’t happen often, but it’s prone to name collisions.</li>
<li>It’s just magic. An error-prone magic.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know that <code>ctx.Value</code> makes some things easier. But, I believe that designing your APIs without
<code>ctx.Value</code> in mind at all makes it always possible to come up with alternatives.</p>

<h3 id="context-is-mostly-an-inefficient-linked-list">Context is mostly an inefficient linked list</h3>

<p>The way <code>WithCancel</code>, <code>WithDeadline</code>, etc. constructors from the <code>"context"</code> package work is they
create a linked list. Among other things, this sometimes requires creating a
<a href="https://golang.org/src/context/context.go#L261">goroutine</a> for <code>WithCancel</code>, which propagates
cancelation signals from the previous context to the new one. Of course, if the context is never
canceled, this goroutine is leaked.</p>

<p>The <code>WithValue</code> constructor takes a context and returns a context which propagates the previous
context but also contains a value under the specified key. This is, obviously, achieved by creating
another node in the linked list, the purpose of which is to return the correct value for that key
and propagate the previous context otherwise. So, <code>ctx.Value</code> is not only a map of meaningless
objects to meaningless objects, it’s also a terribly slow map of meaningless objects to meaningless
objects.</p>

<h3 id="and-lastly">And lastly</h3>

<pre><code>ctx context.Context
</code></pre>

<p>is a lot like</p>

<pre><code>Foo foo = new Foo();
</code></pre>

<p>One of the things Go was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnDgT73v8s">created to avoid</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-the-context-package-actually-solve">What does the <code>"context"</code> package actually solve?</h2>

<p>Despite all of the bad things described above, the <code>"context"</code> package is genuinely useful, because
it solves one thing that is kinda hard to do in Go: <strong>cancelation</strong>. That’s the only problem the
<code>"context"</code> package really solves (or attempts to solve).</p>

<p>Let’s face it, cancelation in Go is hard. There is a whole talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDDwwePbDtw">‘Advanced Go Concurrency
Patterns’</a>, which discusses this problem in depth. This
talk happened before the <code>"context"</code> package was introduced into the Go standard library and thus it
discusses solutions to the cancelation problem which only involve simple channels.</p>

<p>There are number of reasons why solutions proposed in the talk don’t scale very well. Here are a few
of them:</p>

<ol>
<li>The cancelation channels are usually not accepted by other libraries and functions and thus
cancelation is only possible ‘in-between’ the slow operations.</li>
<li>Considering a ‘tree of goroutines’ (where children goroutines are the ones spawned by the parent
goroutines), it’s easy to cancel the whole tree (just close the cancelation channel), but it’s
harder to cancel a sub-tree (you need to introduce another channel for that, or some other
solution).</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>"context"</code> package does solve these problems. Inefficiently and with numerous problems, but
solves them better than anything else out there. <strong>In Go, we need to be able to solve the
cancelation problem</strong>. Solving it is usually necessary anytime a decent usage of goroutines is
involved.</p>

<h2 id="go-2-should-explicitly-address-the-cancelation-problem">Go 2 should explicitly address the cancelation problem</h2>

<p>I think it’s a weakness of the Go programming language that we needed to introduce a package like
<code>"context"</code>. Go makes it very easy to create goroutines and communicate between them. However, the
<code>"context"</code> package is a proof that Go makes it hard enough to <em>arrange goroutines to finish</em>. I
believe this problem should be solved directly in the language. The language should provide a
solution, which is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simple and elegant.</li>
<li>Optional, non-intrusive and non-infectious.</li>
<li>Robust and efficient.</li>
<li>Only solves the cancelation problem. Values can be omitted. Timeouts can also be implemented on
top of a very simple cancelation.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might argue: <em>I like context, it’s an elegant solution to the problem without changing or
complicating the language</em>. I disagree. For all the reasons described above it’s not an elegant
solution and although it’s not an integral part of the language, it is and is becoming more and more
an integral part of the libraries. In the end, it makes the language harder to use.</p>

<p>I have a few solutions in mind, but I’ll leave them for another post or a proposal, or I’ll leave
them for myself if someone comes up with a better solution. The purpose of this post is just to
point out the problem.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This post was trying to point out a problem in the Go language. In short, cancelation is a problem
in Go and the <code>"context"</code> package does not solve this problem very well. I can’t think of any other
solution that would solve this problem good except for a language change. That is up for Go 2.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I’m looking forward to your feedback and <del>hate comments</del> objections ;).</p>

It’s an act of self-ownership, self-education. It’s about setting your own curriculum, defining your own worldview, deciding for yourself what is important.

(@visakanv) <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1087436197410959361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2019</a></blockquote>  <h2 id="why-i-take-notes">Why I Take Notes.</h2> <p>Oftentimes, when people think of taking notes, they associate it to <em>studying for an exam</em>.</p> <p>But the fact is, we are constantly learning new things everyday. So if you are all about living life to the fullest and improving yourself as a person, then why would you not transfer this concept of note-taking to your own personal life?</p> <p>One of the best thing <em>writing</em> things down can do for you is to <strong>sharpen your thinking</strong>. Sitting down and putting the work to synthesizing your thoughts can help to produce better quality ideas. If I find myself having an abstract thought in my head that it is hard to express in words, penning them down can help to solidify and refine the idea.</p> <p>In the rest of the article, I will be going through my note-taking journey, and the various techniques &amp; concepts I use to make my note-taking more effective.</p> <h2 id="active-recall-and-spaced-repetition">Active Recall and Spaced Repetition</h2> <p>When I was a student in junior college studying for ‘A’ Levels, the content we were learning were becoming more and more complex. So I started searching up study techniques to optimize my learning.</p> <p>I came across <a href="https://youtu.be/ukLnPbIffxE">Ali Abdaal’s YouTube videos</a> on <em>Active Recall</em> and <em>Spaced Repetition</em>, and these techniques stuck with me till this day. These were legitimate, scientifically backed<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> advice, in contrast to the plethora of “<em>Top 101 Study Tips</em>” listicles online that sounds good but doesn’t work.</p> <p>(Spoiler alert: Active Recall trumps other study techniques like rereading, highlighting and blindly writing notes, in terms of examination performance.)</p> <p> <strong>Active Recall</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>: <em>This involves retrieving information from your brain after learning something, typically through testing yourself. The act of recalling strengthens your ability to retain your information and solidifies the connections in our brain between different concepts.</em> <br><strong>Spaced Repetition</strong><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>: <em>The act of reviewing materials at spaced intervals. This is effective in memory retention and countering the forgetting curve.</em> </p> <p>If you ever want to learn something effectively, it is key to utilize both techniques to maximize your retention rate.</p> <h2 id="second-brain">Second Brain</h2> <p>On the never-ending quest for maximum productivity, I chanced upon an <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/">article by Forte Labs</a> that explained this conundrum I had in my head:</p> <blockquote> <p>How many brilliant ideas have you had and forgotten? How many insights have you failed to take action on? How much useful advice have you slowly forgotten as the years have passed?</p> <p>We feel a constant pressure to be learning, improving ourselves, and making progress. We spend countless hours every year reading, listening, and watching informational content. And yet, where has all that valuable knowledge gone? Where is it when we need it? Our brain can only store a few thoughts at any one time. Our brain is for <em>having</em> ideas, not storing them.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Without a little extra care to preserve these valuable resources, our precious knowledge remains siloed and scattered across dozens of different locations.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mind = Blown 🤯. This perpetual problem that has always bothered my mind (but could never find the words for it) was perfectly articulated by this excerpt.</p> <p>The article then introduced a solution: <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Building A Second Brain</a>. BASB is a methodology for “preserving your ideas, and turning them into reality”. The article explains it like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>We are constantly generating ideas. Yet, without a little extra care to preserve these valuable resources, our precious knowledge remains siloed and scattered across dozens of different locations.</p> <p>By offloading our thinking onto a “second brain,” we free our biological brain to imagine, create, and simply be present.</p> </blockquote> <p>Information overload is a plague of today’s society. Building a digital system where you can deposit all your thoughts and learnings there is quintessential for knowledge workers in this day and age.</p> <p>Another similar concept is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management">Personal Knowledge System</a>. PKM involves the bottom-up approach of <em>collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activities.</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p> <h2 id="note-taking-app-roam-research">Note-Taking App: Roam Research</h2> <p><i>(This segment talks about my favourite note-taking app, Roam Research. If you wish to skip to the next segment of the article, click <a href="#how_i_take_notes">here.</a>)</i></p> <p>In search for an appropriate medium for BASB, I discovered <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. I have been using it ever since and have never looked back.</p> <picture> <img src="https://www.ivan-ang.com/assets/roam-showcase.png" height="100%" width="100%"> <figure> <figcaption><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>'s official site.</figcaption> </figure> </picture> <h3 id="what-makes-roam-different-from-the-other-note-taking-apps">What makes Roam different from the other note-taking apps?</h3> <p>Note-taking apps typically function <strong>hierarchically</strong>.</p> <p>You create categories, and within each categories are sub-categories and within them contain notes. The problem with this is that we face the issue of deciding where to put these notes under, since they can belong to multiple categories.</p> <p>Roam Research is a note-taking application for <strong>networked thought</strong>.</p> <p>It seeks to make note-taking function more like how a brain processes information. Whenever you have an idea, your brain will create multiple associations to it. Thinking of linked concepts will help you recall that idea.</p> <p>Likewise, Roam seeks to associate notes with other notes via <em>bi-directional linking</em>, making it easier to connect your ideas. It becomes your second brain. Your notes do not just sit there idly like other note apps. Roam encourages serendipity and <em>Spaced Repetition</em> by letting you to continuously revisit past notes.</p> <p>For those tinkerers out there, you can even create your own custom CSS and JavaScript themes! (Shameless plug: check out my theme <a href="https://github.com/hiivan/CyanoRoam">CyanoRoam</a> on Github).</p> <h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3> <p>The bummer is that after their 31-days free trial, they start with a whopping $15/month and $7.50/month for students afterwards. If you are not willing to spend that much money on it, I recommend looking into other <a href="https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-alternatives">Roam alternatives</a> like <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and <a href="https://giffmex.org/experiments/stroll.experiment.html">TiddlyStroll</a>.</p> <p>(I was lucky enough to have been part of their beta program so my graph is free indefinitely 😁.)</p> <p>If you are interested to know more about how Roam Research works, you can also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpikCLhpIRY">Ali Abdaal’s video on Roam</a>.</p>  <h2 id="how-i-take-notes">How I Take Notes.</h2> <p>Personal Knowledge System/Building A Second Brain or whatever you want to call it, below are the multiple facets of how I take my notes. See and pick what works for you.</p> <h3 id="quick-capture">📸Quick Capture</h3> <p>Our brains are constantly coming up with new ideas. Sometimes, this can get very distracting and take away from what we are currently focusing on.</p> <p>A way I have come up to curb this problem is that whenever I come up with a new idea or inspiration, I will immediately <strong>capture them</strong> down on Roam.</p> <p>I keep quotes, reading highlights, podcast insights and everything you can think of. I find this very liberating as it helps to take the load off my brain so I can focus what is important presently.</p> <p>Then, at the end of the day, I can go back to review whatever I have written the entire day, and decide whether I will add them to the list of stuff to work on.</p> <h3 id="bookpodcastarticle-notes">📚Book/Podcast/Article Notes</h3> <p>This is the most obvious kind of note-taking: writing notes on stuff you read.</p> <p>Whenever I read, or other content I consume online e.g. podcasts, articles, I try my best to paraphrase and summarize every book. Especially when coming across a foreign concept that I wish to learn more on, I find it best to actively engage with the material for better learning.</p> <p>Take note <em>(pun intended)</em>: When taking notes, paraphrase and try not to refer back to the material at hand. This is the essence behind <em>Active Recall</em>.</p> <h3 id="️quantifying-my-productivity">⚖️Quantifying My Productivity</h3> <p>I subscribe to the notion of the <strong>1% Rule</strong>: if you improve yourself by 1% everyday for one year, you will end up 3800% better than where you started off a year ago. I first read this from James Clear, the author of the best-selling book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>.</p> <picture> <img src="https://www.ivan-ang.com/assets/marginal-gains.jpg" height="85%" width="85%"> <figure> <figcaption><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains">Marginal Gains</a> by James Clear. <br><i>"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement."</i></figcaption> </figure> </picture> <p>Of course, in reality, the metric to quantify your productivity is slightly more unclear, and you might not exactly be 38x better. But the 1% Rule proves how powerful compound interest can be and how it can do wonders to your life.</p> <p>I follow a simple system of quantifying my output to track my productivity. I have a section called <span>⏳Timeline of My Life</span>. In there, I record down the notable things that I have learnt or accomplished that day, or when I have reached a certain milestone in my life.</p> <p>This is especially useful if you wish to do <strong>weekly reviews</strong> on your personal development.</p> <p>Looking at all your past notes can give you a birds-eye view of what you have accomplished the entire week. By reviewing, you are applying <em>Spaced Repetition</em> to your learning. Occasionally looking back at the mini-achievements you have done can also do wonders to your motivation and self-esteem :P.</p> <p>I am considering using a software tool like <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> in the future to relegate this mini-project to. Maybe one day, I will reach the level of <a href="https://julian.digital/2020/02/23/my-quantified-self-setup/">julian.digital</a>.</p> <h3 id="journaling">📝Journaling</h3> <p>As mentioned in my article on journaling, I also use Roam as a tool for writing down my thoughts and reflections. You can read the article <a href="https://www.ivan-ang.com/journaling-as-a-tool-for-self-help/">here</a>, where I talk more about how I use it to manage my emotional and mental health.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>So this is a brief overview of the theories behind how I do my note-taking. I hope you have gained some insights after reading this post, and perhaps even incorporate some of these concepts into your own life.</p> <picture> <img src="https://www.ivan-ang.com/assets/my-roam-graph.png" height="95%" width="95%"> <figure> <figcaption><b>My Roam Graph:</b> An overview of how all my notes are …</figcaption></figure></picture></article></div>

    <p>Machine Learning (ML) is known as <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/">the high-interest credit card of technical debt</a>.
It is relatively easy to get started with a model that is good enough for a particular business problem, but to make that model work in a production environment that scales and can deal with messy, changing data semantics and relationships, and evolving schemas in an automated and reliable fashion, that is another matter altogether.
If you’re interested in learning more about a few well-known ML platforms, you’ve come to the right place!
<!--more--></p>

<p>As little as 5% of the actual code for machine learning production systems is the model itself.
What turns a collection of machine learning solutions into an end-to-end machine learning platform is an architecture that embraces technologies designed to speed up modelling, automate the deployment, and ensure scalability and reliability in production.
I talked about <a href="https://databaseline.tech/lean-dml-operations/">lean D/MLOps</a>, data and machine learning operations, before, because machine learning operations without data is pointless, so an end-to-end machine learning platform needs a holistic approach.</p>

<p>The CI/CD Foundation launched an <a href="https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/02/11/announcing-the-cd-foundation-mlops-sig/">MLOps Special Interest Group (SIG)</a>.
The steps they have identified for an end-to-end machine learning platform are shown in the next image:</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-cicd-mlops-sig.png" title="CI/CD Foundation MLOps"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-cicd-mlops-sig.png" alt="CI/CD Foundation MLOps" title="CI/CD Foundation MLOps"></a></p>

<p>It camouflages a few not-quite-insignificant details, though.
For instance, serving may require different technologies depending on whether it’s done in real-time or not.
Scalable solutions typically have the model inside a container that runs on many machines in a serving cluster that’s behind a load balancer.
So, a single box in the aforementioned diagram does not imply a single step, container, or component of an actual platform.
That’s not a critique of the picture, but a warning: what looks simple may not be quite as easy in practice yet.</p>

<p>Model (configuration) management is absent from the chart.
You can think of things such as versioning, experiment management, run-time statistics, data lineage tracking for training, test, and validation data sets, the capability to retrain a model, either from scratch or incrementally from, say, a snapshot of the model, hyperparameter values, accuracy metrics, and so on.</p>

<p>A crucial aspect that is not listed either is the ability to check the model for bias by, for example, slicing the model’s key performance metrics by different dimensions.
Many companies need the ability to hot-swap a model or run multiple in parallel, too.
The former is important lest a user’s request go into the void as it hits the server while the model is updated in the background.
And the latter is crucial for A/B testing or model validation.</p>

<p>Another perspective from CI/CD is available <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html">here</a>.
It mentions the need for versioning data as well as code, which is often overlooked.</p>

<h2 id="google-tfx">Google: TFX</h2>
<p>The main motivation behind Google’s development of <a href="https://databaseline.tech/a-tour-of-end-to-end-ml-platforms/(https://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/papers/view/tfx-a-tensorflow-based-production-scale-machine-learning-platform)">TensorFlow eXtended (TFX)</a> was to reduce the time to productionize a machine learning model from months to weeks.
Their engineers and scientists struggled because ‘the actual workflow becomes more complex when machine learning needs to be deployed in production.’</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-tfx.png" title="Google's TFX"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-tfx.png" alt="TensorFlow eXtended (TFX)" title="Google's TFX"></a></p>

<p>TensorFlow and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/">TFX</a> are available freely, although the latter is not as mature as the former, having been released only in 2019, two years after Google presented their ML infrastructure.</p>

<p>Model performance metrics are used to deploy safe-to-serve models.
So, if a newer model does not perform as well as an existing one, it is not pushed to production.
In TFX parlance, the model does not receive a ‘blessing’.
With TFX that whole process is automatic.</p>

<p>Here is a quick overview of open-source TFX components:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/examplegen.md">ExampleGen</a>
ingests and splits the input dataset.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/statsgen.md">StatisticsGen</a>
calculates statistics for the dataset.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/schemagen.md">SchemaGen</a>
examines the statistics and creates a data schema.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/exampleval.md">ExampleValidator</a>
looks for anomalies and missing values in the dataset.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/transform.md">Transform</a>
performs feature engineering on the dataset.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/trainer.md">Trainer</a>
trains the model using TensorFlow.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/evaluator.md">Evaluator</a>
analyses the training results.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/modelval.md">ModelValidator</a>
ensures that the model is safe to serve.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/docs/guide/pusher.md">Pusher</a>
deploys the model to a serving infrastructure.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/serving">TensorFlow Serving</a> is a C++ backend that serves a TensorFlow <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model#save_and_restore_models">SavedModel</a> file.</li>
</ul>

<p>To minimize training/serving skew, TensorFlow Transform ‘freezes’ values in the computation graph, so that the same values found during training are used when serving.
What may be several operations in the DAG when training will be a single fixed value at serving time.</p>

<h2 id="uber-michelangelo">Uber: Michelangelo</h2>
<p>Around 2015, Uber’s ML engineers noticed the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems">hidden technical debt in machine learning systems</a>, or the ML equivalent of ‘But it works on my machine…’
Uber had built custom, one-off systems that integrated with ML models, which was not very scalable in a large engineering organization.
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/">In their own words</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there were no systems in place to build reliable, uniform, and reproducible pipelines for creating and managing training and prediction data at scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s why they built Michelangelo.
It relies on Uber’s data lake of transactional and logged data, and it supports both offline (batch) and online (streaming) predictions.
For offline predictions containerized Spark jobs generate batch predictions, whereas for online deployments the model is served in a prediction service cluster, which typically consists of hundreds of machines behind a load balancer, to which clients send individual or batched prediction requests as RPCs.</p>

<p>Metadata relevant to model management (e.g. run-time statistics of the trainer, model configuration, lineage, distribution and relative importance of features, model evaluation metrics, standard evaluation charts, learned parameter values, and summary statistics) are stored for each experiment.</p>

<p>Michelangelo can deploy multiple models in the same serving container, which allows for safe transitions from old to new model versions and side-by-side A/B testing of models.</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-michelangelo-v1.png" title="Uber's Michelangelo: online vs offline"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-michelangelo-v1.png" alt="Uber's Michelangelo: online vs offline" title="Uber's Michelangelo: online vs offline"></a></p>

<p>The original incarnation of Michelangelo did not support deep learning’s need to train on GPUs, but that the team addressed that omission in the meantime.
The <a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-model-representation/">current platform</a> uses Spark’s ML pipeline serialization but with an additional interface for online serving that adds a single-example (online) scoring method that is both lightweight and capable of handling tight SLAs, for instance, for fraud detection and prevention.
It does so by bypassing the overhead of Spark SQL’s Catalyst optimizer.</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-michelangelo-v2.png" title="Uber's Michelangelo: training vs serving"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-michelangelo-v2.png" alt="Uber's Michelangelo: training vs serving" title="Uber's Michelangelo: training vs serving"></a></p>

<p>Noteworthy is that both Google and Uber built in-house protocol buffer parsers and representations for serving, avoiding bottlenecks present in the default implementation.</p>

<h2 id="airbnb-bighead">Airbnb: Bighead</h2>
<p>Airbnb established their own ML infrastructure team in 2016/2017 for similar reasons.
First, they only had a few models in production, but building each model could take up to three months.
Second, there was no consistency among models.
And third, there were large differences between online and offline predictions.
<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/databricks/bighead-airbnbs-endtoend-machine-learning-platform-with-krishna-puttaswamy-and-andrew-hoh">Bighead</a> is the culmination of their efforts:</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-bighead.png" title="Airbnb's Bighead"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-bighead.png" alt="Airbnb's Bighead" title="Airbnb's Bighead"></a></p>

<p>Data management is handled by the in-house tool Zipline.
Redspot is a hosted, containerized, multi-tenant Jupyter notebook service.
The Bighead library is for data transformations and pipeline abstractions, and it holds wrappers for common model frameworks.
It preserves metadata through transformations, so it is used to track lineage.</p>

<p>Deep Thought is a REST API for online predictions.
Kubernetes orchestrates the services.
For offline predictions, Airbnb use their own Automator.</p>


<p>Netflix faced, rather unsurprisingly, similar issues as the aforementioned companies.
Their solution was <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/open-sourcing-metaflow-a-human-centric-framework-for-data-science-fa72e04a5d9">Metaflow</a>, a Python library for data scientists that deals with <a href="https://blog.valohai.com/three-ways-to-categorize-machine-learning-platforms">data management and model training, and not so much prediction serving</a>.
As such it is <em>not</em> an end-to-end platform for machine learning, and perhaps more geared towards company-internal instead of user-facing use cases.
It can of course be turned into a fully-fledged solution with <a href="https://www.seldon.io/">Seldon</a>, which is backed by Kubernetes, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">AWS SageMaker</a>.
A list of further serving tools is available <a href="https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning#model-deployment-and-orchestration-frameworks">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-metaflow.png" title="Netflix' Metaflow"><img src="https://databaseline.tech/images/2020-02-21-ml-metaflow.png" alt="Netflix' Metaflow" title="Netflix' Metaflow"></a></p>

<p>Data scientists write their workflow as DAG steps, much like data engineers when they use Airflow.
And like Airflow, you can use any data science library because to Metaflow it’s only Python code that’s executed.
Metaflow distributes processing and training in the background.
All code and data is automatically snapshotted to S3 to ensure there is a version history of each model and experiment.
Pickle is the default model serialization format.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/">open-source edition</a> does not yet have a built-in <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/introduction/what-is-metaflow">scheduler</a>.
It also encourages users to ‘primarily rely on vertical scalability’, although they can use AWS SageMaker for horizontal scalability.
It is tightly coupled to AWS.</p>

<h2 id="lyft-flyte">Lyft: Flyte</h2>
<p>Lyft have open-sourced their cloud-native platform called <a href="https://flyte.org/">Flyte</a>, where data and machine learning operations <a href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/kccncna19/7f/Flyte%20Kubecon.pdf">converge</a>.
This is in line with my <a href="https://databaseline.tech/lean-dml-operations/">D/MLOps philosophy</a>—Data(Ops) is to MLOps as fuel is to a rocket: without it, ain’t nothin’ happenin’.</p>

<p>It is built on top of Kubernetes.
Since it is used internally by Lyft, it scales to at least 7,000 unique workflows with over 100,000 executions every month, 1 million tasks, and 10 million containers.</p>

<p>All entities in Flyte are immutable, so it is possible to track data lineage, reproduce of experiments, and roll back deployments.
Repeated tasks can leverage the task cache to save time and money.
Currently supported tasks include <a href="https://lyft.github.io/flyte/user/tasktypes/index.html">Python, Hive, Presto, and Spark</a> as well as <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/">sidecars</a>.
From looking at the source code it seems EKS is</p>

<p>Theirs is also <a href="https://github.com/lyft/amundsen">Amundsen</a>, a data catalogue that is not unlike Spotify’s <a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2020/02/27/how-we-improved-data-discovery-for-data-scientists-at-spotify/">Lexikon</a>.</p>

<h2 id="aws-azure-gcp-and-co">AWS, Azure, GCP, and Co.</h2>
<p>All major players in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/gartner-cloud-infrastructure-as-a-service/">public cloud</a> space have their own offerings for machine learning platforms, save for Oracle who only offer <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/products.html">canned ML-based models</a> for certain use cases and industries.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Simon’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to solve a contrived problem which is called Simon’s problem. Compared to one of the other quantum computing algorithms, <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, which only requires to run once, Simon’s algorithm requires to run the algorithm multiple times, yet it is still able to solve Simon’s problem exponentially faster asymptotically running on quantum circuits than the best conventional probabilistic algorithm running on classical circuits.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Simon’s problem and Simon’s algorithm in details.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="xor-properties">XOR Properties</h4>

<ul>
  <li><em>Commutativity</em>: $A \oplus B = B \oplus A$</li>
  <li><em>Associativity</em>: $A \oplus (B \oplus C) = (A \oplus B) \oplus C$</li>
  <li><em>Identity element</em>: $A \oplus 0 = A$</li>
  <li><em>Self-invertible</em>:  $A \oplus A = 0$</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reducing-sum-or-difference-to-boolean">Reducing Sum or Difference to Boolean</h4>

<p>If $x$ and $y$ are binary values, $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2). This could be easily verified using truth table.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space-for-binary-vector-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space for Binary Vector Space</h4>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">blog post</a>, we have defined the inner product and inner product space for complex vector space. Similarly, we could also define the inner product and inner product space for binary vector space.</p>



<p>Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$, the inner product of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as</p>



<p>which is somewhat similar to the inner product definition for real vector space.</p>



<p>The bitwise exclusive-or operation $\oplus$ was also defined for binary vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ of the same length. Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$,</p>



<p>The following inner product properties are satisfied based on the above inner product definition.</p>



<p>Given $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \in \{0,1\}^n$, using the $\text{XOR}$ distributivity property we derived above,</p>



<p>Similarly,</p>



<p>Let $\mathbf{0} = \{ \underbrace{0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{n} \} =  0^n$, we have</p>



<h4 id="hadamard-operator">Hadamard Operator</h4>

<p>Most of the important properties of Hadamard operator have been derived in the prerequisites section of my previous blog post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. Unlike Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon’s algorithm is only going to use a small fraction of the Hadamard operator properties that Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has used. I would just copy the properties useful for Simon’s algorithm algorithm. For the derivation, proof, and other properties of Hadamard operator, the reader should refer to my previous blog post.</p>



<p>To extract an arbitrary column $j$ from $H^{\otimes {n}}$, we prepared a one-hot quantum system basic state vector $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{2^n-1}]^{\top}$, where $y_j = 1$ and $y_k = 0$ for $k \neq j$.</p>



<p>where $| \mathbf{x}_i \rangle$ is a quantum system one-hot basic state vector,  $|\mathbf{x}_i\rangle = [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{2^{n}-1}]^{\top}$, where $x_i = 1$ and $x_k = 0$ for $k \neq i$.</p>



<p>Specifically, if $j = 0$, $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [\underbrace{1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{2^n} ]^{\top} = | \mathbf{0} \rangle$,</p>



<h3 id="simons-problem">Simon’s Problem</h3>

<p>Simon’s problem is defined as the follows. Given a black box function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$, we are further assured that there exists a hidden binary string $\mathbf{c} \in \{0,1\}^n$, such that, for all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$,</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is (bit-wise) $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2).</p>



<p>Our goal is to find out what $\mathbf{c}$ is.</p>

<h4 id="mapping-properties">Mapping Properties</h4>

<p>There are some properties of the mapping $f$. $f$ is either a one-to-one or two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a one-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ and $f$ is not a one-to-one mapping, there must exists $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{x}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a one-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a two-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, for any $\mathbf{x}$, we must have $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. So $f$ is at least a two-to-one mapping. Assuming there exists a tuple of $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, and $\mathbf{z}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$, $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{x}$, and $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y}) = f(\mathbf{z})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$. But $\mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}$ so we have $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{y}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a two-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="trivial-solution">Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Solving Simon’s problem could be trivial.</p>



<p>If we happen to know any $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{y}$. This is because,</p>



<p>If we have checked all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$ and found there are no $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>So the trivial solution for solving Simon’s problem is to evaluate $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one, and check if the newly evaluated valued has been shown in the previous evaluations.</p>

<h4 id="asymptotic-complexity-for-trivial-solution">Asymptotic Complexity for Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Using hashing, we should be able to check if the newly evaluated valued has been shown in the previous evaluations in $O(1)$. However, most of the computational cost comes from evaluating $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, if we are extremely lucky and the first two evaluated values $f(\mathbf{x}_0) = f(\mathbf{x}_1)$, then we are done and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x}_0 \oplus \mathbf{x}_1$. However, in the worst scenario, we would have to have evaluate $2^{n-1} + 1$ of the values in $\{0,1\}^n$.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, we would know it after evaluating $2^{n-1} + 1$ of the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ by realizing that there are no two evaluated values are the same.</p>



<p>Therefore, using the trivial solution, in the worst scenario, we would have to run the evaluation $2^{n-1} + 1$ times to determine the value of $\mathbf{c}$.</p>



<p>So the question is, can we do better?</p>

<h3 id="simons-algorithm">Simon’s Algorithm</h3>

<h4 id="design-quantum-circus">Design Quantum Circus</h4>

<p>Similar to the quantum gates we used for the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">Deutsch algorithm</a> and the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, the black-box $f(\mathbf{x})$ is represented using a quantum gate $U_f$.</p>

</div>

<p>The quantum gate $U_f$ is a unitary matrix which maps from $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | \mathbf{y} \rangle$ to $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle$, namely $U_f (| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | \mathbf{y} \rangle) = | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle$, for $\mathbf{x} \in \{0, 1\}^n$ and $\mathbf{y} \in \{0, 1\}^n$. When $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{0}$, $| f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{y} \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus \mathbf{0} \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle $, $| \mathbf{y} \oplus f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$ is just $| f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$.</p>



<p>Note that the above mapping is not necessarily valid when $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ and $| \mathbf{y} \rangle$ are superpositions.</p>



<p>Let’s further check if we could achieve fewer runs with superpositions and $U_f$.</p>



<p>We have the following quantum circus. Let’s compute the each of the quantum states in the circus. The mathematics is actually much easier compared to the ones in the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>.</p>

</div>









<p>Suppose $\mathbf{x}_2 = \mathbf{x}_1 \oplus \mathbf{c}$, and we also have $\mathbf{x}_1 = \mathbf{x}_2 \oplus \mathbf{c}$. Because</p>







<p>We could further rearrange $|\varphi_3\rangle $,</p>



<p>Note that $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle$ is a binary value. When $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle = 1$, $\sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \frac{(-1)^{\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x} \rangle} \big( 1 + (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c} \rangle} \big) }{2} = 0$, which means that for the top output qubits, we have exact zero probability of observing $\mathbf{z}$. We could only observe $\mathbf{z}$ whose $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c}\rangle  = 0$ for the top output qubits.</p>



<p>Statistically, when $\mathbf{c} = 0$, $\langle \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{c}\rangle  = 0$, for all $\mathbf{z} \in \{0,1\}^2$. This means all $\mathbf{z}$ are possible to be observed from the top output qubits. So what is the probability of observing $\mathbf{z}$, $p(\mathbf{z})$? Is it uniformly distributed?</p>





<p>Because $\mathbf{c} = 0$ and $f$ is an one-to-one mapping, we have</p>









<p>So when $\mathbf{c} = 0$, $p(\mathbf{z})$ is a uniform distribution and $p(\mathbf{z}) = \frac{1}{2^n}$.</p>



<p>How about when $\mathbf{c} \neq 0$?</p>





<p>Because $\mathbf{c} \neq 0$ and $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we …</p></div></div>

It has hurt the “aspirational professionals” by producing too many college graduates, leaving them to compete over a few high-paying high-status jobs in a few expensive cities. All while charging an arm and a leg that piles debt on them.</p><p>It has hurt everyone, with the exception of a few tenured literary critics who get increased status, and the CEOs of conglomerates, who get more resumes to choose from.</p><p><span id="more-1765"></span>Federalization is about imposing a dominant ideology and worldview, and in the case of our educational policy it is about imposing “front rowness”— the idea that everyone should aspire to becoming a tenured professor or a widget engaged in a resume arms race with the rest of the world.</p><p>It is a system built by intellectual elites who want everyone to be like them, and humiliates everyone else. It is a system that says anything that can’t be learned in an advanced placement class isn’t that important, like being a good member of the community, or family, or church. Those things are impediments to success. Staying home to care for your parents rather than rushing off to Princeton is an unnecessary speed bump on your way to having your best career!</p><p>Those who fundamentally don’t buy into this ideology, which is most of the working class, end up sitting in the back row of whatever school, distracted and frustrated. Throwing spitballs at whoever because they don’t take easily to set theory, or Algebra, or Henry James or Nathaniel Hawthorne. Because they don’t enjoy memorizing whatever they have to memorize for the next standardized test.</p><p>They are kids who just want to learn a skill to get a job. Because they are really good with their hands and good with tinkering, always have been. Or they are really good with animals, or good at getting stuff to grow, or they have ‘always been good at caring for people, noticing when someone is a little off and need to be checked on. Like, I always been good that way, especially with my Grandma, who shines up when she sees me come to play checkers. So maybe I will go into nursing you know. But I keep getting D’s in math and history, but if I can get over that hurdle, I sure would love to be a nurse.’</p><p>What we need is an educational system that values these kids’ particular world view, their particular skill set, their particular interests, and encourages and trains them in it. The back row kids who are not great at test taking and who don’t really want to go to college. So they can stay close to their parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, and eventually make a decent enough wage to buy a Tundra, a home, start a family, go to church, and eventually host the weekly backyard get togethers their cousins, aunts, uncles, nieces, friends come to. All without being sneered at as a dumb, uncurious, closed-minded provincial hick or hoodlum, because Shakespeare ain’t their thing.</p><p>Right now they are sneered at, directly and indirectly. The whole system is constantly probing, measuring, and gauging them. Constantly making them jump over one standardized hurdle after another, and sneering when they fall. So when they finally put it all behind them (thank god!), if they bother to focus on politics at all, they aren’t going to embrace the same group of people pushing the same policies that made them take test after test after test, while telling them their C’s and D’s were because they needed more self discipline, more curiosity, more openness, and more interest in the scientific method. You simple minded kid, vote for me!</p><p>Ahead of them, at the front of the classroom, are the clever curious kids who love running off to the library to read whatever and memorize whatever else. For twelve years they are in heaven because we have built a system for them, that embraces them, encourages them, and then whooshes them off to college, and then more college, and then even more college! But when they eventually emerge, maybe after graduating from 19th grade, they discover that although they were the best debater in Portsmouth, Ohio, and at Kenyon College, and one of the better thinkers in grad school, they are only the 75th best debater vying for that one job in Manhattan or that one tenure-track position at Columbia, and the poorest of the 200 people vying for that third-floor walk up in Williamsburg.</p><p>So the dream that everyone from their Head Start teacher to their high school guidance counselor, to their literary or intellectual hero on YouTube urged them to follow, of running off to see the world while making a difference, isn’t going so well, and now they are deep in debt from the last masters program that was supposed to make the difference and solve all of this.</p><p>Rightfully frustrated, they are now doing what they have been trained to do all their life, which is embracing politics and arguing, loudly and forcefully, to change the world. Which mostly means tinkering with the system that produced them, rather than tearing it all down. Because that is what they know.</p><p>So they focus their energies into making the system less painful, to them and their university friends. Like getting rid of college debt, or building more affordable apartments in Williamsburg, or providing more affordable public transportation because they take the damn subway every day and it is fucking crowded.</p><p>Some of them recognize that maybe we should throw fewer resources at education, maybe we should funnel fewer people into Philosophy PhD’s, and fewer young professionals into Williamsburg. Certainly their working class Brooklyn neighbors whose rent is skyrocketing agree with that.</p><p>These aspirational professionals running from one adjunct gig to the next have my complete sympathy, regardless of the policies they want changed, as do their back row counterparts running from one fast food gig to the next. Both have been chewed up and spit out by a system that chews up and spits out a lot of people. Just in different ways.</p><p><img src="https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1724-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="822" height="548" srcset="https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1724-300x200.jpg 300w, https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1724-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1724-768x513.jpg 768w, https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1724-1536x1025.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px"></p><p>Yet it is the kids sitting in middle row I have the deepest sympathy for because they are the most harmed, and the ones you hear the least about. They are mostly working class kids who don’t really fit into the back row because they are very disciplined, eager, and want do what they are told, and especially want to do the right thing. Which now means going off to college to better themselves, so they go off to college to better themselves, regardless of the cost.</p><p>They buy into our faux educational meritocracy the most, swallowing it hook, line, and sinker. They buy the dream peddled by every successful person they have ever run across or heard, from Obama down to the middle school guidance counselor: Education is the pathway to a successful and meaningful life.</p><p>So they work super hard to get A-’s and B+’s in their classes and 80’s on standardized tests, and then take the next step and go off to the the best college available.</p><p>But they don’t really fit into the front row either, because they don’t know anybody who has ever been to college. Not their parents, or grandparents, or uncles or aunts. Not even a cousin. But all of those relatives are encouraging, even giddy about the idea. They want the best for their child, so they help them apply, to the degree they can help. And when the acceptance letter comes from that far away college with ivy covered buildings (oh my god, real ivy, just like in the movies!), they are so happy they throw a party, complete with mylar balloons, and post the picture on Facebook or Instagram.</p><p>They are a little shocked when they see that the cost is like 40K a year, which is a super lot of money, more than dad makes, but mom makes some money too, and they will figure it out, because their wonderful child is going to have the American Dream.</p><p>So they apply for loans and eight years later that child is a young adult with 100K in debt working in a government bureaucracy five hundred miles away and missing the weekly family backyard BBQs .</p><p>Or maybe it didn’t work, and they are back home in the job they would have gotten straight out of high school, but now four years behind in seniority and 20K in debt.</p><p><img src="https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1200-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="838" height="558" srcset="https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1200-300x200.jpg 300w, https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1200-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://americancompass.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_1200-1536x1025.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px"></p><p>Education is wonderful, so is bettering yourself by getting as much of it as possible. But done on your terms and because you want it for your reasons. Not because you, your community, and everyone else you know, is competing with the Chinese, or the Germans, or the Indians. So you have to take countless standardized tests so you can win a golden ticket to ship off to Princeton and hang with others who are good at taking standardized tests, to then be taught more stuff, to then go to grad school to learn even more stuff, so you might, if you are lucky, get to go to San Francisco and live in an a small room hundreds of miles from your family to start in a firm trading bonds, or helping Google sue someone, or running from teaching one introductory writing course at one school to another introductory oratory course at another school, or maybe so you can write papers for a non-profit funded by a billionaire arguing that we need more education. That isn’t good.</p><p>What we have now is a top-down educational system that intellectually strip mines America and humiliates everyone. What we need is a democratic educational system that provides pathways to dignified lives for everyone. That provides Shakespeare and differential topology to those who see the beauty of each, but also provides skills to those who would rather focus on things like music, mechanics, nursing, parenting, farming, or whatever.</p><p>We need educational freedom, not educational colonialism.</p> <p><a href="https://americancompass.org/the-commons/">Return to the Commons</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al. (2013)</span> have since become a standard benchmark in Reinforcement Learning research. The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve.

        <h2 id="backstory-and-first-attempts">Backstory and first attempts</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post I’ve been working on reverse engineering the PLA chip in the C128.
I’m now mostly done with this process so I think it’s time to share some of the findings.</p>
<p>This has been a very interesting project as I did not really know much about semiconductor design
and manufacturing. My existing knowledge extended to having seen some die shots and admiring the pretty
looking pictures.</p>
<p>It all started with me buying a cheap microscope to help with soldering surface mount components.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/cheapo-microscope.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Cheap microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/cheapo-microscope.jpg" alt="Cheap microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>Some time later I ended up watching a video on youtube showing a simpler way of getting silicon dies out
of the packaging.</p>


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZQeHHYJYWXo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This looked simple enough to try at home as I already had all the equipment needed. Decapping an IC usually involves heated sulphuric acid or
other similar nasty chemicals which I do not really want to play with at home. So I dug out a couple of broken MOS chips I had lying around
(never throw things away, could come in handy). After fiddling around a bit I ended up with two 8521R0 dies and one 8721 PLA.
The first real photo was the one show in the last post.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/now-available/pla-die.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Full 8721 PLA die photo">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/now-available/pla-die.png" alt="Full 8721 PLA die photo">
</a>
</p>
<h2 id="better-microscope">Better microscope</h2>
<p>While this was a success I quickly realised that this microscope did not have enough resolution for me to be able to capture images of high
enough quality. The maximum magnification is 90x, when using a 2x barlow lens. Additionally it does not have a stage so I had to place the die
on a table and then move the whole microscope, which is very unstable and makes it hard to capture the bits you want to see.</p>
<p>As such a better microscope was sourced and purchased, still within reasonable money.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/amscope-me580t.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AmScope ME580-T microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/amscope-me580t.jpg" alt="AmScope ME580-T microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>This proved to be much better at taking pictures of decent quality, I was however not happy with the camera I bought with it. It’s a cheap camera with no capability for me to manage it remotely except using the AmScope application. Around this time, the Raspberry Pi foundation
released the new High Quality camera for the Raspberry Pi. This camera has a C-mount on it which matches the microscope so I quickly bought
one and put in on the microscope. This camera is fantastic for this job, full control of the whole process from the comfort of linux.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/8521r0-detail.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Silicon die detail from 8521R0">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/8521r0-detail.jpg" alt="Silicon die detail from 8521R0">
</a>
</p>
<p>All in all a vast improvement to the previous setup. With the higher resolution I started needing to stitch the photos together to make
larger pictures. This sounded simple at the start and ended up being (as you can probably guess) not very easy at all. I’m still struggling
with the stitching, but slowly improving. One of the key things for a successful panorama stitch is to have consistent photos when it comes
to panning, focus, white balance etc. etc. The more even the photos, the easier and better the stitching becomes.</p>
<h2 id="motorizing">Motorizing</h2>
<p>This led me to start working on motorizing the table. It was getting really tiresome having to manually move the table around and the photos
ended up being moved in multiple axis etc.</p>
<p>Lots of design work, 3D printing and research into CNC firmwares later I ended up with the following setup:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/modded-me580t.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Modified AmScope ME580-T microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/modded-me580t.jpg" alt="Modified AmScope ME580-T microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>Going from the top we have a Raspberry 7” display, with a Raspberry Pi4 mounted on the back. Not see is also the RPi HiQ camera mounted on
the microscope. The RPi takes photos, displays previews on the display and also runs the python code that controls the CNC board.</p>
<p>The stage and the levelling table is motorized with 28BYJ-48 steppers controlled using a small board with an ESP32 running <a href="https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32">Grbl_Esp32</a> and four AD4498 stepper motor controllers.</p>
<p>This whole setup has some issues both in software and hardware but it works well enough for now to enable me to do some work.</p>

<p>With the logistics now sorted out I returned to the work of reverse engineering the chip itself. My initial focus was on the PLA chip
as this should be one of the simpler ones to figure out. PLA stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_array">Programmable Logic Array</a> and is a very common structure in designs from this era.</p>
<p>Looking at the schematic diagram from wikipedia we should expect to see two main arrays, AND and OR. Inputs are connected to AND and
outputs from the OR array.</p>
<p>Going back to the previous die shot with can improve it with some annotations for the pins and the general areas of the chip. Once we
have established the pins we can see that all the inputs are connected to one array and all the outputs to the other array, just as
expected. This also helps us establish which array is which.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/pla-annotated.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Annotated die shot of 8721 PLA">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/pla-annotated.png" alt="Annotated die shot of 8721 PLA">
</a>
</p>
<p>Here we see the I/O pins marked up with how they are connected to the lead frame and the pins on the DIP itself. We can also see the two main
areas that make up a PLA structure, the AND array and the OR array. Additionally there is some extra logic at the bottom marked with a question
mark. The function of this was unknown to me but as all the output pins are passing through it I was guessing that it was an output stage of
some kind.</p>
<h2 id="and-array">AND array</h2>
<p>So, if we take a closer look at the AND matrix to start with we will see the following. The colours are a bit off as this was still done
using the AmScope camera and I didn’t figure out how to set the white balance on it.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-metal.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix with metal layer">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-metal.jpg" alt="AND matrix with metal layer">
</a>
</p>
<p>This was not very helpful to understand what was going on as all the interesting bits are covered up by the top-most metal layer. This was
early on when I was still learning a lot so to remove the metal I took a very brute force approach. I use heavy mechanical scrubbing to
remove the metal which I also learned once I put it back in the microscope had removed everything but the substrate itself. Oops.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the details that I needed were in the diffusion embedded into the substrate:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-delayer.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix substrate">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-delayer.jpg" alt="AND matrix substrate">
</a>
</p>
<p>Looking closely at this image we can see little squiggly lines where a transistor is located to create a connection within the matrix.</p>
<h2 id="or-array">OR array</h2>
<p>Moving on to the OR array we see the exact same pattern. Hard to tell with the metal layer in place, though easier compared to the AND
matrix. Much easier with just the substrate and diffusion left.</p>


<h2 id="full-matrix-decode">Full matrix decode</h2>
<p>Armed with this knowledge we can now proceed with extracting the full PLA logic matrix from the images.</p>
<p>I marked all transistors in each matrix with a dot and got the following picture:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/decoded-matrix.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix with metal layer">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/decoded-matrix.jpg" alt="AND matrix with metal layer">
</a>
</p>
<p>All inputs are horizontal in the AND matrix, with each line having a normal and an inverted signal being fed in.
All outputs are horizontal in the OR matrix and they are connected with vertical lines called product terms.</p>
<p>By looking at the dots, we can decode the product terms by doing logic and for all vertical lines in the AND matrix, for example</p>
<pre><code>    p0 = CHAREN &amp; HIRAM &amp; BA &amp; !MS3 &amp; GAME &amp; RW &amp; AEC &amp; A12 &amp; !A13 &amp; A14 &amp; A15
</code></pre><p>For the outputs we instead look horizontal for each output and combine with or, for example</p>
<pre><code>    SDEN = p42 | p43 | p66 | p69
</code></pre><p>So now we have the entire set of logic equations. Hooray!</p>
<h2 id="output-stage">Output stage</h2>
<p>Going back to the full die picture, we now have everything but the box marked with a question mark in the output path.</p>
<p>Looking at higher resolution photos of this we can see similar structures for each output. In all cases except two the structure
is bypassed and the output from the OR matrix goes directly to the output pin. This is however not the case for the two pins <code>DWE</code> and <code>CASENB</code>.</p>
<p><code>DWE</code> is the Write Enable signal going to the main system DRAM chips, CASENB is gating the CAS signal towards the RAM. These two signals are
processed in some form using these output gate structures, so I had to reverse engineer this block.</p>


<p>After quite some time reading up on silicon chip design and manufacturing and a lot of attempts I managed to come up with a schematic
for this that makes sense. I’m not going to go into the whole process here but I will document and post it later. Here I would also like
to thank <a href="https://www.patreon.com/androSID">Frank Wolf</a> for his help, please support his project if you can!</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/output-schematic.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Output block schematic">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/output-schematic.png" alt="Output block schematic">
</a>
</p>
<p>Going a bit further, the way this is used in the <code>DWE</code> and <code>CASENB</code> outputs makes it a normal D-latch. The latch enable for this also comes
for the PLA matrix in a pair of lines in the OR matrix.</p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>So as a final result we can now write down the full HDL code for the C128 PLA chip. I’m using verilog for this. Mind you this is the first
verilog I’ve ever written so it’s probably suboptimal. Using a D-latch for the output in verilog is normally seen as a bad thing, however
in this case I am doing it to replicate the logic and function of the existing chip.</p>
<p>I have validated this to the best of my knowledge, but if I’ve missed anything please let me know!</p>
<p>In difference to the C64 PLA the C128 PLA can not be replaced with just an EPROM or similar due to the presence of the output latches.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>“The only apps that are subject to a commission are those where the developer acquires a customer on an Apple device and where the features or services would be experienced and consumed on an Apple device,” Cook states. </p><p>Cook references <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-releases-study-to-justify-app-store-business-model/">a study it commissioned and released last week</a> that compared Apple App Store’s commissions with cuts taken by Google Play Store, Amazon App Store, Samsung Galaxy Store, and Microsoft Store, as well as marketplaces from Airbnb, Uber, and Epic Games.  </p><p>The study concluded that Apple’s guidelines for in-app purchases are necessary to prevent users and developers from ‘free-riding’ on the App Store and that all digital marketplaces “routinely forbid behaviors aimed at avoiding fees”. </p><cite><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tim-cook-defends-app-store-if-apple-is-a-gatekeeper-we-just-opened-the-gate-wider/" target="_blank">ZDNet</a>  – July 29 2020</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Apple makes the argument that developers should have to pay for the running of the App Store, but it’s not the largest developers using by  far the most App Store resources who are paying.</p>



<p>Apps by Facebook surely account for some huge percentage of all downloads on the entire App Store. Facebook pays just $99 per year for this service.</p>



<p>Google – $99 per year. Amazon – $99 per year + a special deal for video that no one else gets.  Netflix – $99 per year.</p>



<p>Funny how small developers have to pay 30/15%, and have no way to work around it, but there’s exceptions everywhere for other monopolies and mega-corporations.</p>



<p>“The only apps that are subject to a commission are those where the developer acquires a customer on an Apple device and where the features or services would be experienced and consumed on an Apple device” says Tim Cook. </p>



<p>Tim, how is it possible given todays rules for a small developer to write an app where the developer could prove that they did not “acquire the customer on an Apple device” but instead acquired them via advertising the developer had to pay for (e.g. ads on Google, or via their own website) and therefor should not pay 30%? I’d like to see the steps on how to do that.</p>



<p><em>Note to non-technical audience members: Apple is not providing some kind of amazing technical service here. If you build and distribute an app via the App Store that sells a t-shirt instead of a digital photo you don’t have to use Apple payments and you don’t pay 30%. They have just drawn a line in the sand where they want it to be.</em></p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Using Python, we want to convert words to numbers. In this challenge, we will explore how to convert a string into an integer.</p>
<p>The strings simply represent the numbers in words.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<ul><li>“one” =&gt; 1</li><li>“twenty” =&gt; 20</li><li>“two hundred forty-six” =&gt; 246</li><li>“seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen” =&gt; 783919</li></ul>
<h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
<ul><li>The minimum number is “zero” (inclusively)</li><li>The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)</li><li>The “and” in e.g. “one hundred and twenty-four” is optional, in some cases it’s present and in others, it’s not</li><li>All tested numbers are valid, you don’t need to validate them</li></ul>
<h2>Test cases</h2>
<pre title="">Test.assert_equals(parse_int('one'), 1)
Test.assert_equals(parse_int('twenty'), 20)
Test.assert_equals(parse_int('two hundred forty-six'), 246)
</pre>
<h2>The solution in Python</h2>
<pre title="">def parse_int(textnum, numwords={}):
    # create our default word-lists
    if not numwords:

      # singles
      units = [
        "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight",
        "nine", "ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen",
        "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen",
      ]

      # tens
      tens = ["", "", "twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety"]

      # larger scales
      scales = ["hundred", "thousand", "million", "billion", "trillion"]

      # divisors
      numwords["and"] = (1, 0)

      # perform our loops and start the swap
      for idx, word in enumerate(units):    numwords[word] = (1, idx)
      for idx, word in enumerate(tens):     numwords[word] = (1, idx * 10)
      for idx, word in enumerate(scales):   numwords[word] = (10 ** (idx * 3 or 2), 0)

    # primary loop
    current = result = 0
    # loop while splitting to break into individual words
    for word in textnum.replace("-"," ").split():
        # if problem then fail-safe
        if word not in numwords:
          raise Exception("Illegal word: " + word)

        # use the index by the multiplier
        scale, increment = numwords[word]
        current = current * scale + increment
        
        # if larger than 100 then push for a round 2
        if scale &gt; 100:
            result += current
            current = 0

    # return the result plus the current
    return result + current
</pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>July 30, 2020</p></header><section><p>In general, prefer having technical conversations in a public forum, such as a
public team Slack channel, Google Doc comment or a GitHub pull request comment
thread.</p>
<p>This applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.larah.me/asking-for-help-on-slack">asking the onpoint a technical question</a> (<em>this one in particular!</em>)</li>
<li>asking your code reviewer about something they commented in a Pull Request</li>
<li>talking with coworkers to decide a technical approach for something</li>
<li>a conversation started in a google doc for scoping a project</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of a <em>private</em> Slack chat, consider having the conversation in the
same forum that the question first came up (the team slack channel, Google Doc
or Pull Request).</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Public forums let others weigh in.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not unlikely that someone else on the team has an opinion or knows the
answer.</li>
<li>You might get an answer from someone else quicker!</li>
<li>Asking the question where others can see it leads to more knowledge sharing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private channels are private.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no searchable paper trail for future teammates to refer back to
later about the surrounding context in which a decision was made.</li>
<li>(Yes this is also true of equivalent in-person meetings, but that’s a
seperate blog post for another day)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private Slack channel message history may be ephemeral by default.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on your Slack plan - you might have to remember to set the private
slack thread message history beyond some default. Otherwise the message
history and context may get deleted after some time!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What should I do if someone DMs me a technical question anyway?</h2>
<p>Don’t be afraid to gently respond something like “hey, let’s take this back to
&lt;team channel&gt; so others can weigh in!” and move the conversation over.</p>
<p>(Or feel free to link to this post for the motivation and let me be the killjoy
:P)</p></section><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.larah.me%2Fprefer-having-discussions-in-public%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discuss on Twitter</a> • <a href="https://github.com/magicmark/blog.larah.me/edit/master/content/blog/prefer-having-discussions-in-public/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit on GitHub</a></p><hr></article></div>]]>
