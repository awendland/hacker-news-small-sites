<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Hey team,</p>

<p>This is the continuation (and end) of the <em>Language(s) of Science</em> series that we started <a href="https://languagetools.io/forum/t/3191" target="_blank">here</a>. It's a long one, so let's dive right into it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/b6P7x4S/Part-II.png"></p><h3>English is the language of science</h3>
<p>Today, English is the dominant language of science. There are many factors - political, economic, social, or regulatory - that help explain this phenomenon. The geopolitical dominance of the British Empire and then of the United States in the last few centuries gave the language a head-start, and a momentum. Rich English-speaking countries are some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_scientific_and_technical_journal_articles" target="_blank">most prolific</a> in terms of scientific output. The quasi-totality of the <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?type=j" target="_blank">most influential scientific journals</a> are English-language, and an <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-five-companies-control-more-than-half-of-academic-publishing" target="_blank">oligopolistic academic publishing sector</a> reinforces a monolingual scientific communication. English might be the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/most-popular-languages-in-the-world.html" target="_blank">most widely spoken language</a> in the world, at more than 1 billion people. The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish" target="_blank">publish or perish</a>" culture, where funding and tenure are conditional on publication performance above all else, and the incentive systems that result from this lead scientists to write in the language that will increase the likelihood of the article getting published, reaching a large readership, and garnering citations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intentionally or not, the whole system seems to be clamouring for English to be <em>the</em> language in which science is done.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>The two sides of the mirror</h3>
<p>The existence of a <em>lingua franca</em> in science has undeniable advantages. It removes all linguistic barriers – except one – to communicating and accessing scientific developments the world over. It underpins the internationalisation of universities, which broadens the education and career prospects of students and professors worldwide. It further standardizes the production of knowledge, which facilitates organization of and access to knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The factors listed above, be they implicit or explicit, could be described as high-level characteristics of the global system we inhabit, only tenuously related to science. However, as desirable as the resulting advantages are, their corollaries are no less hypothetical, if much less researched.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>Large scale effects...</h3>
<p>A bird-eye look at the dominance of English yields some striking insights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the scientific field, and the data one looks at, <a href="https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/leap.1089" target="_blank">up to 97% of scholarly publication</a> can be in English, with hard sciences being more monolingual than humanities. Even in countries with a large scientific output, articles are written in English-only, and <a href="https://www.researchtrends.com/issue-31-november-2012/the-language-of-future-scientific-communication/" target="_blank">increasingly so</a>. Journals that used to be plurilingual are increasingly <a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2016/05/10/the-adoption-of-english-among-scielo-brazil-journals-has-been-increasing/" target="_blank">becoming English-only</a>. Non-English-language journals are further hidden from view by their <a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2015/08/02/motion-to-repudiate-mr-jeffrey-bealls-classist-attack-on-scielo/" target="_blank">exclusion from leading journal indexes</a>. Scientific terminology often remains confined to English, making other languages potentially <a href="http://lcn.pascalobservatory.org/sites/default/files/joe_lo_bianco_-_language_place_and_learning_-_august_2007.pdf" target="_blank">inadequate for doing science</a>. The assumption that <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/english-language-science-can-cause-problems-180961623/" target="_blank">all important information is in English</a> biases understanding of science (the flu virus H5N1, which could have been a major pandemic, famously <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/430955a" target="_blank">went unnoticed for months</a> because it was first reported in Chinese, not in English).&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a time where science is suffering from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis" target="_blank">replication crisis</a> and a crisis of trust, it is desirable to facilitate discussion around each and every publication, and few languages have more speakers than English. But then again, a monolingual research produced for an exclusive (if heterogeneous) readership provides for little diversity in terms of perspective, and the perverse outcomes of an English-only science weaken the local nature of research communities and remove research cultures from the very contexts that nurtured them.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>...and their individual underpinnings</h3>
<p>English is so <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2018/03/13/domination-english-language-journal-publishing-hurting-scholarship-many-countries" target="_blank">deeply ingrained</a> in the metrics of science that it is more a requirement than a choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the costs of translation services are prohibitively high for most scientists, few of them can afford to produce two versions of their paper, so they often choose to write in English only. This includes humanities: researchers who are interested in fundamentally local topics (the Quechua language, or Bantu traditions, or Spanish history) are increasingly compelled to publish their work in English. Those scientists who can afford producing their papers both in English and their local language need to contend with bans on dual publication enforced by most journals, which forbid papers to be republished elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This situation is also profoundly unfair, because <a href="http://www.teljournal.org/article_66109_85c526124faf5bde548ad8bf65cf9eb3.pdf" target="_blank">proficiency in English is not evenly distributed and is dependent on socioeconomic status</a>: an English-only science provides a massive advantage to those who have English as their first language, or who have been able to access high-quality education in English.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And this disadvantage has a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/08/english-universal-language-science-research/400919/" target="_blank">compound effect</a>. Those with a poorer level of English are less likely to choose to study science, are more likely to lag behind, take longer to process their English-language material, incur more costs and take longer to produce research, are refused publication because of language mistakes, are more likely to face prejudice because of their poorer writing, are less likely to have good metrics and get funding, can even get snubbed in favor of their Anglophone collaborators in media. The list goes on. The effect is that less people do science, and a large majority of scientists work in a language they're less confident in, while those who choose to work in a language other than English have trouble making themselves visible.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>Potential solutions</h3>
<p>An English-first science <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/23682/1/Current-socio-published-non-Sage-format.pdf" target="_blank">impedes the development of national and regional research communities and cultures</a>, limits both the quantity and quality of research, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/english-language-science-can-cause-problems-180961623/" target="_blank">allows loss of knowledge</a>, and reduces science's diversity. While the final balance is unclear, it is undeniable that global research does not only stand to gain from a <em>lingua franca</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the criticisms presented here, the dominance of English in science is unlikely to be imperilled in the foreseeable future, because too many feedback loops within the systems that science exists in buttress this supremacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, some mechanisms push back against this, directly or indirectly. Open-access journals, which are becoming increasingly commonplace, have <a href="https://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access/pros-and-cons" target="_blank">many advantages</a> over traditional journals and these qualities indirectly make the existence of non-English journals more viable. Machine translation, while still being inadequate for translating complex academic language, is constantly improving and lowering translation costs. Some of the largest journal indexes have started accepting non-English-language journals, and non-English indexes (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciELO" target="_blank">SciELO</a>) are gaining ground, which in turn fuels their advocacy for a more diverse science.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But further efforts, big and small, are required. While there has not been enough discussion to identify what these could be, existing literature seems to converge on some ideas. National policies that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000933" target="_blank">financially support scientists to learn English, translate their work, and publish it</a> could strengthen national, and global, research. Dual publishing bans, which benefit journals at the expense of the community at large, need to be regulated away. Anglophone journals should make efforts to welcome multilingual research, and the metrics that scientists are evaluated against need to decouple themselves from English. The negative effects of an English-first science need to be more thoroughly researched. Finally, the <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-10-english-lingua-franca-science.html" target="_blank">individual experiences</a> of those who have had to abandon science, who struggle against a system geared against them, experiences that are deeply human, harrowing, and relatable, need to become a focus of popular science writing, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/peru-student-roxana-quispe-collantes-thesis-inca-language-quechua" target="_blank">achievements</a> need to be celebrated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To quote <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/does-english-have-to-be-the-dominant-language-of-science/" target="_blank">another article</a>: "<em>The language we use when we speak science is as important as any other part in a methods section and should be deliberate and fair.</em>"</p>

November 22, 2020 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/israeli-queues | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/israeli-queues">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A queue is a data structure that holds up elements for a brief period of time until a peripheral processing system is ready to process them. The most common implementation of a queue is a FIFO queue - First In First Out - that evicts the element that was inserted the first i.e. it evicts the one that has spent the most time in the queue. There are other variations of Queues one of which is called Priority Queue.</p>
<p>In Priority Queue, every element is associated with a priority, usually provided by the user during enqueueing; This associated priority is used during eviction where the element with the highest priority is evicted first during dequeuing.</p>
<p>In this essay, we take a detailed look into a variation of Priority Queue, fondly called Israeli Queues, where the priority of the element is defined by the affinity of it with one of its "friends" in the queue. Israeli Queues were first introduced in the paper <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2152975/632939.pdf">Polling with batch service</a> by Boxma, O. J., Wal, van der, J., &amp; Yechiali, U in the year 2007.</p>

<p>Queues in Israel are usually unorganized, due to which people tend to find their friends, who are already waiting, and instead of adhering to the usual protocol of joining at the back end, they cut through and directly join their friends. Israeli Queues mimic this behavior and hence get this <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15326340802427497">punny name</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99894937-fddc4380-2cac-11eb-8a73-a4dc5c490d2b.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99894937-fddc4380-2cac-11eb-8a73-a4dc5c490d2b.png"></p>
<p>Israeli Queues are a variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue">Priority Queues</a> where instead of associating priority with the element to be enqueued, the priority is implicitly derived using the "friend" element and it joins right at the back end of the group that the friend belongs to. The function signature of the enqueue operation is as shown below, while other operations like <code>dequeue</code> and <code>peek</code> remains fairly similar.</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>void</span> <span>enqueue</span><span>(israeli_queue * q, element * e, element * f)</span></span>;
</code></pre>
<h2>How could this help?</h2>
<p>Every Data Structures is designed to solve a niche use case efficiently and Israeli Queues are no different as they prove to be super-efficient where one could batch and process similar elements or where the <em>set-up</em> cost for a task is high.</p>
<p>Consider a system where a queue is used to hold up heterogeneous tasks and there is a single machine taking care of processing. Now if some of these tasks are similar and have a high <em>set-up or preparation cost</em>, for example downloading large metafiles, or spinning up a parallel infrastructure, or even setting up persistent connections with device farms, queuing them closer and processing them sequentially or in batch helps in reducing redundant processing and computation by promoting reuse.</p>
<h2>Issue of starvation</h2>
<p>By enqueuing elements in between Israeli Queues reduces redundant processing, but by doing that it makes itself vulnerable to the classical case of starvation. Elements stuck at the rear end of the list could potentially starve for longer durations if elements having "friends" in the queue keep coming in at high frequency.</p>
<p>The original implementation of Israeli Queues suggests batch processing where instead of processing tasks one at a time, it processes a batch (a group of friends) in one go. This proves to be super-handy when the time required to processes a single task is much lower than the set-up cost for it.</p>
<h2>Implementation Guidelines</h2>
<p>The best way to implement Israeli Queues is by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked List</a> with a bunch of pointers pointing to the head and tail of groups within it. Insertion to an existing group happens at the tail of it while if the element has no friend element, then it goes at the tail end of the list and forms its own group.</p>
<p>A constraint that could be added during implementation is that the friend element should always be the leader (head) element of the group. Details of the implementation could be tweaked so long the core concept remains unaltered.</p>

<p>Israeli Queues were the outcome of a problem statement dealing with Polling Systems. Polling System usually contains <code>N</code> queues <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code> where the processing unit visits each queue in cyclic order processing one element at a time i.e. <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code>, <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code>, etc.</p>
<p>When the server attends a queue instead of processing just one element from it, it processes the entire batch present in the queue utilizing the setup-cost efficiently assuming that time to process an element from a queue is much lesser than the set-up cost.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that applications duplicate operating system's functionality.
How severe issue is it and what kind of consequences there are?</p>
<p><a href="https://gottcode.org/kapow/">Kapow punch clock</a> tracks hours and constructs reports.
Its author has done well in maintaining complexity.
The whole program is only 4171 lines (+594 lines of copyright headers),
with total 146kB of source code.
This post presents a program for Plan 9 that serves the same purpose.
Finally lets do some comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="kapow screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/kapow.png"></p>
<p>The source code presented is attached: <a href="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.zip">task.zip</a></p>
<h2>task entries</h2>
<p>The clock has this kind of a nice directory -tab.
I have seen this tool being used.
The tabs were used to track customer_project_day instead of projects.
The dialog looks like a file browser.</p>
<p>The 'task' program treats each task as a file.
For instance here's the '0.kapow.task'.</p>
<pre><code>Punch clock port experiment
</code><code>start: Sat Nov 21 11:00:06 GMT 2020</code></pre>
<p>This is a running task.
When I'm done, I append in the stop: -line.</p>
<p>The time stamps aren't using Finnish abbreviations for weekdays or months
and it is bit inconvenient for me.
Though they are slightly more convenient than unix timestamps
because I can type the hour there if I forget to mark it.</p>
<p>The system benefits from not needing a locale to parse dates.
If you don't like english dates, you can use ISO-8601 timestamps,
those should work as well and look like this:</p>
<pre><code>2020-11-21T20:16:49+00:00</code></pre>
<h2>task/start and task/stop</h2>
<p>To start a task you write a timestamp into a file and mark it to start the task.
Although it'd be easy to do it manually,
I add few convenience scripts so you don't lose an entry
just because you write &gt; instead of &gt;&gt;.
Here's task/start and task/stop.
They are used to mark a task completed or start a task.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo start: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }
</code><code>
</code><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo stop: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }</code></pre>
<p>You can consider these are up to you to configure,
they're for your convenience.</p>
<h2>task/span</h2>
<p>Next you need a tool to know task status. Here's the 'task/span':</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>if (~ $#* 1) {
</code><code>  if (test -f $1) {
</code><code>    rfork e
</code><code>    taskname=$1
</code><code>    start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    if (~ $stop '') stop=`{date | xargs seconds}
</code><code>
</code><code>    dt=`{echo print $stop(1) - $start(1) | bc}
</code><code>    s=`{echo print $dt % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    m=`{echo print $dt / 60 % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    h=`{echo print $dt / 3600 | bc}
</code><code>    echo span: $h hours $m minutes $s seconds
</code><code>    }
</code><code>  if not { echo not a file: $1&gt;[1=2]; exit usage }
</code><code>  }
</code><code>if not { echo usage: $0 taskfile &gt;[1=2]; exit usage }</code></pre>
<p>It presents how many hours, minutes, seconds have been spent in the task.
If the task is still running, it uses the current time as range.</p>
<h2>task/report</h2>
<p>The 'task/report' sorts the tasks and builds a report out of them.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>tasks=`{for (t in $*) {
</code><code>  p=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' $t | xargs seconds}
</code><code>  echo $p $t } | sort -n | awk '{ print $2 }'}
</code><code>
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  span=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$3,$4,$5 }'}
</code><code>  start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  if (~ $stop '') { echo $span $start '*' }
</code><code>  if not { echo $span $start }
</code><code>  sed '/^start:|^stop:/d' $taskname | sed 's/^/  /g'
</code><code>  }
</code><code>
</code><code>total=0
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  d=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$4 }'}
</code><code>  total=`{echo print $total + ($d(1) '*' 60) + $d(2) | bc}
</code><code>}
</code><code>echo total: `{echo print $total / 60 | bc} hours `{echo print $total % 60 | bc} minutes</code></pre>
<p>When a task is ongoing, this utility shows a star on it's entry.
This script could be customized for different uses.
Right now it's a plaintext report.</p>
<h2>display</h2>
<p>Some people like to have a display that tracks what is going on.
The 'task/track' -script executes a command periodically every minute
and the window where it runs is cleaned every time it repeats.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>while (sleep 60) task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt; /dev/text</code></pre>
<p>It again is merely a convenience.
All of this functionality composes with rest of what the system has to offer.
For instance if you want to see all tasks in some directory:</p>
<pre><code>while (sleep 1) {
</code><code>    echo -n &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>    for (x in *.task) {
</code><code>        echo -n $x: ' '
</code><code>        task/span $x }}</code></pre>
<p>Also here's a cool thing,
if you want completed task list to appear when you log into your terminal,
you can add this into the rio start script:</p>
<pre><code>window -r 2338 15 2853 345 task/track 'echo *.task'</code></pre>
<p>Ok, we're done now. Here's how the finished program looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="task screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.png"></p>
<h2>tally</h2>
<p>The whole program suite is 48 lines and 1.5kB.</p>
<pre><code>cpu% wc bin/rc/task/*
</code><code> 21     119     703 bin/rc/task/report
</code><code> 18     100     578 bin/rc/task/span
</code><code>  3      11      73 bin/rc/task/start
</code><code>  3      11      72 bin/rc/task/stop
</code><code>  3      15     100 bin/rc/task/track
</code><code> 48     256    1526 total</code></pre>
<p>This is about 85 times less than kapow punch clock.</p>
<h2>apples and oranges?</h2>
<p>It may seem the comparison is unfair.
Are the programs equivalent in functionality?
The answer is no.
The 'task' implements much less functionality than the kapow punch clock.
It's barely considered bunch of scripts.
However the tasks are merely files and you edit them with existing tools,
this thing introduces very little to learn.
The manual is 1kB and I think I made it verbose.
Yet despite that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're able to search from your tasks.</li>
<li>Exporting/Importing of tasks is easy because they are files
and to use the program you have to know where they are.</li>
<li>Tasks can be interleaved with other contents on the system.</li>
<li>Tasks archive properly given your other files archive properly.</li>
<li>You can attach and receive tasks in the mail.</li>
<li>The status of the tasklist can be securely live-displayed
on a remote info board and shared with collaborators.</li>
<li>There are lots of customization options.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do wonder what the take-away from here is.
Despite this all, kapow punch clock, it's fine software.
I don't mind that it's been written.</p>
<h2>experiences</h2>
<p>I did this to try off this 'rc' and try to write a manual page.
I'm surprised how usable the 'troff' is once you don't assume it should be something familiar.
The 'rc' is equally incredible by having an actual structure that you can rely on.
Plan 9 is such an incredibly good operating system,
I constantly find things that surprise in a good way.</p>

<p>Hi, folks!</p>
<p>Every single program allocates memory. Byte buffers are at the core of many essential libraries which power the services the modern internet is built upon. If you’re building such a library, or even just copying data between different files, chances are you’ll need to allocate a buffer.</p>
<p>In Java, <code>ByteBuffer</code> is the class that allows you to do so. Once you’ve decided to allocate a buffer, you’ll be presented with two methods <code>allocate()</code> and <code>allocateDirect()</code>. Which one to use? The answer is, as always, it depends. If there were no tradeoffs, there wouldn’t be two methods. In this article, I’ll explore some of these tradeoffs, demystify this behaviour, and I hope that the answer will be clear for you by the end of it.</p>

<p>Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don’t matter right now. Sometimes they matter later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_two_buffers">Two buffers</h3>
<p>At first glance, the two methods <code>allocate()</code> and <code>allocateDirect()</code> are very simple. The <code>allocate()</code> allocates a buffer in the managed heap of the Java process, a part of this exact space which size is specified with the <code>Xmx</code> option. The <code>allocateDirect()</code> method allocates a buffer residing outside of the managed heap.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/server3.png" alt="server3"></span></p>
<p>This difference, however, creates a number of significant runtime implications, which I’m going to dive into here. But first, let me start by telling a debugging story where direct byte buffers were the murderer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_story">The story</h3>
<p>Every story needs a protagonist. In this case, the protagonist was a Java application built on top of RSocket, a modern application protocol. Here’s the oversimplified version of the app which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/blob/master/src/main/java/me/serce/allocatedirect/Main.java">Github</a>. Let’s call this app an echo app. The echo code isn’t trying to do anything complicated, it is a simple echo service built with an awesome <a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java">rsocket-java</a> library. All it does is spins up a client and a server, where the client sends messages, and the server echoes them back.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">var server = RSocketServer.create(echo) //...
var client = RSocketConnector.create() //...
while (true) {
  assert Objects.equals(client.send(), client.receive())
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
The supporting code for this article is available <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect">on Github</a>. You can, and I highly encourage you to, choose to go through each step yourself by cloning the code and running each example with a simple bash script. All measurements were taken on an EC2 AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/">m5.large</a> instance. Unless specified otherwise, <em>Java 13</em> is used. The point of this article is not to show the numbers but rather demonstrate the techniques that you can use to debug your own application.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The code is useless if it’s just sitting in the repo and doing nothing, so let’s clone the repo and start the app.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect.git
cd allocatedirect &amp;&amp; ./start.sh</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The app starts, and you should see that the logs are flowing. As expected, now it’s processing a large number of messages. However, if the echo app was exposed to users, they would start noticing significant pauses every now and then. All Java developers know that the first thing to look at in the case of spurious pauses is GC.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
You can find GC logs of the app are stored in <code>/tmp/${gcname}</code>. The example logs for each run are also available in the <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/tree/master/logs">repo</a>. In this article, gceasy.io was used for visualisation. It’s a great free online tool which supports the log format of multiple garbage collectors. Even though you can always visualise GC logs using a tool like gceasy, as we’ll see later, the raw logs often contain a lot more information than most of the tools can display.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Indeed, GC logs show that GC is to blame here. The application is running under G1, which is the default collector since JDK 9. There are multiple young GC pauses on the graph. Young GC is a stop-the-world pause in GC in G1. The application stops completely to perform a cleanup. For the echo server, the graph shows multiple young GC pauses that last for 100-130ms and occur every 10 seconds.</p>
<div>
<p>G1 GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/g1before.png" alt="g1before"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Luckily for us, in the last few years, there has been an amazing development in the GC space. There are not just one but two new fully concurrent garbage collectors, <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/zgc/Main">ZGC</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/shenandoah/Main">Shenandoah</a>.</p>
<p>While I’ve had <a href="https://twitter.com/SerCeMan/status/1246676501925224449">great success</a> with ZGC before, Shenandoah has a great advantage of being much friendlier to application memory consumption. Many applications, especially simple JSON in, JSON out stateless services are not memory-constrained. Some application, on the other hand, especially the ones that process a large number of connections might be very sensitive to memory usage.</p>
<p>Even though the echo app only has a single client and a server in its current state, it could as well handle tens of thousands of connections. It’s time to enable Shenandoah, and run the echo app again.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">./start.sh shen # starts with -XX:+UseShenandoahGC</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>After enabling Shenandoah, the GC logs start showing an interesting picture. There is definitely a huge improvement in the pause frequency. The pauses now only occur every minute or so. However, the pauses are still around 90ms long, which is far away from the desired sub-millisecond pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>Shenandoah GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/shenandoah.png" alt="shenandoah"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Now that the symptoms are clear, and the problem is reproducible, it’s time to look at the cause. GC graphs don’t show much more information. Looking at the raw logs directly, on the other hand, reveals the cause which is clearly stated right on the pause line.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="log">...
[info][gc] GC(15) Pause Final Mark (process weakrefs) 86.167ms
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Turns out, weak references are to blame. Put simply, weak references are a way to keep an object in memory until there is a demand for this memory. Large in-memory caches is a common use-case for weak references. If there is enough free heap, a weak reference cache entry can stay there. As soon as GC figures out that there is not enough memory, it’ll deallocate weak references. In most of the cases, this is a much better outcome than the application failing with an out of memory exception because of a cache.</p>
<p>A frantic search across the repository doesn’t show any usages of weak, soft or phantom references. Not even the search through the third party libraries can show anything. After staring at the metrics for a while, one of the graphs gives a clue! The long GC pauses correlate with a sudden drop in the number of direct byte buffers.</p>
<div>
<p>GC vs DirectByteBuffer count</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/jmc-gc.png" alt="jmc gc"></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>

You can get a similar graph by running the echo app and connecting to the JMX port. For this screenshot, I used Java Mission Control (JMC). The <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/blob/master/start.sh#L53">start.sh</a> script contains the options that you can enable to connect to an app with JMX remotely.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>At first, the correlation might not make any sense. Byte buffers are not weak references, are they? They are not weak references themselves. However, you might notice, that creating a new direct byte buffer gives you back a plain <code>ByteBuffer</code> interface which doesn’t have a <code>close</code> method or any other way of deallocating the buffer.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(42);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The underlying buffer needs to go away once the last reference to this buffer goes away. The modern API for this in Java is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ref/Cleaner.html"><code>java.lang.ref.Cleaner</code></a>. As we can see, it’s exactly what <code>DirectByteBuffer</code> class uses to determine when the underlying buffer should be deallocated.</p>
<div>

<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">DirectByteBuffer(int cap) {
    // ...
    base = UNSAFE.allocateMemory(size); // malloc call
    UNSAFE.setMemory(base, size, (byte) 0);
    // ...
    cleaner = Cleaner.create(this, new Deallocator(base, size, cap));
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yet, there are no usages of direct buffers in the code of the echo app either, so how could we find them? One way would be to search through the third party libraries using IntelliJ. The approach would work very well for the echo example but would completely fail for any real applications of a decent size. There are just way too many places where byte buffers are used. Looking at the graphs, one can notice that the number of created buffers per minute is huge, literally millions of them.</p>
<p>Instead of searching through the code to find all byte buffer references, it is easier to find the place at runtime. One way to find out where the majority of the buffers is created is to fire up the async profiler and profile the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html"><code>malloc</code></a> calls which are used by direct buffers to allocate memory.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"># async profiler can be downloaded from https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler
./profiler.sh -d 30 -f /tmp/flamegraph.svg $(pgrep -f java) -e malloc</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>While running, the profiler managed to sample more than 500000 malloc calls which non-ambiguously show where all of the buffers were created from.</p>

<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
The flame graph above visualises the code paths where most of the captured malloc calls occur. The wider the column is, the larger the number of times the code path appeared in the sample. This graph, as well as other flame graphs in this article, is clickable. You can read more on how to read flame graphs <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">here</a>.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As it turned out, there was a place in the code which was using direct buffers. With this rich knowledge of where exactly the direct buffer allocations occur, creating a fix is easy. All that’s needed is to make a one line change and to replace <code>allocateDirect</code> with <code>allocate</code> and send a <a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java/pull/945">PR upstream</a>.</p>
<p>Running the same app on shenandoah after applying the single line change produces a completely different graph which pleases the eyes with sub-millisecond GC pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>Shenandoah GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/shenandoah-heap.png" alt="shenandoah heap"></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_costs">The costs</h3>
<p>The story revealed a dark side of direct byte buffers. If there is a dark side, there must be a bright side as well! There is. But before we look at the bright side, we need to explore a few more sides which also appeared to be grey.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="_allocations">Allocations</h4>
<p>Previously, we’ve observed implicit deallocations costs, so now it’s time to take a look at allocations. Could direct buffers be much cheaper to create? After all, going off-heap has been a performance trend for a while. A small benchmark can help to estimate the costs.</p>

<h2 id="integer-underflow"><a href="#integer-underflow">Integer Underflow</a></h2>
<p>
Let us talk a little bit about integer underflow and undefined behaviour
in C before we discuss the puzzle I want to share in this post.
</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--)
        printf(".");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>

<p>
This code invokes undefined behaviour. The value in variable
<code>i</code> decrements to <code>INT_MIN</code> after
<code>|INT_MIN| + 1</code> iterations. In the next iteration, there is a
negative overflow which is undefined for signed integers in C. On many
implementations though, <code>INT_MIN - 1</code> wraps around to
<code>INT_MAX</code>. Since <code>INT_MAX</code> is not less than
<code>6</code>, the loop terminates. With such implementations, this
code prints <code>|INT_MIN| + 1</code> dots. With 32-bit integers,
that amounts to 2147483649 dots. Here is one such example output:
</p>

<pre><samp>$ <kbd>gcc -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out | wc -c</kbd>
2147483649</samp>
</pre>

<p>
It is worth noting that the above behaviour is only one of the many
possible ones. The code invokes undefined behaviour and the ISO standard
imposes no requirements on a specific implementation of the compiler
regarding what the behaviour of such code should be. For example, an
implementation could also exploit the undefined behaviour to turn the
loop into an infinite loop. In fact, GCC does optimize it to an infinite
loop if we compile the code with the <code>-O2</code> option.
</p>

<pre><samp><kbd># This never terminates!</kbd>
$ <kbd>gcc -O2 -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd>
</samp></pre>


<h2 id="puzzle"><a href="#puzzle">Puzzle</a></h2>
<p>
Let us take a look at the puzzle now.
</p>

<div>
<p>
Add or modify exactly one operator in the following code such that it
prints exactly 6 dots.
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre></div>

<p>
An obvious solution is to change <code>i--</code> to <code>i++</code>.
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre>

<p>
There are a few more solutions to this puzzle. One of the solutions is
very interesting. We will discuss the interesting solution in detail
below.
</p>


<h2 id="solutions"><a href="#solutions">Solutions</a></h2>
<p>
<em><strong>Update on 02 Oct 2011:</strong> The puzzle has been solved
in the <a href="https://susam.in/blog/loopy-c-puzzle/comments/">comments</a> section. We will discuss the
solutions now. If you want to think about the problem before you see the
solutions, this is a good time to pause and think about it. There are
spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of some solutions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; ++i)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; -i &lt; 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i + 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i ^= 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The last solution involving the bitwise XOR operation is not immediately
obvious. A little analysis is required to understand why it works. 
</p>


<h2 id="generalization"><a href="#generalization">Generalization</a></h2>
<p>
Let us generalize the puzzle by replacing \( 6 \) in the loop with an
arbitrary positive integer \( n. \) The loop in the last solution now
becomes:
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i ^= n; i--)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre>

<p>
If we denote the value of the variable <code>i</code> set by the
execution of <code>i ^= n</code> after \( k \) dots are printed as
\( f(k), \) then

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                       &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(k - 1) - 1) &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is a positive integer,
and the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.

Note that \( f(0) \) represents the value of <code>i</code> set by the
execution of <code>i ^= n</code> when no dots have been printed yet.
</p>

<p>
If we can show that \( n \) is the least value of \( k \) for which \(
f(k) = 0, \) it would prove that the loop terminates after printing
\( n \) dots.
</p>

<p>
We will see in the next section that for odd values of \( n, \)

\[
f(k) =
\begin{cases}
n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
\end{cases}
\]

Therefore there is no value of \( k \) for which \( f(k) = 0 \) when \(
n \) is odd. As a result, the loop never terminates when \( n \) is odd.
</p>

<p>
We will then see that for even values of \( n \) and
\( 0 \leq k \leq n, \)

\[
f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
\]

Therefore the loop terminates after printing \( n \) dots when \( n \)
is even.

<h2 id="lemmas"><a href="#lemmas">Lemmas</a></h2>
<p>
We will first prove a few lemmas about some interesting properties of
the bitwise XOR operation. We will then use it to prove the claims made
in the previous section.
</p>

<!-- Lemma 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 1.</strong>
<em>
For an odd positive integer \( n, \)

\[
n \oplus (n - 1) = 1
\]

where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m \dots b_1 b_0 \)
where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and \( b_m \) represents the most
significant nonzero bit of \( n. \) Since \( n \) is an odd number,
\( b_0 = 1. \)

Thus \( n \) may be written as

\[ b_m \dots b_1 1. \]

As a result \( n - 1 \) may be written as

\[ b_m \dots b_1 0. \]

The bitwise XOR of both binary representations is \( 1. \)
</p>

<!-- Lemma 2 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 2.</strong>
<em>
For a nonnegative integer \( n, \)

\[
n \oplus 1 =
  \begin{cases}
    n + 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even}, \\
    n - 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
  \end{cases}
\]

where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m \dots b_1 b_0 \)
where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and \( b_m \) represents the most
significant nonzero bit of \( n. \)
</p>
<p>
If \( n \) is even, \( b_0 = 0. \) In this case, \( n \) may be written
as \( b_m \dots b_1 0. \) Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be written as \( b_m
\dots b_1 1. \) Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n + 1. \)
</p>

<p>
If \( n \) is odd, \( b_0 = 1. \) In this case, \( n \) may be written
as \( b_m \dots b_1 1. \) Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be written as \( b_m
\dots b_1 0. \) Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n - 1. \)
</p>

<p>
Note that for odd \( n, \) lemma 1 can also be derived as a corollary of
lemma 2 in this manner:

\[
k \oplus (k - 1)
= k \oplus (k \oplus 1)
= (k \oplus k) \oplus 1
= 0 \oplus 1
= 1.
\]
</p>


<!-- Lemma 3 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 3.</strong>
<em>
If \( x \) is an even nonnegative integer and \( y \) is an odd positive
integer, then \( x \oplus y \) is odd, where the symbol \( \oplus \)
denotes bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( x \) be \( b_{xm_x} \dots b_{x1}
b_{x0} \) and that of \( y \) be \( b_{ym_y} \dots b_{y1} b_{y0} \)
where \( m_x \) and \( m_y \) are nonnegative integers and \( b_{xm_x}
\) and \( b_{xm_y} \) represent the most significant nonzero bits of \(
x \) and \( y, \) respectively.
</p>

<p>
Since \( x \) is even, \( b_{x0} = 0. \) Since \( y \) is odd,
\( b_{y0} = 1. \)
</p>

<p>
Let \( z = x \oplus y \) with a binary representation of \( b_{zm_z}
\dots b_{z1} b_{z0} \) where \( m_{zm_z} \) is a nonnegative integer and
\( b_{zm_z} \) is the most significant nonzero bit of \( z. \)
</p>

<p>
We get \( b_{z0} = b_{x0} \oplus b_{y0} = 0 \oplus 1 = 1. \) Therefore
\( z \) is odd.
</p>


<h2 id="theorems"><a href="#theorems">Theorems</a></h2>

<!-- Theorem 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Theorem 1.</strong>
<em>
Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
integers and

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1.
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer and \( n \) is an odd positive
integer. Then

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
      1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
    \end{cases}
\]
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
This is a proof by mathematical induction. We have \( f(0) = n \) by
definition. Therefore the base case holds good.
</p>

<p>
Let us assume that \( f(k) = n \) for any even \( k \) (induction
hypothesis). Let \( k' = k + 1 \) and \( k'' = k + 2. \)
</p>

<p>
If \( k \) is even, we get

\begin{align*}
f(k')  &amp; = n \oplus (f(k) - 1)  &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus (n - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis)} \\
       &amp; = 1                    &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 1)},\\
f(k'') &amp; = n \oplus (f(k') - 1) &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus (1 - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(since \( f(k') = 1\))} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus 0 \\
       &amp; = n.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
Since \( f(k'') = n \) and \( k'' \) is the next even number after
\( k, \) the induction step is complete. The induction step shows that
for every even \( k, \) \( f(k) = n \) holds good. It also shows that as
a result of \( f(k) = n \) for every even \( k, \) we get \( f(k') = 1
\) for every odd \( k'. \)
</p>

<!-- Theorem 2 -->
<p>
<strong>Theorem 2.</strong>
<em>
Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
integers and

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1.
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is an even positive
integer, and \( 0 \leq k \leq n. \) Then

\[
  f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
\]
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
We will first show by the principle of mathematical induction that for
even \( k, \) \( f(k) = n - k. \) We have \( f(0) = n \) by definition,
so the base case holds good. Now let us assume that \( f(k) = n - k \)
holds good for any even \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq n \) (induction
hypothesis).
</p><p>
Since \( n \) is even (by definition) and \( k \) is even (by induction
hypothesis), \( f(k) = n - k \) is even. As a result, \( f(k) - 1 \) is
odd. By lemma 3, we conclude that \( f(k + 1) = n \oplus (f(k) - 1) \)
is odd.
</p>

<p>
Now we perform the induction step as follows:

\begin{align*}
f(k + 2) &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) - 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
         &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
         &amp; = n \oplus ((n \oplus (f(k) - 1)) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
         &amp; = (n \oplus n ) \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by associativity of XOR)} \\
         &amp; = 0 \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1) \\
         &amp; = (f(k) - 1) \oplus 1 \\
         &amp; = (f(k) - 1) - 1
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(from lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
         &amp; = f(k) - 2 \\
         &amp; = n - k - 2
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis).}
\end{align*}

This completes the induction step and proves that \( f(k) = n - k \)
for even \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq n. \)
</p>

<p>
We have shown above that \( f(k) \) is even for every even \( k \) where
\( 0 \leq k \leq n \) which results in \( …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the C++ application development, sometimes, we would like to hide the private methods and member variables so that the users will not try to get access to those member methods and variables.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss how to do it using abstract class declarations.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-class">Abstract Class</h3>

<p>An abstract class is a class that either defines or inherits at least one function for which the final overrider is pure virtual.</p>



<p>To understand virtual and pure virtual, we have to understand what C++ polymorphisms are. I have a blog post <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/CPP-Polymorphisms/">“C++ Polymorphisms”</a> on this topic. Some of its simple examples could also be found on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/abstract_class">CPP Reference</a>.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Here we would create a bot application which will simply introduce itself and say hello to the user. All the source code could be found on my <a href="https://github.com/leimao/CPP-Public-Header-Abstract-Class-Declarations-Example">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>We would like to create an implementation for class <code>Bot</code>. The following declaration was used for building the library <code>libbot.so</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>

    <span>Bot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>

<span>private:</span>

    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>mBotName</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, sometimes, we don’t want the users to know the private methods and members. In more complex cases, the number of private methods and members could be huge. Only the public methods are designed to be useful for the users. If we provide the following simplified header to the users, and ask the users to use the header in their application implementations, the users will run into problems.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// public_bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>

    <span>Bot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>
    
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because C++ has to know all the methods and the members of an object during compile-time. The size of such object is thus determined during compile-time. Using an object declaration that does not contain the private methods and members that it should have will result in the building of an incomplete object during runtime. Thus running those applications will run into errors if any private methods and members were accessed by the public methods.</p>



<p>So what could we do if we would like to only expose the public methods and the program is still executable? We could use abstract class. The following header is used for building the library <code>libvirtual_bot.so</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// virtual_bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>IBot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>IBot</span><span>*</span> <span>createBot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Bot</span> <span>:</span> <span>public</span> <span>IBot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>

    <span>Bot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>

<span>private:</span>

    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>mBotName</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following header is given to the user for creating the application.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// public_virtual_bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>IBot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>IBot</span><span>*</span> <span>createBot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>

<span>// The declaration of Bot is hidden.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this header, the users do not know the existence of <code>Bot</code> yet they can still call all the public methods of <code>Bot</code>. All they should deal with is the abstract class <code>IBot</code>. An instance of <code>Bot</code> could be created by calling the <code>createBot</code> method and returning a base <code>IBot</code> pointer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Say you're about to build a new project. You're an expert in a few languages, and you have a sense of the ecosystem in general. How do you choose the language you build with? I wanted to share my decision framework with you. </p><p>Some requirements can eliminate entire categories of choices. Let’s use that to our advantage: start by narrowing down your choices. For example:</p><p><strong>Do you need extreme efficiency?</strong> This would mean your code may need to be compiled and that you can’t have run-time garbage collection. Well, that narrows down your choices quite a bit. </p><p><strong>Do you need math-level proofs that your code works as expected?</strong> This would mean you need an <em>extremely</em> strong type system. Bam, narrows choices down quite a bit </p><p><strong>Do you need concurrency?</strong> There are only a few VMs and a few languages that are known to be <em>excellent</em> for concurrency. Depending on what you need, this will narrow your choices down to a few families.</p><p><strong>Do you work in a larger environment?</strong> If you are building something, and your entire company is on one stack, there’s so much power to the existing ecosystem that this effectively narrows down your choice to the language of your environment.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Is your problem in a domain where the ecosystem in one language is strongest?</strong> If you’re in machine learning, the ecosystem in python is so powerful that it almost guarantees to narrow down your choice to that language.</p><p><strong>Is your problem a small script that needs to run everywhere?</strong> This narrows your choices down to the languages that are available by default on Linux</p><p>Now, there’s a leverage point here: constraints narrow down your choices in a significant way. If you add a constraint you didn’t need, you risk sacrificing a large set of options. For example, many think their system needs to scale from the get-go. This is rarely the case and kills some of the choices that contributed to the success of the biggest companies today <sup>2</sup></p><p>So pick your constraints carefully. Once you do though, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how much clarity they give you: your choices will have gone through a significant filter.</p><p>The next filter is effectiveness. Choose the language that maximizes your output on a time scale you care about.</p><p>At this stage, there is often a tradeoff between what you’re comfortable with and what you need to discover. Say you’re comfortable in assembly, but don’t know any other languages. What should you do?</p><p>Well, for some very small problems, it <em>does</em> make sense to just write them in assembly. If they’re urgent, you have no other choice. But for any significant work, you’ll outstrip the productivity of assembly within a few days of ramp-up. </p><p>The same kind of spectrum exists in higher-level languages, but the differences take longer to show up. If you’re comfortable with Java, for example, you can get a lot done pretty quickly. But within <em>some</em> period, the productivity benefits pale in comparison to more powerful languages.</p><p>Making this choice is a bit of an art, but it works like this. You want to think about a time-frame that you’d like to optimize and pick the language that optimizes for effectiveness within that timeframe. </p><p>If you’re in a hurry, you have no choice but to use what you’re comfortable with, no matter how limiting. There are two ways to avoid the dilemma. You can either play with different languages before you start your project, so you have a wider array of comfortable choices to pick from, or give yourself a few months to ramp up and select the language that’s most effective for your problem.</p><p>With that, the question comes, <em>what time frame</em> should you optimize for? This is in itself an art. For startups, I would say about 8-12 months. Planning further than that is over-optimization. For larger companies, I’d think 2-5 years.</p><p>Now you’ve gone through two filters. Say you narrowed down to just a few choices, but you aren’t sure which one to take.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>Have all your habits back in the COVID ‘lock-down’ started to go away once the society opened up again? What seems like productive reading time in the morning reverted back to mindless commutes between work and home. I can relate and in november, this is my attempt to get back to my reading habits every single day.</p>

<p>Back in my previous article <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-07-20-articles-of-july/">Want to improve? You have got to read</a>, I’ve wrriten how improvement and personal development happens when you put in the time to read and learn. If personal development is important for you, prioritize time to read.</p>

</ul>

<p>For all developers whom are looking for direct alternatives to google’s tools. it is interesting to see the extent of inconvenience this community of non-googlers would go just not to use google. Privacy definitely has its importance; all the more paramount when its used in your disfavour.</p>

<p>The more time you spent building your product, your own furniture, or even your software will create this irrational love for it. Some call it the ikea effect where furnitures build by your own hands seems to have more worth than it actually has - an addition of sentimental worth.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s often effort that ultimately creates long-term satisfaction,” wrote Dan Ariely wrote in his book&nbsp;The Upside of Irrationality, after co-authoring the Ikea effect paper. “Greater labor leads to greater love.”</p>

<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design">Top 10 designs of good products</a></li>
</ul>

<p>While it is not entirely true, there are some good pointers to take away from this article. Coincidentally, I agree with point 2,4,6,8,10. A good design makes a product understandable. The design is supposed to make the product self explanatory. The classical example is how a 3 year old was able to understand how to use an iphone without any manual or explanation. That is a ton of genius packed into one small device.</p>

</ul>

<p>It is interesting how things that we take for granted are actually a solution to challenging problems that were faced by the previous generations. While it is a story back into history, here is a quote from John E. Warnock, the cofounder of Adobe.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“What industries badly need is a universal way to communicate documents across a wide variety of machine configurations, operating systems and communication networks. These documents should be viewable on any display and should be printable on any modern printers. If this problem can be solved, then the fundamental way people work will change.”  — John E. Warnock, the cofounder of Adobe</p>

While Apple is talking about saving the earth by producing less electronic waste, I would hope to see how they are backing up their attempts with statistics. Beyond that, I just think its ridiculous to say that and charging new charging brick and new charging wires at such an exorbitant price. One always wonder what would Steve Jobs do.</li>

</ul>

<p>Rather than to fight the slow fight to convince others to drive less and thus have less cars on the road, how about a radical alternative?</p>

<p>Give them an pleasant alternative, escooters. This can help to cover short distance travels, it also help us to see how the government can chart the way for a societal change in lifestyle. A step forward for countries to reduce in carbon footprint is to create bicycle lanes to encourage more bicycle as preferred mode of transport.</p>

<p>Give them space and time to work, free from distractions. Work from home’s top distractions are actually the consistent messages that keeps coming in while being physically around your coworkers.</p>

<p>Work from home allows you the socially acceptable approach to mute your employees so you can focus on the tasks before you. While WFH heightens the room for productivity, people are feeling more lonely than before.</p>

<p>The disconnection with their coworkers can also affect their productivity as their mental wellness can be affected with prolong isolation. Companies however feels that it is personal employee responsibility to get themselves connected. Essentially, while it is true to a large extent, companies can play its part to setup itself up for success; not by luck but by design. This includes digital engagements, interactive digital townhall, more frequent get togethers once in a while to bring people together.</p>

<p>Using null might be interesting if you care about property existence. If it is undefined, you wouldnt know if the variable foo might be undefined or if the object doesn’t have a property foo. If you want to explicitly communicate via types that property foo exists and might have a bottom value. Then null is one of your approach.</p>

<p>It is your experiences and achievements that shows how good a programmer you are. Flush those out.

<p>The secret to serving static video content is to use CDNs.<br>
<a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html">This</a> is a simple description of what is a CDN. This might be my an interesting topic to delve deeper to explore the science behind this magic.</p>

<p>Some of the CDNs includes Limelight, Level 3, Akamai, CloudFront, and CloudFlare. For Netflix, they created their own CDN call <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/">Open Connect</a>. This is definitely another tool to explore.</p>

<p>Here’s an overview of how Netflix uses the client to determine the *best CDN to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API signals that the content this person is trying to watch is on, say, 10 different CDN servers.</li>
<li>The client intelligence picks the CDN that it calculates to be best*</li>
<li>The client intelligence continually probes to find the best way of receiving content</li>

<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/">Cattle vs pet cloud mental analogy</a><br>
A short glimpse into what pet vs cattle systems are. The definitions based on the post has accurately described them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique systems that can never be down. Typically they are manually built, managed, and “hand fed”. Examples include mainframes, solitary servers, HA loadbalancers/firewalls (active/active or active/passive), database systems designed as master/slave (active/passive), and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cattle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated tools, and are designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable. Typically, during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits attributes of “routing around failures” by restarting failed servers or replicating data through strategies like triple replication or erasure coding. Examples include web server arrays, multi-master datastores such as Cassandra clusters, multiple racks of gear put together in clusters, and just about anything that is load-balanced and multi-master.\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can go down whenever, however. But they are always creating new server applications to ensure that the service is online.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>Reading has this compounding effect with tangible effects budding months or even years of consistent practice. In technology, while it is easy to just chase the work and code, one of the most fundamental habits of x10 engineers is the habit of reading and immersing themselves in tech talks and discussions. May us all engineers develop this habit and make the world a better place; one piece of code at a time.</p>

			<p>Founded in 2020 amidst the pandemic, Minus Zero is on a quest to build indigenous fully Self Driving Car in India by late 2023, competing with the likes of Elon Musk’s Tesla, Google’s Waymo and others in the industry. It’s not long before India will have its own ‘Made in India’ autonomous vehicle able to drive itself with zero human supervision in a challenging traffic like India’s. Being one of the most rising use cases of Artificial Intelligence, this can make India a leader in global tech ecosystem.&nbsp;Minus Zero is a deep-tech start-up working to leverage the power of moon-shot innovation to an inclusive society at large.                <!-- <div class="PT10 TAC PB10"><div id="crt_728x90a"></div></div> -->

They have been gathering the best young minds from all across the country to work on these projects.&nbsp;“Our country’s youth has immense brain power, it’s high time that we align it in the right direction, to a bigger cause of making our country a technology leader. The road is tough, but we need to start somewhere.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've validated your micro-SaaS idea and are ready to start building the product.</p><p>The obvious next questions are</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Which features should the product include in its first version?</li><li>How long should you take to build it?</li></ol><p>Through this post, I provide you with a framework to identify your initial product features, how to decide what to include or exclude from the first versions, and continue building upon it.</p><p>Before jumping into MLP, let's first understand what MVP&nbsp;is and why it's not enough in today's times.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ericries" target="_blank">Eric Ries</a> popularized the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">minimum viable product</a> in his book <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/" target="_blank">The Lean Startup</a> as that version of a new product that is just usable enough by early customers who can then provide feedback to the team. This feedback should help the team generate validated learnings and guide them on future product development and features.</p><h4>When MVP still works</h4><p>MVP is not dead though. It still works, given the right kind of problem statements.</p><p>Suppose you're building something that simply doesn't exist in the world, and it's something that people really want and have no alternative to getting it except from you.</p><p>At this time, people will accept a textbook MVP, simply because they have no frame of reference to compare it with. Or better yet, because they have no alternative to replace your MVP with.</p><h4>Why MVP&nbsp;is not enough in 2021</h4><p>Over the past few years as smartphone penetration boomed, products matured, product design and user experience matured, people's expectations have increased.</p><p>No longer does a quickly thrown together prototype cut it. People expect a minimum level of good UX and ease-of-use, else they'll leave your app before even giving it a proper try.</p><p>In fact, in 2021 great UX might be one strong reason people pick your product over incumbents. That's what happened with <a href="https://transistor.fm/" target="_blank">Transistor.fm</a>, who made podcast hosting simple and easy.</p><p>People expect good aesthetics that make a first impression, simply because that's what they have become used to from the plethora of beautiful and well-designed apps out there in the world.</p><p>People expect products to be fully functional as advertised. Buggy products are not acceptable, and in fact people might quickly take to Twitter or social media to let others know that a product is unreliable.</p><p>The MVP mindset intensely focuses on building the bare minimum, and that often leaves users frustrated and drives them to seek alternative solutions. Stiffer competition means that people WILL compare your product to alternatives in the market, it's inevitable. And unless you provide something unique and valuable that nobody else does, people are likely to leave.</p><p>All these reasons and more make MVP&nbsp;a dated concept, especially in the context of SaaS products. But above all, I think the MVP mindset makes product builders think too heavily about the "minimum" and often so at the cost of "viable".</p><p>That's a common pitfall and to avoid that, I propose the MLP framework.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP)?</h2><p>A great new concept that I've fallen in love with and personally follow in every product I build is MLP, or Minimum Loveable Product.</p><p>The term MLP was first coined by Brian de Haaff, the co-founder of Aha!, in his book <a href="https://www.aha.io/lovability" target="_blank">Lovability</a>.</p><p>Its definition is an extension of what Eric Ries already introduced to the world with MVP. With MLP though, you are trying to build the minimum "loveable" product, with a focus on no matter how small or feature-stripped the first version of your product is, it is sufficient to deliver a delightful experience to your user.</p><h4>Minimum Viable Product and the burnt pizza analogy</h4><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaona/" target="_blank">Jiaona Zhang</a>, who is currently VP&nbsp;of Product at Webflow (this blog is built using Webflow) introduced the <a href="https://firstround.com/review/dont-serve-burnt-pizza-and-other-lessons-in-building-minimum-lovable-products/" target="_blank">burnt pizza analogy</a> to her students at Stanford.</p><p>“<em>Say you’re trying to test whether people like pizza. If you serve them burnt pizza, you’re not getting feedback on whether they like pizza. You only know that they don’t like burnt pizza. Similarly, when you’re only relying on the MVP, the fastest and cheapest functional prototype, you risk not actually testing your product, but rather a poor or flawed version of it.</em>"</p><p>A great practical example of Minimum Loveable Product is the Apple iPad. All the tablets that came before Apple's tablet were MVPs.</p><h2>MLP vs MVP</h2><p>If you're new to all these terminologies, I understand that it can be confusing. Bear with me, you'll wrap your head around it soon enough.</p><p>Build an MLP when you are solving a problem that's already understood by people, and an MVP when people don't easily understand a problem.</p><p>Build an MLP when you can clearly define and understand a market and you are trying to stand out from the existing tools. Build an MVP when you're trying to gauge if there even exists a market to serve.</p><p>An&nbsp;MLP can be built when you know exactly what customers want. An MVP is when you don't know what customers want, and therefore you want to throw things at the wall as quickly as possible and see what sticks.</p><p>An MLP is necessary if you are building in a market where several large and well-known alternatives already exist. An MVP is the right approach for a new market with barely any alternatives, or those solutions are not yet known by the masses.</p><p>While building an MLP, you make a dedicated effort to succeed with that idea. With MVP, you are trying to determine quickly whether the idea can succeed or whether it will fail.</p><p>Building an&nbsp;MVP means you're ready for failure and also ready to pivot quickly as you learn more about the market. Which means you should make tech and architecture decisions that help you move fast above anything else. Scalability or good architecture design is a concern to pay attention to while building an MLP.</p><p>Finally, the end goal of an MLP is that the customers who use it find it sufficient in functionality and experience to be able to "love" it. With an MLP, you're building just enough that a customer with (hopefully) a real pain point would "tolerate" and continue using your product while you validate your assumptions.</p><h2>Minimum Marketable Product, Minimum Remarkable Product, Minimum Launchable Product</h2><p>The what?</p><p>I know, I know. I came across these terms for the first time today while researching to write this post. And I went through the literature so that I can tell you to safely ignore it.</p><p>If you understand and embody the concept of MLP, you don't need to think about any other frameworks or terminologies that you may discover while researching on Google.</p><h2>How to build an MLP for your Micro SaaS idea</h2><p>Alright, let's put aside theory and dive right in.</p><p>Here are the steps you should loosely follow to building an MLP.</p><h4>1. Understand the #1 problem you're trying to solve</h4><p>What's the #1 reason someone would want to use your Micro SaaS product over existing alternatives?</p><p>Is it that existing options have poor UX?&nbsp;Great, create a well designed and easy-to-use product. You'd be surprised to know how often people switch to an easier to use tool, simply because they are fed up of the poor UX that they encounter repeatedly.</p><p>Is it that existing alternatives are very expensive?&nbsp;Carve out a minimum set of features that people are paying a lot of money for and charge 1/10th for your v1 product. This might not work for very large customers, but vast majority of customers who are small or mid-sized are always looking for affordable alternatives.</p><p>It might not just be raw quantum of pricing, but certain companies targeting Enterprise customers have very complicated pricing slabs and tiers that are designed to give their sales person more room. In such a case, coming out with a competitor product which has a simple, easy-to-understand pricing is how you attract customers.</p><p>Are existing alternatives lacking certain features that leaves a subset of users very dissatisfied?&nbsp;Great, your MLP should specifically address that problem by building functionality that attracts these dissatisfied users. Side note - This is perhaps one of the best ways to go about building a new product.</p><p>In all cases, it involves understanding the problem you are solving and the exact reason why someone would use your product.</p><h4>2. Design a simple product that solves the top customer needs satisfactorily</h4><p>Once you have identified the #1 reason, it's time to decide on a feature set for your product that solves your customer's top pain points satisfactorily.</p><p><strong>Let's take an example</strong> - People want to add a feedback tracking tool inside their product, so that they can collect user feedback automatically. However, the existing solutions don't allow them to embed the feedback tracker within their tool.</p><p>That's your entry point into providing value that customers seek, but are not getting as of today.</p><p>Having understood the #1 problem, you also have to understand other requirements that fall under the "minimum" set of things you need to do to build a "loveable" product.</p><p>These could be:</p><ul role="list"><li>existing solutions are all well designed and aesthetically pleasing =&gt;&nbsp;your minimum loveable product needs to be well designed too</li><li>existing solutions are affordably priced with a easy to understand pricing structure =&gt; your MLP also needs a simple pricing structure that's affordable</li></ul><p>In general, you want to analyze your competitors and understand </p><ol start="" role="list"><li>What they are doing well</li><li>What users value from among those things</li></ol><p>In your MLP, you need to cover the intersection of (what they are doing well) x (what users value from among those).</p><h4>3. Set a short timeline for building your MLP</h4><p>No matter what you build, building in isolation for too long is dangerous. The main reason for that is - you get to know too late whether your assumptions about what the user really values are on point or off course.</p><p><strong>"But Preetam, you just told me to build a Minimum Loveable Product. And now you're saying I got to build it quickly?"</strong></p><p>Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.</p><p>Short timeframe depends on what you are building, and the size of your team.</p><p>For example - with SuperLemon (WhatsApp plugin for Shopify), Sankalp and I built a MLP in 2 weeks time.</p><p>How?</p><p>We identified precisely the way we could do better - …</p></div></div>

<h2>C++ Vector</h2>
<p>A <b>vector</b> is a sequence container implementing array that can change in size. Unlike array, the size of a vector changes automatically when elements are appended or deleted. </p>
<p>Vector stores elements in contiguous memory location which enables direct access of any elements using <span>operator []</span>. To support shrink and expand functionality at runtime, vector container may allocate some extra storage. Hence, compared to array, vector requires more memory and in return it manage memory dynamically and efficiently.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Both are APIs for shared-memory programming. In C, OpenMP is a relatively high-level extension, providing compiler directives for parallelizing many programs with ease while some low-level thread interactions may be difficult to program. Pthreads provide some low-level coordination constructs that are unavailable in OpenMP, making other programs easier to parallelize while requiring explicit specification of the behavior of each thread, which may virtually be any that is conceivable.</p>
<p>Pthreads programs can be used with <em>any</em> C compiler, provided the system has a Pthreads library. OpenMP requires compiler support for some operations, which <em>many</em> compilers provide.</p>
<h3 id="area-under-the-curve">Area Under the Curve</h3>
<p>The program we are about to develop is oftentimes called the 'Hello world!' of parallel programming. We will be using the following formula for <cite>arctan(1)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></cite> in approximating the value for π.</p>

<p>Going through the serial version of the program in C, the value for above is calculated for each integer within range <strong>[1, N)</strong> and summed up within a loop. The resulting <strong>sum</strong> is them divided by <strong>N</strong> for getting an estimate of <strong>π / 4</strong>, before printing out the calculated <em>approximate</em> for π.</p>

<p>To compile above with <code>gcc</code>, use following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">gcc -o &lt;outputname&gt; &lt;filename&gt;.c -f openmp -lm -Wall -g
</code></pre></div><h3 id="modifying-parallelized-code">Modifying Parallelized Code</h3>
<p>Before changing anything, it pays to understand whatever we want changed in the first-place. So, let us go through the above code. The function <code>omp_get_wtime()</code>, defined in <code>omp.h</code>, returns the amount of seconds since a previous <em>fixed</em> point in time (included for execution timing purposes). Setting the number of threads to spawn when running parallel code (code inside parallel scope, that is) done by <code>omp_set_num_threds</code>. Changing the <code>set</code> to <code>get</code> and calling from <em>within</em> a parallel section returns the number of threads in execution (<code>get</code> counterpart is available for most functions with <code>set</code>). However, due to resource constraints on the system, it is possible we ending up with a lower number of threads.</p>
<p>The directive <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> is for parallelizing the code–it is safe to assume if this is not present somewhere, the program will not be parallelized by OpenMP. The scope of code that needs to be executed in parallel may be defined the same way we do scoping in C, with <code>{}</code>, or without–whereas only immediately following code line will be considered in-scope. This is where new threads will be spawned and start running alongside the master thread, branching the execution.</p>
<p>Any variables created within the parallel scope are private for each thread (i.e. <code>sum_thread</code>), and will not contribute to race conditions. Therefore, the <code>for</code> loop incrementing <code>sum_thread</code> is divided among threads spawned. Please note the way threads divide the iterations among themselves can be handled up to some extent with specific directives, the default behavior is expected here by omitting them.</p>
<p>Critical sections may be scoped within <code>#pragma omp atomic</code> or <code>#pragma omp critical</code>. The former enables low level atomicity of execution (with higher performance) if available, and only accepts a single assignment statement (of an allowed form) within scope, while the latter can handle multiple statements. Both effectively serializes execution. If we end up with most of the code within the scope of either, our code is probably too poor for parallelization with OpenMP.</p>
<p>Outside the <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> scope, previously spawned threads will join the master thread, and it will continue executing similar to a serial program. It is worth mentioning that we may have as many parallel/serial sections as we please.</p>
<p>As should be apparent from above, OpenMP is designed to be easy to learn and can be used for parallelizing existing serial code with minimal modifications. What if we could further simplify the above code?</p>
<h3 id="reducing-the-parallel-code">Reducing the Parallel Code</h3>
<p>Modifying the <code>sum</code> variable at the end of the <code>for</code> loop in above code could be simplified with a reduction operation provided by OpenMP. That is, we can instruct OpenMP to synchronously add the <em>local sum</em> calculated by each thread (within loop) to the shared variable <code>sum</code> as shown in the parallel version below.</p>

<p>Here, we have a single statement <code>#pragma omp parallel for</code> that tells we want the immediately-following <code>for</code> loop parallelized, which is identical to having <code>#pragma omp for</code> immediately before a <code>for</code> loop <em>within</em> the scope of <code>#pragma omp parallel</code>. The <code>reduction(+:sum)</code> tells that we want the <code>sum</code> variable to contain the <em>sum</em> of each local sum calculated in each iteration only available locally to the thread that runs it. OpenMP does this by creating a private <em>sum</em> variable for each thread and initializing it to <strong>unit</strong> according to the operation (ex. <strong>0</strong> for <code>+</code>, <strong>1</strong> for <code>*</code>), this is how we use the <strong>reduction operator</strong> in OpenMP. The <code>shared(N)</code> tells that the <code>N</code> variable should be shared with all threads, this is fine since threads are only reading it–therefore no potential data races. Finally, the approximated values along with the time taken for calculations are printed.</p>
<p>Now that we went through the code, note that the  <code>omp_set_num_threads</code> is not mandatory when using OpenMP, the program defaults to spawning the maximum number of threads possible on the system at execution time.

      <p>The social sciences have witnessed a dramatic shift in the last 25 years. Rigorous research designs have drastically improved the credibility of research findings. However, while research designs have improved, less progress has been made in relating experimental findings to the views of the broader scientific community and policy-makers. Individual researchers have begun to gather predictions about the effects they might find in their studies, as this information can be helpful in interpreting research results. Still, we could learn more from predictions if they were elicited in a coordinated, systematic way.</p>
<p>This prediction platform will allow for the systematic collection and assessment of expert forecasts of the effects of untested social programs. In turn, this should help both policy makers and social scientists by improving the accuracy of forecasts, allowing for more effective decision-making and improving experimental design and analysis.</p>

<div>
<h3>Measuring and improving the accuracy of forecasts</h3>
<p>Collecting and evaluating a body of priors across members of an expert community can expose whether and how predictions are systematically biased or inaccurate, and can allow us to explore adjustments or corrections that yield more reliable forecasts. It can similarly allow us to identify circumstances that affect the accuracy of predictions and superforecasters, guiding the improvement of the accuracy of future forecasts.</p>
<p>Improving the accuracy of forecasts and identifying consistently accurate forecasters will be particularly valuable to policy makers who often must rely on expert predictions and scientific consensus when considering policy options, and particularly when investment decisions must be made in the absence of RCTs or other rigorous evidence. Many policy analysts already make and use predictions informally and could benefit from infrastructure that standardizes the sourcing and cataloguing of knowledge, similar to how the American Economic Association has systematized registration with the RCT Registry. If forecasts and their accuracy are tracked over time, they can also be combined with newer or crowdsourced predictions, giving more weight to those of superforecasters, to weed out interventions with a lower likelihood of success. There is clear demand from research organizations and funders for this kind of standardization.</p>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Mitigating publication bias</h3>
<p>In cases where null results are known to have been unexpected, we can treat them not as null results, but as rejecting previously held priors. We propose to use ex ante priors, such as the mean or median forecast, as an alternative hypothesis against which to test experimental results. Importantly, forecasts will need to be collected ex ante, given that it is all too easy to rationalize any result ex post (hindsight bias).</p>
</div>




<div>
<h3>Improving experimental design</h3>
<p>The collection of priors, much like pre-analysis plans, focuses attention on the hypotheses to be tested and helps to highlight which research questions have the highest value. It can also improve the efficiency of research by allowing for a more optimal allocation of participants across treatment arms or by focusing attention on those outcome variables for which more data would have the highest value of information.		</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock in this offering. The selling stockholders identified in this prospectus are offering to sell an additional
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being sold by the selling stockholders. </p>
<p>We have two classes of authorized common stock, Class&nbsp;A common stock and Class&nbsp;B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class&nbsp;A common
stock and Class&nbsp;B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of Class&nbsp;A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class&nbsp;B common stock is entitled to twenty votes per share
and is convertible at any time into one share of Class&nbsp;A common stock. Following this offering, entities affiliated with David Baszucki, our Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chair of our board of directors will hold all
outstanding shares of our Class&nbsp;B common stock representing approximately &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, Mr.&nbsp;Baszucki will be able to significantly influence any action
requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all
of our assets or other major corporate transaction. Also as a result, we believe we are eligible for, but do not intend to take advantage of, the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for New York Stock
Exchange-listed companies. </p> <p>Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class&nbsp;A common stock. It is currently estimated that
the initial public offering price per share will be between $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We intend to apply to list our Class&nbsp;A common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol “RBLX.” </p> <p>We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of
2012 and, as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for this prospectus and may elect to do so in future filings. </p> <center>

<ul>
<li><strong>Completely serverless</strong>: I don’t want to manage any infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>(almost) Free</strong>: It should cost close to $0 for my use-case which I will talk about below.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-step workflows</strong>: Currently, Zapier’s free tier only lets you perform one action for a particular trigger. I wanted the ability to perform multiple actions (for e.g. send an email and a slack message) for a particular trigger.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks support</strong>: I’m a big fan of <a href="https://zapier.com/page/webhooks/">Zapier’s webhooks</a> functionality and want to replicate that.</li>
<li><strong>Polling-based workflows</strong>: Ability to poll an API endpoint and take action if there is new data available</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The following section will provide an overview of the system based on the requirements we came up with.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-workflow">What is a workflow?</h3>
<p>A workflow can be defined as a Trigger and a series of actions that are taken as a result of the Trigger. The trigger can be based on webhooks or polling.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/workflow.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/workflow.png"></p>
<p>There are various ways to model a workflow. Some of the most common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using code</strong>: In a system like <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, a workflow (called a DAG) is defined in Python using Airflow specific abstractions.</li>
<li><strong>Using config files</strong>: A workflow engine like <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/projects/argo/">Argo</a>, which is built on top of Kubernetes, uses YAML to define workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep our system simple, we will define our workflows using JSON. JSON is natively supported in Python (my language of choice) along with many other programming languages.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-trigger">What is a Trigger?</h3>
<p>A trigger is the root node of a workflow. We will support two types of triggers in our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong>: The workflow will expose a webhook that can be used to initiate this particular workflow. The webhook will accept POST requests.</li>
<li><strong>Polling:</strong> The workflow will specify an API endpoint which will be polled at a regular interval. If new data is available, then specified actions will be run</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-an-action">What is an Action?</h3>
<p>An action is performed as a result of a workflow being triggered. We will support two types of actions in our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email</strong>: Send an email with the data coming from the trigger</li>
<li><strong>Slack</strong>: Send a slack message with the data coming from the trigger.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="designing-the-system">Designing the system</h2>
<p>In the following section, we will take a look at the various services we will be using to build the system based on our requirements.</p>
<h3 id="creating-webhooks">Creating Webhooks</h3>
<p>Since one of the main requirements for the system is to be serverless, we will leverage API Gateway and Lambda to support webhooks. API Gateway will create a single endpoint that we can use to send webhooks and we will do the filtering in our Lambda function.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/webhooks.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/webhooks.png"></p>
<h3 id="supporting-polling-based-triggers">Supporting Polling-based Triggers</h3>
<p>Polling triggers are slightly more involved. The system comprises of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents-expressions.html">Lambda function scheduled</a> at a regular frequency. This lambda function will go through all the workflows that are polling-based and put them in an SQS queue. The benefit of decoupling the scheduling of the workflow from the processing of the workflow is that we will be communicating with external services that could be unreliable. If there is a failure, we want to isolate it to a particular workflow.</li>
<li>Lambda function which gets triggered whenever there is a new workflow has been enqueued. This function is responsible for executing the trigger i.e. querying the API endpoint and checking if there is any new data available.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/polling-trigger.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/polling-trigger.png"></p>
<h3 id="de-duplication">De-duplication</h3>
<p>We only want to execute our actions for the polling-based workflows when there is new data. To support this, we will use a de-duplication identifier similar to <a href="https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/data-deduplication-in-zaps">Zapier</a>. We will use DynamoDB to store the identifiers we have already processed for a particular workflow. Since our data model is pretty straightforward, DynamoDB is a good fit for us.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/deduplication.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/deduplication.png"></p>
<h3 id="performing-actions">Performing Actions</h3>
<p>Since we want to support workflows where a single trigger could lead to multiple actions, we will use SQS to decouple the trigger from the action.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lambda function which processes the trigger and if there are any actions to run, enqueue them to SQS.</li>
<li>Lambda function which runs the actions as a result of messages being enqueued to S3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the benefits of this architecture are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actions are isolated from each other. If one action fails, other actions won’t be affected. We could even use a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html">Dead-Letter queue</a> to debug and process failed actions.</li>
<li>Trigger and action are decoupled. Since there could be multiple actions that could take a variable amount of time, processing everything in a single Lambda function could lead to Lambda timeouts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/action.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/action.png"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>
<p>Now that we have a rough idea of how to build such a system, let’s look at what it will potentially cost us. I came up with a rough estimate of how this system would be used based on my current usage of Zapier:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run 5 workflows</strong>: 3 of them are webhooks based, the rest are polling-based. For simplicity, let’s assume each of these workflows have 2 actions.</li>
<li>The webhooks based workflows are triggered roughly 10 times a day. Thus, the total number of webhooks-based workflow executions would be <strong>30/day</strong>.</li>
<li>The polling workflows would run once <strong>every 12 hours</strong> and they would check for any new data in the API endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let’s look at the pricing of the various AWS services we are planning to use.</p>
<h3 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda has a pretty generous free tier which includes 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.</p>
<p>These are the Lambda functions that we currently have in the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: This function accepts any incoming webhooks and if a matching workflow exists, enqueues downstream tasks to SQS.</li>
<li>Polling Trigger: There are two lambda functions to support polling triggers. The first one runs once every 12 hours and enqueues any poll-based workflows whereas the second function runs once for each poll-based workflow and checks if any new data is available.</li>
<li>Actions: We run one Lambda function for every action in a workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our previous assumptions of usage, the number of Lambda requests we would have every month are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: 30 requests / day * 2 actions / workflow = 60 / day = 1800 / month</li>
<li>Polling: 2 requests / day + 2 workflows * 2 actions / workflow = 6 / day = 180 / month</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that our Lambda functions on average run for 30 seconds (probably much lower than this) and they take 1024 MB of memory.</p>
<p>Using these assumptions, our total compute will be (1024 MB * 30s * 1880 request) / 1024 = 56400 GB-seconds per month. We are under the free tier limit on Lambda.</p>
<p>Cost for Lambda (using free tier): <strong>$0 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Cost for Lambda (assuming we aren’t eligible for the free tier): $0.20 + <strong>56400 * $0.0000166667 = $ 1.14 / month</strong></p>
<h3 id="sqs">SQS</h3>
<p>Similar to Lambda, SQS also has a pretty generous free tier. The first 1 million monthly requests are free. Every API action counts as a request.</p>
<p>A rough estimate of the number of requests we would make to SQS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: For every webhooks request we get, we would enqueue the actions for the workflow to SQS. Then, Lambda functions which execute the actions would dequeue these actions and run them.</li>
<li>Polling-based: Every time a polling-based workflow is scheduled, we would first enqueue all the polling-based workflows into SQS. Then, a Lambda function would dequeue these workflows and then enqueue any actions in these workflows to a different SQS queue which would eventually get dequeued by the Lambda function which runs the actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the description above, the number of SQS requests we would make are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: 30 requests / day * 2 actions / workflow (enqueued) * 2 actions / workflow (dequeued) = 120 requests / day = 3600 requests / month</li>
<li>Polling-based: 2 requests / day * 2 polling-based workflows (enqueued) * 2 polling-based workflows (dequeued) * 2 actions / workflow (enqueued) * 2 actions / workflow (dequeued) = 32 requests / day = 960 requests / month</li>
</ul>
<p>Total number of requests to SQS in a month: ~5000 requests / month</p>
<p>Cost for SQS (regardless of tier): <strong>$0 / month</strong></p>
<h3 id="api-gateway">API Gateway</h3>
<p>The API Gateway will only be used by our webhooks workflows. Based on our assumptions above, we will make roughly 900 requests/month to our API Gateway.</p>
<p>Cost for API Gateway: <strong>~$0 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%201.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%201.png"></p>
<h3 id="dynamodb">DynamoDB</h3>
<p>DynamoDB has the most complicated pricing model out of all the services we are planning to use. More details about pricing is available <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We will be using DynamoDB only for polling-based workflows to ensure we can deduplicate any data.</p>
<p>The schema for our table would look like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span># primary_key
</span>    <span>"workflow_id"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"S"</span><span>:</span> <span>"my_workflow"</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>"processed_keys"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"SS"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"1234"</span><span>,</span> <span>"1235"</span><span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
<li>Primary key would be the name of the particular workflow</li>
<li>We would also store the set of processed unique identifiers for the data. For the sake of simplicity, we can assume these identifiers would be approximately <strong>10 characters</strong> in length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our usage model, we expect to make the following requests to DynamoDB:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read requests</strong>: 2 polling workflows * 2 triggers / day * 1 read request = 4 requests/day or 120 requests/month</li>
<li><strong>Write requests</strong>: A Write request would only be made when there is new data available in the API. Let’s assume we will have new data every time the workflow is triggered: 4 requests/day or 120 requests/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used this pricing calculator for DynamoDB and used conservative estimates that we calculated above.</p>
<p>Cost for Dynamo: ~<strong>0.50 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%202.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%202.png"></p>
<h3 id="total-cost">Total Cost</h3>
<p>If we assume that we are within the limits of the free tier usage for Lambda and SQS, this system will cost us ~<strong>$0.50 / month.</strong></p>
<p>If we include the cost for Lambda, our system will cost us <strong>~$1.64 / month</strong>.</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <section id="main_content">
        

<p>Some days back I assembled a top of the line(ish) workstation for working on hobby projects and gaming. I bought the latest and greatest processor (Ryzen 3900x - 12 Core 24 Threads) from AMD and 32 GB of RAM for a no-compromises experience. I assembled the PC and it was blazing fast. I configured the system to run Windows and Linux (PopOS) using dual booting. I already had an SSD from a previous build that had the Linux OS installed and configured. I had my Twitter crawls set up on it and other services set up and working on it. I used Linux for Productivity and Windows mostly gaming as is the custom.</p>

<p>After some time, I realized this arrangement came with a very obvious drawback. Whenever I used to game, my Twitter crawls and other services in Linux, were effectively shut down. To solve this issue, I changed the boot order to set the Linux OS to boot by default. Even then, I wasn’t ready to accept this tradeoff when I had a processor that was more than capable of handling both of these OSes at the same time. If I were to somehow manage, to virtualize the existing Linux installation I had, the CPU I bought wouldn’t even break sweat handling both my OSes at the same time. I am also lazy and found it very hard to switch off a running OS and switch to the other one frequently. I just wanted to reduce my overhead.</p>

<p>So summarizing the above, I wanted to boot the already existing Linux installation I had on a different SSD as a guest VM in windows. I already had a Windows 10 Professional version so, the choice of hypervisor was easy, as this particular version of Windows comes with Hyper-V. The challenge here is booting from an actual hard disk instead of a virtual hard disk. The problems with the above approach are</p>

<ol>
  <li>Passthrough the hard disk (having Linux installation) directly to the VM</li>
  <li>Boot from this hard disk by using virtualized GRUB media</li>
  <li>Solve other issues for smooth operation</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="enabling-virtualization-and-hyperv">Enabling virtualization and HyperV</h2>

<p>The first step in this process is to activate Virtualization features from the BIOS and enable it in Windows. In my case, it was a simple setting in BIOS called Secure Virtual Machine Mode (SVM) which when enabled allows you to use HyperV in Windows. Enabling HyperV in Windows is then straight forward. Follow the below steps to activate HyperV.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Search Windows Features in the Windows search bar.</li>
  <li>Click the checkbox near Hyper-V. Press OK and you should be done.</li>
  <li>Windows will restart once to enable this feature.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/enableHV.PNG" alt="EnableHyperV"></p>

<h2 id="passing-through-the-ssd-to-vm">Passing through the SSD to VM</h2>
<p>The next challenge here is to make sure the actual media (SSD in my case) is passed through without interference to the VM we create. You have to make sure Windows is not using this media and forwards it cleanly to our target VM.</p>
<h3 id="make-the-device-offline-in-windows">Make the device offline in Windows</h3>
<p>To make sure that the media we are passing to the new VM is not being used by the host OS, we need to make sure the disk is offline. You can do that by doing the following steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Disk Management tool by searching for it in the Windows search bar.</li>
  <li>All your disks should appear at the bottom along with all the partitions in the bottom.</li>
  <li>Go to the Linux media you want to forward (the drive which has Linux installed on it) and left-click on it. You’ll get an option to make this device offline, click on it. Now the disk should be offline and the UI should be reflecting the change.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/offlineHDD.PNG" alt="offlineHDD"></p>

<h3 id="create-a-vm-using-hyperv">Create a VM using HyperV</h3>
<p>Once you complete the above step, you need to create a VM using HyperV. Go to HyperV Manager and create a new VM. Create a new VM with all the necessary configurations like memory and CPU cores. While creating a new VM make sure that you select generation 2 (No specific reason just seems newer and better suited to me) in the Specify Generation section and in the Connect Virtual Hard disk section select the “Attach a Virtual Hard disk later” option. Once you do that your VM should be created. To mount our Linux media and make sure we can boot to it we need to do a device passthrough to the VM.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the settings of the newly created VM, under the SCSI controller section you need to add a Hard disk.</li>
  <li>In the media section your Linux HDD should show up under the Physical Hard disk section. Select the Hard disk and click apply.</li>
  <li>Mount any other disks if needed.</li>
  <li>Download the SuperGrub 2 disk image from <a href="https://www.supergrubdisk.org/super-grub2-disk/">here</a></li>
  <li>In the DVD drive under the SCSI section select the recently downloaded ISO as an image file. 
<img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/HDD.PNG" alt="VMHDDConfiguration"></li>
</ol>

<p>SuperGrub2 helps us to solve the issue of not finding the GRUB partition as we are booting in a VM. We use SuperGrub2 to boot into our Linux install.</p>

<p>Once you are done, keep the DVD drive boot priority highest.</p>

<h2 id="disable-snapshots">Disable Snapshots</h2>

<p>HyperV won’t allow you to boot the created VM as the HyperV Manager cannot create a snapshot. This is because our installation media is an actual HDD instead of a virtual one. You can disable Snapshotting by going to the VM settings -&gt; Management -&gt; Checkpoints and deselect the “Enable Checkpoints” check box.</p>

<h2 id="boot-into-the-linux-vm">Boot into the Linux VM</h2>

<p>Once you are done with the above steps you can spin up the VM and you should be able to boot into the SuperGrub Menu. In this menu select the “Detect and show boot methods” entry.</p>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/dualbootasVM/imagesgrub.PNG" alt="superGrub"></p>

<p>You should then be able to select your Linux version and be able to boot into it.</p>

<h2 id="configure-the-display-driver">Configure the display driver</h2>
<p>If you were using Nvidia proprietary drivers on the existing Linux installation you’ll need to remove them. Once you do that you need to install the xserver-xorg-video-fbdev package to make xorg server work.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>xserver-xorg-video-fbdev 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added an x11 configuration file which might or might not have helped. Adding it just in case this might help someone. Create a new file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-hyperv.conf and add the below snippet to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Section <span>"Device"</span>
 Identifier <span>"HYPER_V Framebuffer"</span>
 Driver <span>"fbdev"</span>
EndSection
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I wasn’t able to boot into the GUI (though CLI is still accessible) without the above fixes. Once you do that and reboot you should be able to boot into the Linux GUI.</p>



<p>Congratulations! you now have a Virtualized version of your Linux Installation which can be accessed inside your Windows OS. The advantage of this approach is you can still normally boot into the Linux OS and all your changes are consistent across both VM and the actual Linux system as the media is the same. The only problem I can see is enabling GPU drivers. In the future maybe I can dynamically switch the display drivers based on the context.</p>

<p>This method also won’t work if your Linux install exists on the same Hard disk. I feel in that case just converting the whole partition to a VHDX file would be easier. This method has its own drawbacks like the data won’t be consistent across both instances.</p>

					<div><p>PASK – Pianists for Alternatively Sized Keyboards – is an international movement committed to achieving change in relation to piano keyboard size.</p><p>Specifically, PASK aims to convince piano manufacturers to begin producing piano keyboards in three standard sizes. Purchasers of new pianos will then have a choice of keyboard size. In addition to the current ‘large’ size, we need two additional sizes with <u>narrower keys</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The current piano keyboard has prevailed since the 1880’s and was not designed for the physical capabilities of the population at large. It has been assumed that the current size is suitable for all, whereas in fact it is isn’t. The keys are too wide for the majority of pianists, considering men, women and children of all nationalities and across all age groups.</p><p>The current keyboard size and key width suits people with large hands, generally adult males with average to above average spans. However, for those with smaller hands, today’s piano increases technical difficulties and learning time. It limits musical expression and prevents access to a large amount of the piano repertoire. Worst of all, it can cause debilitating pain and injury.</p><p>A simple analogy illustrates the point. Does it make sense that all men in an athletics race should have to wear the same size shoes? And that female athletes have to run in the same size shoes as the men? And that children have to run in the same size shoes as adults?</p></div>

					<div><p>The<strong> long term goal of PASK </strong>is for acoustic and digital piano manufacturers to offer a choice of three standard keyboard sizes in accordance with the DS standards. These are: DS5.5® (7/8) and the DS6.0® (15/16) as well as the current ‘large’ DS6.5<em>&nbsp;</em>keyboard. They need to be&nbsp;mass-produced and marketed worldwide in such a way that the new alternative sizes are readily available and naturally accepted options for all pianists and teachers.&nbsp;</p><p>For this to happen, we need to focus on both building the demand from the piano world as well as encouraging supply from manufacturers. Clearly, these are interdependent.&nbsp;</p><p>Pianists with smaller hands must create a united voice and demand access to keyboards with narrower keys. Piano teachers, universities and conservatoriums need to recognise their benefits. Competitions and concert venues should provide a choice of keyboard for performers.</p><p>Alternatively sized keyboards are currently only available from a limited number of sources, are expensive and often involve long wait times for customers. The major piano manufacturers need to take up this challenge.&nbsp;A key factor in creating change will be public support from prominent pianists, academics and teachers around the world.</p><p>There are three main strategies required to achieve this goal:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raising awareness of the benefits of reduced size keyboards for those with smaller hands.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating opportunities for pianists to experience the difference in playing on narrower keys.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breaking down barriers and resistance to change.</p></div>

					<p>PASK is not a formally constituted organisation, but a network of people working towards a common goal.

There are three founders of PASK:

Ms Erica Booker from Sydney, Australia – Graduate of the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music, pianist and piano teacher. Erica is also a Suzuki teacher trainer and leading advocate for alternatively sized piano keyboards:<a href="https://ericabookerpiano.com/%E2%80%8B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://ericabookerpiano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ericabookerpiano.com</a>

Dr Carol Leone from Dallas, Texas – Chair of Keyboard Studies at SMU Meadows School of the Arts in Dallas, internationally recognized performing artist, teacher, lecturer, and author. Carol is one of the world’s leading researchers and proponents of ergonomic piano keyboards to promote a pianist’s wellness:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.carolleone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.carolleone.com</a>

Ms Rhonda Boyle from Melbourne, Australia – Former government policy analyst/strategic planner with qualifications in physics, environmental science and urban planning. Rhonda is a pianist, independent researcher and author of peer-reviewed articles relating to hand size and piano playing:

<span>These three founders have no financial connections with any piano or keyboard manufacturers.</span>

The PASK network is gradually growing and now includes many others around the world who support the PASK goals and who are actively engaged in encouraging change.

					<div><p>The term ESPK (ergonomically scaled piano keyboard) is now mostly used in the academic community when referring to keyboards smaller than the current ‘standard’ size i.e., with 6.5 inch octave. The term ‘reduced-size keyboard’ has also been used in some literature. &nbsp;Also note that the DS5.5®<em>&nbsp;</em>is often referred to as the ‘7/8 keyboard’ as the key widths are close to (but not exactly) 7/8 of the ‘standard’ keyboard. Likewise, the DS6.0®<em>&nbsp;</em>is often referred to as the 15/16 keyboard. ESPK is a generic term that also includes keyboards of other sizes, i.e. that do not conform to the DS standards.&nbsp;</p><p>The ‘DS’ abbreviation stands for Donison-Steinbuhler. (Chris Donison and David Steinbuhler pioneered the introduction of piano keyboards with narrower keys for acoustic pianos, mainly in North America.) &nbsp;The PASK movement (Pianists for Alternatively Sized Keyboards) generally uses the term ‘alternative sizes’ to avoid confusion as ‘reduced size’ could imply fewer than 88 keys.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

      <p><i>4<sup>th</sup> November, 2016</i></p>

      <p>
	<q>SVG 2 is on life support.</q>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
	About a month ago the W3C's SVG staff contact person (Doug
	Schepers) relayed some very alarming news... that the SVG
	Working Group charter was not going to be renewed when it
	expired at the end of October, 2016. This was quite shocking
	as the group had worked quite hard to get the SVG 2
	specification to
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#Reports"><i>Candidate
	Recommendation</i></a> status. If the charter is not renewed,
	it would mean <span>an immediate end to
	SVG 2</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
	While shocking and unexpected, it didn't come out of left field.
	The active participation in the working group has dropped to
	just a handful of people, none representing any of the browser
	vendors. In fact, the last two "face-to-face" meetings had
	attendance of just three regular participants, one from Canon
	(which is dropping membership in the W3C as the end of the year)
	and two <q>invited experts</q> who are working for free. The weekly
	teleconferences were down to four or five participants (with
	representatives from KDDI and the W3C).
      </p>

      <h2>Recent Developments</h2>

      <p>
	The working group appealed to the browser vendors for support
	in renewing the charter. A teleconference was organized with
	multiple representatives from each of the major browser
	vendors as well as a number of other interested parties
	(Adobe, Canon, KDDI, etc.). The general consensus from the
	browser vendors is that SVG 2 should be finished but that it
	should be restricted to <q>fixing</q> the problems with SVG
	1.1 2nd edition along with a few choice selected new features
	(like 'paint-order') which have already been implemented by
	multiple browsers. <span>New features
	(meshes, hatches, etc.) should be removed and pushed into
	a <a href="https://wicg.io/">WICG group</a>.</span> (Wrapped
	text was not discussed.) (See
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/10/06-svg-minutes.html">minutes</a>.)
	A resolution was made to <q>Re-charter SVG WG for one more year
	with a focus on moving SVG 2 to REC with only the features that
	have implementer experience.</q> Note that this is a WG resolution
	and not a W3C agreement to continue the group.
      </p>
      <p>
	With a focus on a limited SVG 2 specification, the W3C has
	agreed to extend the current SVG Working Group charter until the
	end of January in order to give the group a chance to sort out a
	new charter. Any new charter will focus on completing SVG 2 by
	developing a test suite and in pushing for implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
	An additional discussion by the WG was that all joint CSS/SVG
	specifications will be completely taken over by CSS. This
	includes
	<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/">Transforms</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/filters/">Filters</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/css-masking-1/">Masking and Clipping</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing-1/">Compositing and Blending</a>,
	etc. This completes the long process of CSS
	<span>stealing</span>
	absorbing the most interesting SVG features.
      </p>

      <h2>Future</h2>

      <p>
	The future is pretty cloudy at the moment. Here are some observations:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    There are only two browser implementations of importance:
	    Blink (Chrome/Opera) and Gecko (Firefox). Of these, only
	    Blink has the resources to fully implement new features
	    quickly although Gecko has implemented more of SVG
	    2. Chrome commands a huge lead in browser market share
	    (almost 75%). Google has a habit of unilaterally removing
	    features it doesn't like from Blink, basically dictating
	    that those features are removed from specifications.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Two other significant browser implementations, WebKit
	    (Safari) and Edge, are more followers than leaders and
	    have relatively little market share (5% and 4%
	    respectively).  For example, Microsoft explicitly stated
	    that they would not even look at SVG 2 until the
	    specification was a Candidate Recommendation (while the
	    other browser vendors have implemented a limited set of
	    SVG 2 features such as 'paint-order', see
	    <a href="https://nikosandronikos.github.io/svg2-info/svg2-feature-support/">SVG
	    2 Feature Support</a> for current status of SVG 2
	    implementation).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    There seems to be a disconnect between the browser vendors
	    and the content creators. Even Adobe has expressed
	    frustrations with the current status (and they have
	    significantly reduced their involvement with W3C as a
	    result).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Moving things into a WICG is not a viable strategy.
	    Without browser vendor buy-in, things are likely to never
	    emerge from a WICG group. In addition, a WICG group is
	    intended to develop new ideas to the point where the
	    browser vendors can have a look at them. Both meshes and
	    hatches are already well developed with Inkscape
	    supporting full rendering for several years. (Note that
	    the browsers already have code to render meshes as they
	    all support meshes in PDF.)
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Despite the large turnout for the SVG WG meeting where we
	    discussed the future of SVG 2, we have received almost no
	    feedback (after requesting it several times) from the
	    browser vendors on which SVG 2 features they are likely to
	    implement. This seems to be indicative of the low interest
	    they have in implementing SVG 2.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Even the CSS working group, which has a much larger active
	    participation, is having trouble getting their specifications
	    out. Both SVG and CSS seem to be <q>passé</q>. The new
	    darling of the browser vendor set is
	    <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/houdini-maybe-the-most-exciting-development-in-css-youve-never-heard-of/">Houdini</a> which offers lower level
	    access to browser internals. This is not unexpected as
	    browsers continue on the path to being the new OS.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    The most important long term observation is that browser
	    vendors respond to demand. I've been told SVG would never
	    have been part of HTML5 if it wasn't for Inkscape which
	    allowed the production of tons of SVG's used in the
	    Wikipedia. Browser vendors keep track of the use of
	    various features. <span>Features with
	    more use get more attention.</span>
	  </p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What should Inkscape do?</h3>

      <p>
	Given the above observations, if we really want mesh, hatches,
	etc. to remain part of SVG 2 and to be supported by
	browsers <span>we must generate content that
	uses those features</span>; content that gets people excited
	enough to put pressure on the browser vendors to implement
	them.  We've already started to do this in a limited way by
	enabling the use of 'paint-order' which is supported by three
	of the four major browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
	Of course this means that some artwork created using Inkscape
	won't be viewable directly on the web. We should accept this
	as a necessary (and hopefully temporary) step. We can provide
	warnings in Inkscape when artists use features that are not
	widely supported. We can advise artists of work-arounds, i.e.
	converting a mesh to an internal image when exporting. And we
	can provide
	<q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">polyfills</a></q>
	that replace internal browser functionality with JavaScript
	implementations. (I've already started work on a mesh gradient
	polyfill.)
      </p>
      <p>
	I've been working on improvements to the mesh gradient
	GUI. This work has been back-ported to 0.92. We plan on
	enabling mesh gradients by default in the 0.92 release. This
	will start generating public content that uses mesh gradients.

<h2>Backbone of Functional Programming</h2>
<p><code>map</code> &amp; <code>flatmap</code> form the backbone of Functional Progamming. It is very important be comfortable with these two concepts and this guide will help you develop an intuition for them.</p>
<p>This guide is language agnostic but I expect you to be familiar with basic programming concepts like functions, types, data type/objects and list. </p>
<h3>Nomenclature</h3>
<p>Let me introduce you to some basic terms we will be using to talk about <code>map/flatmap</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Type</code>s are data constructs and they can be <code>Basic Types</code> like Int, String etc.</li>
<li>
<code>Container</code> is a special <code>type</code> which contains another <code>type</code>. For example a List of Ints.</li>
<li>
<code>Function</code> is a function whose input is of Type 1 and output is of Type 2. Type 1 &amp; Type 2 can be same type.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visualize</h3>
<p>Though I have defined three terms it will be easier to think about them visually.</p>
<h4>
<code>Basic types</code> (Int, String etc) will be represented by shapes</h4>
<p><img alt="Basic Types" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/basic-types.png">.</p>

<hr>
<h4>
<code>Containers</code> will be represented by shapes</h4>
<p><img alt="Empty Containers" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/empty-containers.png"></p>
<p>In reality, we will always use</p>
<h4><code>Container for a Type</code></h4>
<p><img alt="Square for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/full-containers.png"></p>
<p>etc.</p>
<h4>
<code>Functions</code> will be denoted as</h4>
<p><img alt="f : Triangle -> Star" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/fun.png"></p>
<h3>Verbalize</h3>
<p>Let's see how to verbalize these terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Square for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/t-sq.png"> Container for Triangle</p>
<p><img alt="Square for Circle for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/t-crl-sq.png"> Square for Circle for Triangle</p>
<p><img alt="f : Triangle -> Star" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/fun.png">  f is a function from Triangle to Star</p>
<p><img alt="g : Triangle -> Square for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/g-fun.png"> g is a function from Triangle to Container of Triangle</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Fundamentals</h2>
<p>In this section, I want to introduce one basic concept along with <code>map/flatmap</code>.</p>
<h3>Function Composition</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Function Composition</code> is chaining two or more functions such that output of one function feeds into to the input of second function and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Derivation of g . f : Triangle to Container of Reverse Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/gof-derive.png"></p>
<h3><code>map</code></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>map</code> is a function that takes a Container (C1) &amp; a Function (F) as input and returns a new Container (C2) for Function's (F) output type.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Rules for <code>map</code>
</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Type contained by Container (C1) has to match Function's (F) input type.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="map : (f : Triangle -> Reverse Triangle, Container for Triangle) -> Container for Reverse Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/map.png"></p>
<h3><code>flatmap</code></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>flatmap</code> is a function that takes a Container (C1) &amp; a Function (F) as input and returns a new Container (C2) for Function's (F) output type.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Rules for <code>flatmap</code>
</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Type contained by Container (C1) has to match Function's (F) input type.</li>
<li>Function (F) has to return a Container (C2)</li>
<li>C1 == C2. This is very important to remember as many people trip up on this.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="flatmap : (f : Triangle -> Container for Reverse Triangle, Container for Triangle) -> Container for Reverse Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/flatmap.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As you can see, both <code>map</code> &amp; <code>flatmap</code> have the same written definition but the strictness is in the rules it has to adhere to.</p>
</blockquote>

<strong>FreeBSD - a lesson in poor defaults</strong>
<hr>

<p>
Last updated: 09/25/2020. 
<small><a href="https://twitter.com/blakkheim">@blakkheim</a></small>

</p><p>
This page lists some of the changes I make to a vanilla install of FreeBSD
for security hardening. Some changes to increase network performance or make
things a bit more more sane are also included. It only covers basic changes
that a sysadmin can make to a running system.

</p><p>
It could also be considered a commentary piece on the state of security in
FreeBSD's development ecosystem, highlighting their strong resistance to
change and unwillingness to replace old cruft with modern alternatives.

</p><p>
The project's
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/security.html">security page</a>
says the following:

</p><blockquote><em>
FreeBSD takes security very seriously and its developers are constantly
working on making the operating system as secure as possible.
</em></blockquote>

<p>
But is that really true? Let's find out.

<h2 id="openssh">OpenSSH Modifications</h2>

FreeBSD has a history of making "interesting" choices with regard to the
version of OpenSSH they bundle in the base system, often deliberately going
against upstream in the name of retaining backward compatibility or to gain
perceived performance improvements. Disabling or ignoring security features
in favor of performance seems to be a recurring theme, as we'll see later on.

<p>
It is my belief that quite a few poor decisions have been made in this area.
As a primary example, they insisted on maintaining the
<a href="https://www.psc.edu/hpn-ssh">HPN-SSH</a> patchset and enabling it
by default for quite a long time.

</p><p>
You might say "Well OK, but what's actually <em>wrong</em> with those patches?"

</p><p>
OpenSSH increased the channel limits enough to support a cross-country gigabit
connection without slowdown years ago. For most users, this means that the HPN
patches are an unnecessary complexity with little or no benefit. In addition
to that, they would frequently hold FreeBSD back from updating their version
of OpenSSH because of HPN backporting and manual refactoring of the patchset.

</p><p>
Support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Wrappers">tcp_wrappers</a>
was abandoned long ago in OpenSSH upstream, but FreeBSD still
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=294328">patched it back in</a> and enabled it for everyone.

</p><p>
The same was true for weak DSA host keys, which they
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=294495">switched back on</a> for compatibility with older clients.

</p><p>
FreeBSD also
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=296634">re-enabled</a>
insecure encryption ciphers in their build after they were disabled upstream,
with backward compatibility apparently being more important to them than the
security of their users.

</p><p>
If we don't deprecate insecure options bit by bit somewhere in the ecosystem,
we end up with a situation like OpenSSL. Pressure has to be applied somewhere.
One can be part of that team, or one can play against them. In this case,
FreeBSD is the team trying to increase the risk.

</p><p>
They've made local changes to their OpenSSH build and its default config files
that left their users vulnerable when other platforms were unaffected. Here's
a (possibly incomplete) list of examples:

</p><ul>

<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16:14.openssh.asc">FreeBSD-SA-16:14.openssh</a>
</li></ul>

<p>
And the PAM issues in these two:

<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-15:22.openssh.asc">FreeBSD-SA-15:22.openssh</a>
</li></ul>

<p>
A list of FreeBSD's modifications to both the code and config files can be
seen
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/crypto/openssh/FREEBSD-upgrade?view=markup#l93">here</a>
for the base system (possibly outdated/unmaintained) and 
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/openssh-portable/files">here</a>
for the ports version.

</p><p>
Thankfully, as hinted above, it's fairly easy to install OpenSSH from ports
with all the FreeBSDisms removed. Their
<a href="https://www.freshports.org/security/openssh-portable">openssh-portable</a>
port has a hefty set of options you can toggle:

</p><pre>BLACKLISTD      FreeBSD blacklistd(8) support
BSM             OpenBSM Auditing
DOCS            Build and/or install documentation
FIDO_U2F        FIDO/U2F support (security/libfido2)
HPN             HPN-SSH patch
KERB_GSSAPI     Kerberos/GSSAPI patch (req: GSSAPI)
LDNS            SSHFP/LDNS support
LIBEDIT         Command line editing via libedit
NONECIPHER      NONE Cipher support
PAM             Pluggable authentication module support
TCP_WRAPPERS    tcp_wrappers support
XMSS            XMSS key support (experimental)
MIT             MIT Kerberos (security/krb5)
HEIMDAL         Heimdal Kerberos (security/heimdal)
HEIMDAL_BASE    Heimdal Kerberos (base)
</pre>

<p>
Besides the modifications mentioned above, two other patches in particular
have been popular with FreeBSD users: threaded AES-CTR and the "NONE" cipher.

</p><p>
Threaded AES-CTR, as the name might imply, introduces threads to the code.
OpenSSH developerss have publicly said threads are too risky and won't be
added. What's more, it's largely obsoleted by AES-NI in modern CPUs and the
fact that ChaCha20-Poly1305 (the current default cipher) is even faster
when taking the message authentication code (MAC) into consideration.

</p><p>
The NONE cipher is somewhat of a misfeature, removing the encryption bits
and only keeping the data integrity. It allows users to accidentally shoot
themselves in the foot pretty easily. The trade-off in performance isn't
really worth it either, as the bottlenecks one might experience have a lot
more to do with the MAC than the actual encryption overhead.

</p><p>
I recommend disabling all of the port options. The majority of users don't
need the extra risk that any of these non-standard patches introduce.

</p><p>
As for the <code>/usr/local/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file, I would recommend
enabling only modern crypto. However, cryptography is a very complicated and
important topic, so you would be better served to research each algorithm and
come to your own conclusions instead of just taking my word. Thankfully,
upstream OpenSSH cares about security and continues to remove old, broken
algorithms as time goes on. FreeBSD can't keep patching them back in and
maintaining their backports. It's simply too much work.

</p><p>
This isn't meant to be an entire SSH tutorial, but consider changing your
default port to something other than 22 if you want less spam in your logs,
set up public keys and disable password authentication... the usual stuff.

</p><p>
The following config lines are just to revert FreeBSD's local changes that
introduce new risks:

</p><pre>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no         
UsePAM                          no 
VersionAddendum                 none  # Prevent some OS information from being
                                      # leaked by your sshd, another one of
                                      # FreeBSD's "enhancements" in both the
                                      # base system and ports version.
X11Forwarding                   no        
</pre>

<p>
In addition to improved security, using the port of OpenSSH allows you to
upgrade to newer versions much faster than waiting for a new release of the
base system. As an example, FreeBSD has comically been limited to "upgrading"
their base OpenSSH to a release that's
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=357926">three versions behind the current one at the time</a>
because of their local patches. Note that you may need further configuration
changes if using the bundled OpenSSH, as its options aren't as easily fixable.

</p><h2 id="mail">Mailer Daemon</h2>

FreeBSD includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail">Sendmail</a>
in the base system and enables it by default.

<p>
I'd like to share a quote from one of the earliest security advisories FreeBSD
ever published:

</p><blockquote><em>
The sendmail mail transfer agent has a rather poor reputation
for security related problems.  FreeBSD ships a version of
sendmail that has all known security problems fixed, but this
doesn't mean there won't be more found in the future.
</em></blockquote>

And it turns out whoever wrote that
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-96:03.sendmail-suggestion.asc">back in 1996</a>
wasn't wrong.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-01:57.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-01:57.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:04.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:04.sendmail</a>

</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:11.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:11.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:13.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:13.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:13.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:13.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:17.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:17.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-14:11.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-14:11.sendmail</a>
</li></ul>

There are
<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/31/Sendmail.html">many more</a>
where those came from.

<p>
Even with Sendmail's reputation, FreeBSD has kept it around and left it on
by default for all their users.

</p><p>
To make matters worse, FreeBSD sometimes imports
<a href="https://marc.info/?l=sendmail-announce&amp;m=159394546814125&amp;w=2">sendmail updates</a>
with
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=363233">no mention</a>
of the included security fixes. As you might guess, this means no advisory
is published, and most users don't get those security fixes for a long time,

</p><p>
I think most users will agree that this old program is mostly just a bother.
A full mail server, especially one that's been full of holes since the 90s,
shouldn't be in the base system at all if you ask me. Something simple for
local mail delivery should be enough.

</p><p>
I stop all the related services because it makes startup slower and I'd like
as few things running in the background as possible. The lines needed to
disable Sendmail will be in the rc.conf section later on.

</p><p>
If you actually run a mail server, there are better options like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix_(software)">Postfix</a> or
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/opensmtpd">OpenSMTPD</a>.
If you only need to send mail through a third party provider like
Gmail, <a href="https://marlam.de/msmtp/">msmtp</a> is a another
lightweight alternative. All three are in ports.

</p><h2 id="firewall">Firewall</h2>

There are three firewalls included with FreeBSD: IPFW, PF, and IPFilter.
None of them are enabled by default.

<p>
I don't know anything about IPFilter, nor do I know anyone that uses it,
so we'll pretend it doesn't exist. IPFW is the native firewall.
It was written by FreeBSD, for FreeBSD, with their usual coding standards.

PF is the OpenBSD firewall. It was ported from OpenBSD to FreeBSD. Which one
you use mostly comes down to preference. Since I'm more familiar with PF,
that's what I use. Unfortunately, the version of PF included with FreeBSD
hasn't been synced with upstream <strong>since 2009</strong>. Do you want
such a critical component of your OS or network device left largely
unmaintained?

</p><p>
Check the documentation for whichever firewall you decide to use for proper
configuration instructions.

</p><h2 id="portspkg">Ports and Packages</h2>

Other than just manually compiling things yourself, there are three main ways
to install software on FreeBSD:

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg">pkg</a> tool (with binary packages built by the project infrastructure)
</li><li>The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html">ports</a> system, allowing for custom options in many applications

        <p>
            <cite><a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/">Tom Ryder</a></cite>, 27 Oct 2017<br>
            Last updated 12 October 2019
        </p>
        <p>
            I host all my own code on my <a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/">cgit instance</a>. I do have <a href="https://github.com/tejr">an account on GitHub</a>, but only because it’s a requirement to contribute to certain projects and even to log into some websites. I avoid using the account where possible, and I don’t host code on it anymore since June 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary reason I host code on my own domain is a practical one: I can retain control over its location via <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> redirects if it needs to move, including redirects to another site if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I also dislike the tacit acceptance of GitHub as the dominant free software hosting platform for a decentralised version control protocol, when it is itself centralised, proprietary, for-profit, closed-source, and politically active. These things make it vulnerable to the same issues and abuse that affected <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/sourceforge-grabs-gimp-for-windows-account-wraps-installer-in-bundle-pushing-adware/">SourceForge</a>. I feel that the free software and open source communities turn a blind eye to this massive liability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of your position on individual cases, the fact that so much controversy results from any censorship activity from GitHub should be considered a warning sign that too much depends on their service. Some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151208143727/https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941">https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941</a> [archive]
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/12/19/feminist_software_foundation_c_plus_equality/">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/12/19/feminist_software_foundation_c_plus_equality/</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150802/20330431831/github-nukes-repository-over-use-word-retard.shtml">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150802/20330431831/github-nukes-repository-over-use-word-retard.shtml</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The issue here is not political correctness, it’s centralisation. If GitHub were not in this monopolistic position, nobody would care so much about any of the above.  The overwhelming monopoly that GitHub has as a code host is a problem that the free software community chooses to ignore.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Rules of acquisition
        </h2>
        <p>
            GitHub has investors who do not care a whit for free software principles, and eventually <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-03/microsoft-is-said-to-have-agreed-to-acquire-coding-site-github">the company <em>will</em> get acquired</a>—maybe tomorrow, maybe next year—and as we all know, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLWbp3w2eqM">money changes everything</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don’t leave your project’s nerve center—its primary address, its means of contribution, its issue tracker, its website, its primary documentation, its continuous integration, everything—in a way you can’t redirect!—at the mercy of people who merely want a return on their investment, and do not care about the principles of a minority of angry nerds.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Using Git does not require GitHub!
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you are managing a free software project, <em>please do not host it on GitHub</em>, or at least allow a method of contributing that does not depend on using it or any other proprietary code hosting platform:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>
                Formatting and sending patches:
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Use <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email">git-send-email(1)</a>. The manual page even has instructions for using it with Gmail. Using this method, you don’t need to host the code at all.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                Pull requests:
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Host your own repositories—<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/no-nb/v1/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols#The-HTTP/S-Protocol">it’s really easy</a>—and point maintainers to them with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull">git-request-pull(1)</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                Web frontend:
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Use the superb <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/">cgit</a>, or <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitweb">gitweb(1)</a>, which is included in the Git source. Both are straightforward to configure for any <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr>-capable webserver.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Other options include a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/install/">self-hosted GitLab</a>, <a href="https://gogs.io/docs/installation">Gogs</a>, <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a>, or <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a> instance.  More ambitious or puritan sysadmins might choose to self-host Drew DeVault’s stellar <a href="https://meta.sr.ht/">sr.ht</a> system, which implements a much wider range of GitHub’s features, for an “integrated development hosting” environment.

        <p>
            Since this page was published, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/">Microsoft has acquired GitHub</a>, and there’s been a small exodus to third-party hosting on GitLab, proving as a community we still aren’t really learning our lesson about third-party code hosting. That said, at least the core software for GitLab is open source, so it’s a marginal improvement, but we could be doing so much better.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re reading this because you’re angry about the acquisition and pondering a move to GitLab, I advise you instead to take the plunge and self-host your code repositories, even if you use the resource-hungry GitLab to do it. It is not as hard as you think, and once done, this problem will never bite you again.

            <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-starts-blocking-developers-in-countries-facing-us-trade-sanctions/">GitHub is blocking</a> users from Crimea, Iran, and other places.  For developers dependent on it as a service for their projects, this has been crippling, in yet another vindication for the decentralized design of Git that GitHub and other third-party hosting sites have so callously butchered.

            Hello, <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/s0s8fu/why_not_github">visitors from lobste.rs</a>!  Thank you for your discussion and critique.  I’ve added mention of the excellent-looking Gogs, Gerritt, and Gitea, and adjusted some wording for accuracy and clarity.

        <p>
            To emphasise: nothing in this essay is intended as praise or criticism specifically of social justice, advocacy for protected groups, censorship, United States foreign policy, or its <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-and-trade-controls">effect on GitHub specifically</a>—they have to follow the law, like anyone else.  The focus here is on centralisation onto a commercial service, running proprietary code, subject to the laws of a single country, that already has a monopoly on code hosting for free and open source software, and the free software community’s wilfully ignoring the issues therewith.

            It’s become more widely known that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation">GitHub had a contract with United States Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a>, an ethical hot-topic at present after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/chef-ceo-says-hell-continue-to-work-with-ice-in-spite-of-protests/">similar disputes with config management software Chef</a>.  Again, the issue here is not whether this is good or bad, it’s that you’re handing GitHub power over your work, while they may be using their proprietary software to political ends that you find repugnant, and refusing you the right to fork and apply their code in the way that suits you, the user.  Avoiding these sorts of problems is the entire basis of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Freedom 0</a>.

November 21, 2020 | http://blog.benwiener.com/economics/2020/11/19/vaccine-delays.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://blog.benwiener.com/economics/2020/11/19/vaccine-delays.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I keep hearing about small delays in the vaccine development process that I don’t understand given how urgent the need is. I read a perfect example today. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html">A New York Times article</a> sharing good news about the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine mentioned that the company would be applying for emergency use authorization “within days”. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/health/Covid-moderna-vaccine.html%22">A similar article</a> cited a period of weeks for the Moderna vaccine. This progress is great news. It made me wonder, though, why not today? What prevented these companies from being ready to file with the FDA right away?</p>

<p>By all accounts, the rapid progress of COVID-19 vaccine candidates has been miraculous. Still, I’m confused by the apparent lack of urgency in certain parts of the process. Most of the vaccine development work is probably difficult to speed up. For example, it isn’t possible to speed up the rate at which trial participants get exposed to the virus so that effectiveness can be proven<sup id="fnref:hcc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hcc">1</a></sup>. But what prevents Pfizer and Moderna from pre-writing their application to the FDA while the trial is running and netting a few days or weeks? Even just a few days has serious value. Of course, the data is still coming in so there would be some uncertainty about what should be written in the application. But they must have a pretty good sense of how the trial is going. They could even pre-write two or three versions to cover the most likely scenarios. And of all possible trial outcomes, why would these companies both be unprepared for best-case scenarios where their vaccines are proving to be highly effective?</p>

<p>Getting a bit more speculative, why aren’t scientists at Pfizer and Moderna already in conversation with decision makers at the FDA so that the evaluation process can be started based on preliminary data? Then they could be possibly be ready to issue emergency use authorization immediately once the trial concludes. If there is an unexpected change in the latest data regulators should of course be prepared to reassess. To be clear, I am not suggesting that the approval process be less rigorous. I just want it happening in parallel with the trial as much as it can. Given how ridiculously destructive this pandemic is, I sure hope COVID vaccines are the FDA’s top priority.</p>

<p>This possibility reminds me of the mechanics of my thesis defense. My adviser, the main decision maker, was already very familiar with my work. Little information was actually transmitted to him that day. He already knew what he needed to know to make his decision. In fact, we wouldn’t have even gone forward with the defense if he wasn’t ready to pass me. He didn’t take a month after the defense to closely read my thesis, consider all the arguments, check the math, and then deliberate. That process occurred while the data was coming in. Maybe some parallelization of the approval process like this is happening for the COVID vaccines, but I’ve never read anything that gives the sense that it is.</p>

<h3 id="possible-answers-to-my-own-questions">Possible answers to my own questions:</h3>
<h4 id="why-werent-the-eua-applications-ready">Why weren’t the EUA applications ready?</h4>

<p>Maybe a document like this is <em>way</em> more complicated than I’m imagining and the drug companies are writing them as fast as possible. This sort of suggests that writing the application is a similar challenge to developing the vaccine. I hope that’s not right.</p>

<p>Maybe the drug companies <em>are</em> already working with the FDA, and the timing of the application isn’t important. As I mentioned above, I’ve never seen anything that suggests this.</p>

<p>Maybe these companies aren’t incentivized to actually get the vaccine to market as fast as they can. Off the bat this didn’t seem right to me, but could the advance purchase agreements that Moderna and Pfizer signed with governments eliminate their urgency?</p>

<h4 id="why-arent-the-drug-companies-working-with-the-fda">Why aren’t the drug companies working with the FDA?</h4>

<p>Maybe this just isn’t the way the FDA usually works and they weren’t able to adapt to this extraordinary situation.</p>

<p>Obviously scientific integrity is important here. Maybe the scientists are intentionally kept separate from other parts of Pfizer and from the FDA to prevent some kind of academic dishonesty. I wonder about the relative dangers involved, but I could imagine an explanation like this.</p>

<h3 id="answers-that-other-people-have-suggested">Answers that other people have suggested:</h3>

<p>Commenters on Hacker News and Reddit have suggested that the things I want to happen are already happening. I’ve looked into this a little bit, and I’m unsure. Both Moderna and Pfizer have been granted the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">Fast Track status</a>. This sounds great. It apparently means these companies have the opportunity for closer collaboration with the FDA, at least on clinical trial design. Some have suggested that the companies would also already be sharing advance results from their studies, but I haven’t found any reference saying that.</p>

<p>Fast Track also gives them the opportunity to participate in Rolling Review, which allows them to submit sections of their applications as they become ready. The references I’ve found discussing this are mostly <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-emergency-use-authorization">press releases by the companies</a> or closely based on them. They discuss participation in Rolling Review in Europe and elsewhere, but I haven’t seen that they are doing this in the US.</p>

        <p><span>After Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple
        in 1985, everyone wanted to know what Steve would do
        next.... so NeXT was what he did.
        <p>
        
        In 1988 his NeXT team launched a new kind of computer for
        it's time, built on standards with a Unix core but with a
        user experience "my grandma could understand". It was well
        ahead of it's time, so naturally, it was not embraced by
        main stream consumers... a classic "Crossing the Chasm"
        issue. But many saw it for what it was, a breakthrough
        product as innovative as today's iTunes, iPod and iPhone.
        </p><p>
        
        Building upon NeXT's hardware and more importantly, their
        software development environment, many third party NeXT
        developers added their own magic dust to create
        revolutionary products, like the world's first web browser,
        or a new form of spread sheet, Lotus Improv or WebObjects,
        the foundation upon which the iTune store is built, to name
        only a few. Some of these ground breaking products may
        never be repeated. Most contained innovations embraced by
        future applications, with a clear lineage back to NeXTSTEP.
        </p><p>
        
        During the relatively short time of NeXT ascendency
        (1985-1996), Apple was bleeding red ink from repeated
        financial losses and two hugely expensive attempts to
        create a follow on Operating System. Apple's third
        president since Steve's departure, Gil Amelio saw the
        merits of Steve, his team and their technology. In December
        1996 Apple bought Next. Then the Next team took over Apple.
        The result is their hugely successful Mac OS X, built on
        the foundations of the NeXTSTEP OS.
        </p><p>
        
        While NeXT is no more, as a product or a stand alone
        company, it's impact on the industry will be felt for years
        to come. We should remember it, perhaps even study it. In
        decades to come, it will be understood as a watershed of
        innovation. Current Mac and iPhone users will be astonished
        to see how many of their beloved Mac OS X innovations had
        their roots in NeXTSTEP. There are many lessons about
        product innovation, market acceptance, and the creative
        people involved, that have yet to be uncovered.
        </p><p>
        
        This web site details part of our unique collection of NeXT
        related products and assorted items which grew up around
        NeXT Computer ecosystem, including of course NeXT hardware
        but also those rare items such as dealer sales kits, logo'd
        clothing, NeXT jewelry, banners, training tapes for
        servicing NeXT computers and printers, developer guides,
        plus third party software and hardware products.
        </p><p>
        
        While the site describes only part of the actual
        collection, the site does cover over 800 NeXT and third
        party products, many with multipage brochures and white
        papers. If you were to print all the html and PDF documents
        it would be over 3,000 pages.
        </p><p>
        
        This site describes what may well be the most extensive
        NeXT related collection available today.
        </p><p>
        
        It's history worth preserving.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8dc0160ef5e99c2bfb45abd90770b186e2eba397/318dd/img/what-i-wish-i-knew-as-a-junior-dev.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I've been a developer for over fifteen years and I've loved almost every minute of it. I can't imagine doing anything different but there are moments when I think back to starting out and how different the development landscape was, especially when it comes to learning how to code.</p>
<p>I'm really <em>not</em> that old, but things in the tech world move fast and there weren't as many resources around to help people get into frontend development and learn how to build something from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. There wasn't as many great communitys like Dev or Hashnode or WeStryve, not learning platforms such as Free Code Camp or The Odin Project.</p>
<p>So a lot of my early career felt like fumbling around for me, picking up everything I could from senior developers, hoping that they knew what they were doing, reading as many books as a I could and practicing my craft.</p>
<p>It's fair to say there were quite a few things I wish I'd known a lot earlier in my career that could have helped me progress faster or just develop both my coding skills, as well as my more complimentary skills, such as dealing with people or learning <em>how</em> to learn.</p>
<p>Hopefully, with this article I can distill what I've learned to date and share some things to watch out for and take on board to help you with your career as a frontend developer.</p>
<p><em>(Pssst -- If you like this article, come</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/kendalmintcode"><em>find me on Twitter</em></a> <em>where I post regular helpful content every day)</em></p>
<h2>Start writing a blog</h2>
<p>This very blog you're reading now (whether it's on my own website or my Dev or Hashnode accounts) has grown quite popular and that's great. But I really wish I'd started much earlier and written more frequently.</p>
<p>Honestly, blogging is such a great way to cement what you've learned <em>as you're learning it</em>. You absolutely do not have to be a developer with X years in the business, nor do you have to be an expert.</p>
<p>All you need is a curios mind and to think about writing for your past self: write the article you wish you'd had on the subject.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/551d70ccb71c4ae17340ca3c67475fe0bb796b93/cc36f/img/workplace-2303851_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As a bonus, if you fix something particularly tricky, you'll be able to refer back to your own article to help you solve it in the future!</p>
<p>My friend Catlin Pit has a couple of recommended articles on blogging too:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://catalins.tech/should-you-start-a-blog-as-a-developer" title="Catlin Pit's article on starting a developer blog">Should you start a blog as a developer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://catalins.tech/how-to-start-your-blog-as-a-developer" title="Catalin Pit's article on how to start a blog">How to start a blog</a> - a common question after 'what do I write about?'</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ask more questions!</h2>
<p>This seems obvious, but in my experience it's really not. A lot of developers, especially those early on in their careers are easily intimidated by more experienced devs or just those that have been around longer, and this can prevent them from speaking up.</p>
<p>But you know what? That's how you learn: you ask questions, you get answers (and, back to the previous point, you now have content for a blog article!).</p>
<p>Never be afraid of asking questions, especially if you're stuck on something. There are no stupid questions, but I'm not going to lie, you will at some point come across arrogant or unhelpful people who will make you feel otherwise. My advice, ignore them and find more open and helpful people.</p>
<h2>Be honest on what you're passionate about</h2>
<p>If you love what you do and are fortunate enough to get to do that regularly, especially as a full time career then you've hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>However, I see a lot of people stuck in places and in roles that they just don't have the passion or drive for. I'm well aware that not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to pick and choose, but as developers we have long held a valuable position in the job market where there are more jobs than there are developers.</p>
<p>But this is really about having a truthful discussion with your inner dev and being both honest about what you <em>really</em> enjoy doing/not doing, and realistic about how to start a role doing this.</p>
<p>For example, if you really really really don't like PHP, then take care when interviewing or seeking out roles in development agencies where WordPress is heavily featured.</p>
<p>This advice is especially true for those seeking, perhaps, their first development roles. Be honest and candid about what's right for you and (if you're able to), don't just jump at the first opportunity that comes your way.</p>
<p>The more you can discover what direction you want to travel, the better aligned you'll be down the line in your career.</p>
<p>With all of the above said, please don't put pressure on yourself to decide too early. Sometimes you have to experience what you <em>don't</em> want to know what <em>is</em> right for you.</p>
<h2>Get a coding mentor</h2>
<p>I was supremely fortunate to have worked with some amazing developers back when I started. They were experienced, knowledgable, helpful and humble and really took me under their wing. I'll never be able to thank them enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, I'd highly recommend getting yourself a mentor to help with your development journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f095de9a3d4e32487247b46342959b1cc2f8e9d1/3c273/img/people-2569234_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is different from a teacher or tutor (although there is overlap at the edges of the roles): a mentor is a guiding light to help give you focus and direction, to answer questions and point you along the right path for your particular journey.</p>
<p>I'd recommend taking a look at <a href="https://codingcoach.io/" title="Coding Coach website">Coding Coach</a> or my very own <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/mentorship" title="Rob Kendal coding mentorship programmes">mentorship programmes</a> to find a mentor that's right for you.</p>
<h2>Mentor others</h2>
<p>Following on from the last point, you too can be a mentor and again, you don't have to have coded for decades or be an absolute expert.</p>
<p>Think about where you are on your journey and how far you've come. Even if you're 6-8 months into learning to code, there are people only 1-2 <em>weeks</em> into theirs; these are the people you can definitely help out.</p>
<p>That said, if you <em>are</em> quite experienced, then all the more reason to help someone else who's just starting out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Become the guide you wish you'd had when you started</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's rewarding beyond measure, and a win win situation: someone getting started is helped and guided, and you learn so much in the process, believe me.</p>
<h2>You don't get what you don't ask for</h2>
<p>I'm from Yorkshire in the UK and there's a saying in this North East part of the world: Shy bairns get nowt.</p>
<p>In essence we're really saying that 'you get nothing by keeping quiet'.</p>
<p>It's easy to look at seemingly successful developers and popular Twitter personas and assume that everyone has lucky breaks and opportunity just falls from the sky.</p>
<p>To be honest, this does happen to a small number of people, but most of the successful people you'll know are a combination of trying (a lot), keeping their eyes open for opportunities and only a little sprinkle of luck.</p>
<p>Most of the time it's about asking for what you want. Now I'm not suggesting you just go kicking your boss' door in a demanding a raise, but in all seriousness, if you think you deserve a pay rise, prove it and then <em>ask for it</em>!</p>
<p>Want to switch up your career? Ask about training programs at your current workplace. Want to talk to someone on LinkedIn about their career? Ask them.</p>
<p>The worst that will happen is you get a 'no'. In which case, time to move on and try something else.</p>
<h2>Keep track of all your wins</h2>
<p>This is a big one for me. It's very easy as a human to skew towards the negative. Even if you've just launched five features on a product used by millions, I would bet that it's that single tiny error that happened that you'll be thinking about, right?!</p>
<p>I keep a notebook of little victories and compliments I've received and look through them from time to time, especially when the <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/2019-05-10-fighting-imposter-syndrome-as-a-developer" title="Fighting imposter syndrome as a developer">imposter syndrome</a> kicks in from time to time.</p>
<p>It's not about ego or vanity, but it's about celebrating your victories and remembering how far you've come.</p>
<h2>You don't have to know everything</h2>
<p>The world of deveopment is HUGE. I mean seriously almost infinite. Between languages, frameworks, patterns, platforms, frontend, backend, the list goes on.</p>
<p>When you're starting out there can be an overwhelming urge to have to know everything all at once. But I'm here to tell you that you don't need to know everything and, in reality, you can't or won't ever know it all q-- the landscape is just too vast.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3f6e59a451413441a9a9f410a3dd2bf527cf301f/b6003/img/magic-cube-1976725_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Of course, as a frontend developer starting out, I'd recommend focussing on the three core pillars of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but once you're getting into the swing of things, start to add bits and pieces to your knowledge depending on what takes your fancy.</p>
<h2>Senior doesn't mean encylopedia</h2>
<p>Just because someone is a senior developer or an architect or principle, or has been programming for 100's of years, does not automatically make them the all knowing beasts you think they may be.</p>
<p>I'll let you into a secret: I've been developing in a fullstack fashion for over fifteen years and I still have to look up some of the most trivial snippets of code; I still miss semicolons out of things and I still make mistakes.</p>
<p>Sure, I know a lot about a lot, but there's oceans of knowledge I haven't even sailed upon. Just because people have been around the block doesn't directly equate to an infallible, all-knowing knowledge. Neither does it mean they're always automatically right or know better.</p>
<p>The point I'm driving at here is that just because you're less experienced or starting out doesn't mean your ideas are less valuable or that you have less to contribute.</p>
<p>It's also why adopting a life long approach to learning is so important as a developer.</p>
<h2>Titles don't really mean much in the long run</h2>
<p>Another thing to bear in mind is that some people get caught up in a title race and it's easy to think that becoming a 'principle developer' or 'lead architect' is the end goal. Yes, titles and recognition are nice and there's money and rewards that come with more senior titles, but they don't always reflect the abilities of the holder nor</p>
<p>I'm not saying that it's not OK to have 'become a lead developer' as a goal, but don't set your standards by the titles that you, or others, hold. It's your attitude, actions, and what you contribute to the development community that will ultimately shape your legacy.</p>
<h2>Networking is essential!!</h2>
<p>It really is <em>who you know</em> not always <em>what you know</em>.</p>
<p>I wish I'd spent more time making connections with other developers, recruiters, leaders, and makers …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>As Bitcoin approaches a new price record after 3 years delay a new wave of its popularity and advertisement is expected. In such waves all the risks, downsides, pitfalls are usually hidden and the bright future is pleasantly described. I want to highlight all those dark corners and also to give my view of this field.</p>

<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>As the first decentralized digital currency Bitcoin’s main purpose was to serve as a digital money service that requires no trust in a central authority, and that will be free from control. But with an extreme raise of its value it gained another purpose — as an investment asset. Current data suggests that the second purpose greatly supersedes the original one.</p>

<p>In accordance with those two purposes, we’ll consider two types of downsides and risks — technical and economical.</p>

<h3 id="technical-downsides"><strong>Technical downsides</strong></h3>

<p>Two main technical downsides of Bitcoin are inefficiency and limited scalability.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">Bitcoin energy consumption index</a>, as of the time of writing, one single transaction consumes 700 kWh of energy, a huge waste. And this consumption will only increase with the growth of the network.</p>

<p>But increasing energy consumption isn’t the biggest problem since the growth of the total number of transactions is limited due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem">Bitcoin scalability problem</a>. It is estimated that the whole Bitcoin throughput can’t be more than 7 transactions per second on average. This is the dead-end for its original purpose.</p>

<p>While the absolute majority of other cryptocurrencies are useless imitators or straight-up scams, some of them indeed have slight improvements or useful extensions. It’s hard to create something perfect from the first shot, after all. Technology advancement is an evolutionary process.</p>

<p>I find this risk the most important — an emergence of a novel cryptocurrency that will contain a critical mass of improvements and extensions. Or, it could be just decent cryptocurrency, but backed by strong financial institutions (though it’s unlikely that some government will ever release a truly decentralized currency).</p>

<h3 id="economic-picture"><strong>Economic picture</strong></h3>

<p>Bitcoin proponents will argue that technical limitations are not an issue. They like to compare Bitcoin with gold, and gold isn’t transporting on the left and right. What they don’t say is that gold is a <em>natural</em> resource that has a lot of different uses in electronics, medicine, or even in food. Also, it’s naturally hard to obtain, it’s produced only in rare cosmic events, like supernova explosions or neutron stars collisions. And what is Bitcoin without its original purpose?</p>

<p>Well, it’s certainly a masterpiece, the first of a kind. But in this perspective it’s comparable with works of arts. They also have value, but no particular, instrumental purpose.</p>

<p>Thus, Bitcoin value will be pure speculation in the future with more advanced technologies. But in its current price there is also a huge amount of speculation. With no doubt the majority of people “invest” in Bitcoin just to raise a fortune, not to use it as payment. Though, I wouldn’t call it an investment. A typical investment is supposed to be spent on the production of new value. But no new value is produced when you buy Bitcoin. This is why it looks just like a financial pyramid — newcomers are the only reason for the price growth.</p>

<h3 id="a-huge-oxymoron"><strong>A huge oxymoron</strong></h3>

<p>Finally, I want to address the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<p>Despite imperfections, Bitcoin was built with great ideals in mind.
Decentralization and freedom are the values that humankind must pursue, I believe.</p>

<p>But the ecosystem that arose around Bitcoin is mostly ignorant of those ideals.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exchanges</em></strong></p>

<p>A huge part of the cryptocurrency world is the exchanges. 
But they are centralized! They are in control of your funds. You have to trust them. So there is no difference with an ordinary financial institution. Well, actually, there is. A cryptocurrency exchange found on the internet can be run by a high-school kid just for fun.</p>

<p>Exchanges possess a great value in cryptocurrencies and are responsible for a big part of all Bitcoin transactions. They are entities that have the power and resources to play with the market.</p>

<p>The problem of exchanges can’t be solved since truly decentralized exchanges are impossible or impractical.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mining pools</em></strong></p>

<p>A mining pool is a clever way to unite the computational resources needed for mining new blocks. But again, they are centralized and as a single miner you have to trust them. There are pools that require no trust in a coordinator, but they don’t propose additional incentives for a single miner.</p>

<p>A dozen mining pools generate around 75% of new Bitcoin blocks according to <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/pools">these stats</a>. Control them — and you can control the network. Note that big exchanges have their own mining pools. Yeah, decentralization…</p>

<p><strong><em>Mixers</em></strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin mixer is a way to hide a transaction sender and receiver. The story is the same as with exchanges and pools. They are centralized in nature and this can’t be solved.</p>

<p><strong><em>Stable cryptocurrencies</em></strong></p>

<p>This is the most ridiculous part and the best indicator of all of this farce. For me “stable cryptocurrency” is just an oxymoron. Operators of such mimic currencies are not only centralized and you have to trust them — they do not even comply with the laws of countries that print original currencies. They are worse than ordinary banks.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">coinmarketcap</a>, Tether, a USD mimic, is in the third place by a total market value and largely exceeds Bitcoin in transactions volume. A clusterfuck in the world of cryptocurrencies, in my opinion. Decentralization? What decentralization?</p>

<h3 id="the-future"><strong>The future</strong></h3>

<p>While I’m a big proponent of decentralization, I don’t believe in the longtime future of Bitcoin. The only reason for its future survival is the respect of its users. I have no idea what price it can achieve, but I’m 100% sure the price will have a speculative nature.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about corporate knowledge management systems recently.</p>



<p>If we think about a company as an organism, then a knowledge management system is essentially the (collective) brain that keeps that organism alive and running. A corporate knowledge management system should contain every single bit of codifiable information within the company resulting in a library of all projects, processes and procedures.</p>



<p>In an ideal state, it is the single source of truth that helps to inform every individual in the firm about what everyone else is up to. Information should be easy to add (input) as well as easy to search and find (output) resulting in quick knowledge transfer between different employees.</p>



<p>In reality, however, this hardly ever is the case. As anyone who has ever worked at a larger company can attest to, company knowledge bases always end up being a huge mess. </p>



<p>What starts with a neatly organized Confluence wiki, over time morphs into a multi-headed monster consisting of millions of notes and documents that live across Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Asana and half a dozen different wiki tools. Most docs will be outdated, some will contradict others and the one you are really looking for only shows up on page 14 of your search results.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/monster-4.png"></p><p>It seems like things usually start to fall apart once a company surpasses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar number</a> of 150 employees. This is probably when people start to realize that all the different documents of <em>explicit knowledge</em> they were amassing over the years have been held together with <em>implicit knowledge</em>. </p>



<p>It’s easy to find – and understand – the right documents when you know every other person in the company, but once you’re past that point, you need a system to organize all the data so that people can make sense of it.</p>



<p>The idea behind tools like Notion is to solve this problem by using just one tool for all your different knowledge documents. Instead of Google Docs AND Asana AND Trello AND Airtable, you just do everything in Notion. This reduces complexity because you don’t have to switch and search across different apps. At the same time, Notion forces you to think about a system that makes information easy to find with its folder-like structure and links between different databases.</p>



<p>I’ve never used Notion with more than half a dozen people myself, but from what I’ve heard from people at larger companies, Notion knowledge bases also don’t scale very well beyond a certain number of users. Once too many people start contributing to it, things become bloated and unnavigable.</p>



<p>A friend at Stripe recently suggested – half-jokingly – that we should hire a librarian to organize all our internal data and documentation. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea. Perhaps every company should hire a Chief Notion Officer once it hits 100 employees?!</p>



<p>An alternative approach to Notion is a knowledge management system that can live across different tools and without active manual curation because it’s based on really powerful search. The folder structure of your Google Drive, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> matter because looking up documents via search is faster and more convenient. Meta search tools like <a href="https://usefyi.com/">FYI</a> are supposed to offer the same but across different productivity tools.</p>



<p>But again I’m skeptical that this really works beyond a certain amount of users (and thus documents). I remember even Google’s internal search engine doing only a mediocre job of surfacing the most relevant documents (and even if it did you weren’t sure if there wasn’t a better or more up-to-date version of it).</p>



<p>I’m sure we’ll get there eventually, but until then we probably need a mix of automated search and manual human help – which is where Slack comes in. I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1097940802737704960">always thought</a> Slack plus Notion plus <a href="https://www.atspoke.com/">Spoke</a> would make a really powerful product (and I’m surprised Slack hasn’t made any major acquisitions in this space).</p>



<p>If you think about it, Slack is basically a search engine powered by humans: Most Slack messages are just questions. <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">It’s 911 for when everything else fails</a>. So if Slack had access to your entire knowledge base, it could answer at least the most commonly asked questions automatically. The rest would still get answered manually by the channel participants. Or your Chief Notion Officer.</p>

The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been theorized to provide protection against COVID-19. In a new study published in mBio, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology researchers provide further proof of this theory.</p><div id="text">
<p>Researches have shown, in new study <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/6/e02628-20">published in mBio</a>, that mumps IgG titers, or levels of IgG antibody, are inversely <strong>correlated</strong> with severity in recovered COVID-19 patients previously vaccinated with the MMR II vaccine produced by Merck. MMR II contains the <strong>Edmonston strain of measles</strong>, the Jeryl Lynn (B-level) strain of mumps, and the Wistar RA 27/3 strain of rubella.</p>
<p>"We found a statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titer levels and COVID-19 severity in people under age 42 <strong>who have had MMR II vaccinations</strong>," said lead study author Jeffrey E. Gold, president of World Organization, in Watkinsville, Georgia. "This adds to other associations demonstrating that <strong>the MMR vaccine may be protective against COVID-19</strong>. It also may explain why children have a much lower COVID-19 case rate than adults, as well as a much lower death rate. The majority of children get their first MMR vaccination around 12 to 15 months of age and a second one from 4 to 6 years of age."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found a statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titer levels and COVID-19 severity in people under age 42 who have had MMR II vaccinations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the new study, the researchers divided 80 subjects into 2 groups. The MMR II group consisted of 50 U.S. born subjects who would primarily <strong>have MMR antibodies from the MMR II vaccine</strong>. A comparison group of 30 subjects had no record of MMR II vaccinations, and would primarily have MMR antibodies from other sources, including prior measles, mumps, and/or rubella illnesses. The researchers found a significant inverse correlation (rs = -0.71, P &lt; 0.001) between mumps titers and COVID-19 severity within the MMR II group. There were no significant correlations between mumps titers and disease severity in the comparison group, between mumps titers and age in the MMR II group, or between severity and measles or rubella titers in either group.</p>
<p>Within the MMR II group, mumps titers of 134 to 300 AU/ml (n=8) were only found in those who were functionally immune or asymptomatic. All with mild COVID-19 symptoms had mumps titers below 134 AU/ml (n=17). All with moderate symptoms had mumps titers below 75 AU/ml (n=11). All who had been hospitalized and required oxygen had mumps titers below 32 AU/ml (n=5). Titers were measured by Quest Diagnostics using their standard diagnostic protocol.</p>
<p>"This is the <strong>first immunological study</strong> to evaluate the relationship between the MMR II vaccine and COVID-19. The statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titers and COVID-19 indicates that there is a relationship involved that warrants further investigation," said coauthor David J. Hurley, PhD, professor and molecular microbiologist at the University of Georgia. "The MMR II vaccine is considered a safe vaccine with very few side effects. If it has the ultimate benefit of preventing infection from COVID-19, preventing the spread of COVID-19, reducing the severity of it, or a combination of any or all of those, it is a very high reward low risk ratio intervention. Maximum seropositivity is achieved through two vaccinations at least 28 days apart. Based upon our study, it would be prudent to vaccinate those over 40 regardless of whether or not they already have high serum MMR titers."</p>

November 21, 2020 | https://kunalspathak.github.io/2020-11-21-About-doskeys/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kunalspathak.github.io/2020-11-21-About-doskeys/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Ever since I came to know about the <code>doskey</code> command in MS-DOS, I could barely stop myself using it. Not many Windows developers are familiar with this command, but this is a very powerful command to have in the arsenal of any Windows developer who frequently works on command line. If you type <code>doskey /?</code>, here is what you will see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
Edits command lines, recalls Windows commands, and creates macros.

DOSKEY [/REINSTALL] [/LISTSIZE=size] [/MACROS[:ALL | :exename]]
  [/HISTORY] [/INSERT | /OVERSTRIKE] [/EXENAME=exename] [/MACROFILE=filename]
  [macroname=[text]]
vvv 
  /REINSTALL          Installs a new copy of Doskey.
  /LISTSIZE=size      Sets size of command history buffer.
  /MACROS             Displays all Doskey macros.
  /MACROS:ALL         Displays all Doskey macros for all executables which have
                      Doskey macros.
  /MACROS:exename     Displays all Doskey macros for the given executable.
  /HISTORY            Displays all commands stored in memory.
  /INSERT             Specifies that new text you type is inserted in old text.
  /OVERSTRIKE         Specifies that new text overwrites old text.
  /EXENAME=exename    Specifies the executable.
  /MACROFILE=filename Specifies a file of macros to install.
  macroname           Specifies a name for a macro you create.
  text                Specifies commands you want to record.

UP and DOWN ARROWS recall commands; ESC clears command line; F7 displays
command history; ALT+F7 clears command history; F8 searches command
history; F9 selects a command by number; ALT+F10 clears macro definitions.

The following are some special codes in Doskey macro definitions:
$T     Command separator.  Allows multiple commands in a macro.
$1-$9  Batch parameters.  Equivalent to %1-%9 in batch programs.
$*     Symbol replaced by everything following macro name on command line.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I will not be explaining all the features of this command, but will elaborate on very important feature called <code>MACROS</code>. This command lets you create a shorthand alias for your command. Once you create an alias, you can trigger that command using the alias. The alias can also take the command line parameters that you would have otherwise passed to the original command.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Let’s say that you frequently execute command <code>findstr /sin &lt;search string&gt;</code> to search a string in a directory, you could set an alias for that command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey find=findstr /sin $*

C:\&gt;find abc

&lt;&lt;results of findstr&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, I have created an alias <code>find</code> and mapped it to the DOS command I want to execute i.e. <code>findstr /sin</code> in this case. The parameter <code>abc</code> to the alias is forwarded to the DOS command that is mapped to that alias.</p>

<p>However, I find <code>doskey</code> more useful in triggering various development commands too like build, run, copying files, opening debugger, etc. To give an example, the command to build dotnet’s <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/workflow/building/coreclr/README.md">coreclr</a> is <code>&lt;repo_root&gt;\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64</code>. I have mapped <code>bclr</code> alias to this command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\runtime&gt;doskey bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64&amp;popd

D:\some_dir&gt;bclr

&lt;&lt;triggers build for x64 checked&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now imagine you need to trigger the <code>bclr</code> command for other architectures and configurations. You could pass the arguments in the form of <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code> and so forth to the alias. For that, you need to configure alias to accept parameter.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>D:\some_dir&gt;doskey bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration $2 -arch $1&amp;popd

D:\some_dir&gt;bclr arm64 checked

&lt;&lt;trigger build for arm64 checked&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="my-favorite-aliases">My favorite aliases</h2>

<p>Here are some of my favorite aliases that I have configured and use frequently.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Below are some of the aliases I set for navigating between various directories while on DOS command line.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey ..=..\$*
C:\&gt;doskey ...=..\..\$*
C:\&gt;doskey mydir=cd /d C:\this\is\mydir

C:\deep\down\dir\structure&gt;..
C:\deep\down\dir&gt;
C:\deep\down\dir&gt;..anotherdir
C:\deep\down\anotherdir&gt;
C:\deep\down\anotherdir&gt;mydir
C:\this\is\mydir&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="development-commands">Development commands</h3>

<p>You can set alias to perform your development activities like building, opening your favorite IDE or debugger.</p>

<p>To open your project using appropriate version of Visual Studio:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey worksln="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" C:\git\work\somedir\work.sln
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To trigger build command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey buildall=pushd C:\git\work&amp;buildir\build.cmd x64 checked&amp;popd 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To configure windbg with favorite settings:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey dbg=C:\debuggers\windbg.exe -o -y C:\git\work\bin\symboldirPDB -srcpath C:\git\work $*
C:\&gt;dbg work.exe hello world
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To set the environment variables:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*

C:\&gt;jitasm HelloWorld
C:\&gt;set COMPl
COMPlus_JitDisasm=HelloWorld
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="getfindopen-aliases">Get/Find/Open aliases</h3>

<p>You can also configure some aliases that can help you manipulate the aliases that you have already set.</p>

<p>To list all the aliases set so far:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c:\&gt;doskey allkeys=doskey /macros

c:\&gt;allkeys
find=findstr /sin $*
buildall=pushd C:\git\work&amp;buildir\build.cmd x64 checked&amp;popd
bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64&amp;popd
..=..\$*
jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*
worksln="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" C:\git\work\somedir\work.sln
dbg=C:\debuggers\windbg.exe -o -y C:\git\work\bin\symboldirPDB -srcpath C:\git\work $*
...=..\..\$*
mydir=cd /d C:\this\is\mydir
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To search for an alias or command, you could set below alias inside a macro file (see below for macro file)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c:\&gt;doskey getkey=doskey /macros | findstr /i $*
c:\&gt;getkey asm
jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="macro-file">Macro file</h2>

<p>Instead of setting individual aliases using <code>doskey</code>, you could have all aliases in a text file and import it in at once using <code>/macrofile</code> switch.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt; more myaliases.txt
find=findstr /sin $*
bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64&amp;popd
worksln="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" C:\git\work\somedir\work.sln
buildall=pushd C:\git\work&amp;buildir\build.cmd x64 checked&amp;popd 
dbg=C:\debuggers\windbg.exe -o -y C:\git\work\bin\symboldirPDB -srcpath C:\git\work $*
jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*
..=..\$*
...=..\..\$*
mydir=cd /d C:\this\is\mydir

C:\&gt;doskey /macrofile=myaliases.txt

&lt;&lt; all aliases registered &gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to update the aliases and re-import it, you could do something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Open the macro file imported
c:\&gt;doskey okeys=notepad c:\myaliases.txt 

# Re-import macro file
c:\&gt;doskey updatekeys=doskey /macrofile=C:\myaliases.txt

# Now you could update and re-import the aliases

c:\&gt;okeys
&lt;&lt; update aliases.txt &gt;&gt;

c:\&gt;updatekeys
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>I usually have my aliases in a file <code>myaliases.txt</code>.  I wanted a way that every time I open my command prompt, all the aliases should be registered without me having to run the <code>doskey /macrofile</code> command manually. For that, I <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/run-command-prompt-commands-desktop-shortcut/">created a DOS command prompt shortcut</a>. Then, I opened the “Properties” of that shortcut and as shown below, in the “Target” section, execute the <code>doskey /macrofile</code> command.</p>

<p><img width="70%" height="70%" src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/doskey/command-shortcut.JPG"></p>

<p>Here is the complete command that I have in “Target” section:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k "set reporoot=c:\git\runtime&amp;&amp;set BuildArch=arm64&amp;&amp;set BuildType=Debug&amp;&amp; doskey /MACROFILE=C:\myaliases.txt"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see above, I also set some environment variables like <code>reporoot</code> and <code>BuildArch</code>. I use these environment variables inside <code>myaliases.txt</code> and so I make sure that they are set before I import the <code>myaliases.txt</code> file as a <code>doskey macro</code>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><code>doskey</code> proved to be a very productive command for me and I realized that there is no limit on how creative you could get with it. I hope you find some good use of this command to make your day-to-day DOS commands productive.</p>

<p>Namaste!</p>

<p>Other than that, I hope you like this sheet and it helps you, should you ever need to build a module by hand.
Why you would need to do that?
Because building modules from the command line is the best way to get to know them.
So if you're <a href="https://nipafx.dev/course-java-module-system/">learning what Java's module system has to offer</a>, I recommend putting your build tool aside for a day and go old-school.</p></article></section></main></div></div>]]>

the company believes that<strong> “privacy is a fundamental human right.”</strong></p><p>Horvath explains that Apple <span>delayed the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature</span> to give developers more time to prepare for the changes.</p><h2><strong>Facebook’s complaints about Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</strong></h2><p>Facebook has criticized the App Tracking Transparency feature and said it <span>could cause ad revenue to&nbsp;drop as much as 40%</span>.</p><p>Facebook has reportedly met with advertising partners to discuss the impact the change has on advertising when users have the ability to easily opt-out of cross-platform tracking.</p><p>The company also announced the following <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/preparing-our-partners-for-ios-14-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">in a press release</a> on Sept 10th.</p><blockquote><p>“We, along with the rest of the business community, continue to await final policy details from Apple.”</p><p>Given Apple’s delayed implementation of the user permission requirement, we will continue collecting IDFA on iOS 14 in an attempt to reduce unnecessary disruption to our customers’ businesses.”</p></blockquote><p>We checked in with FTC to see if they were looking into some of the claims made by FaceBook against Apple’s iOS 14.</p><figure id="attachment_1004628"

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a>, a constant-time compare function implementation in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is a great case to demonstrate the <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/language-design/#0008401">predictable performance of OCaml’s compiler</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of a constant-time compare function is to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>, which requires fully deterministic and predictable runtime performance.</li>
<li>Usually, cryptography functions are written in assembly to have total control of resulting binary and avoid unneeded optimization by the compiler.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a> showed us that you can write clean OCaml and get simple and predictable resulting assembly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This is the first issue of <a href="https://learnocamlthehardway.substack.com/welcome">Learn OCaml the Hard Way</a>. A publication about learning OCaml from the ground up.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Here’s the implementation of <code>eqaf</code>’s <code>equal</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span><span>[@</span>inline<span>]</span> get x i <span>=</span> String.unsafe_get x i <span>|&gt;</span> Char.code

  <span>let</span> bl <span>=</span> String.length b <span>in</span>
  <span>if</span> al <span>&lt;&gt;</span> bl
  <span>then</span> false
  <span>else</span> equal <span>~</span>ln<span>:</span>al a b
</code></pre></div><p>Besides basic OCaml syntaxes[1], interesting bits in the example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can force OCaml to always inline a function via adding an attribute <code>[@inline]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>

<p>Here’s the resulting assembly of the previous example, copied from the <code>eqaf</code> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml">source</a>. You can get the same output via <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><code>eqaf</code> allows us to have a basic understanding about OCaml’s assembly output without inferences of GC, boxed values, and advanced syntaxes such as pattern matching. We will explore more in the future issues.</p>

Similar to their syndicates, AngelList is powering a new generation of Venture Capital Funds known as Rolling Venture Capital Funds. This will be an interesting evolution in the venture investing landscape. With a ongoing funding model and a diverse set of LPs, can emerging GPs use this new model to bring new forms of Venture Investing to help better serve startups?</p><p>With a quarter-to-quarter funding model, these Rolling Funds will have cashflow similar to that of their startup compatriots. Recurring money in, recurring expenses out. A lot of the new GPs that are emerging to start these funds are former startup founders who have been part of a recurring revenue business. </p><p>Venture capital funds have traditionally operated in a singular investing model, equity. As startups begin to grow and require capital to help do so, VC funds step in and provide capital in return for equity in the business. Given the risk involved, VC typically need to maximize their equity positions so that they companies that emerge as winners can return enough capital to cover their losses. The issue is that the model in which these companies grow isn’t so stepwise, they don’t get huge chunks of revenue dumped on them like &nbsp;in a funding round, their growth is gradual, with deferred revenue meaning that their revenue and customer base can often outgrow their capabilities with the burn rate they set based on their funding round.</p><p>With a new rolling venture capital model could we find new ways to adapt this? With fresh capital available to rolling fund GPs each quarter, could we find ways to inject capital and liquidity into startups on a more rolling basis, just like the subscriptions in these new funds. With more consistent access to capital, could we help more portfolio companies become winners as they use this capital to help grow faster and gain traction? Can we take these new tools and help innovate access to capital for startups the same way founders and entrepreneurs innovate products and service?</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>The Postgres.ai team is proud to announce version 2.0 of Database Lab Engine (DLE) for PostgreSQL, a modern database tool for building powerful development and testing environments based on <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/questions-and-answers#what-is-thin-cloning-thin-vs-thick-clones">thin cloning</a>. Using Database Lab API or CLI (and if you are using Database Lab SaaS, GUI), on a single machine with, say, a 1 TiB disk, you can easily create and destroy dozens of database copies of size 1 TiB each. All these copies are independently modifiable and created/destroyed in just a few seconds. This can become a game-changer in your development and testing workflow, improving time-to-market, and reducing costs of your non-production infrastructure.</p>
<p>This release continues our strategy to automate all routine tasks such as initialization of the PostgreSQL data directory, data transformation, and snapshot management. In DLE 2.0, all these tasks can be flexibly configured in a single configuration file. As a result, building dev&amp;test environments for projects with many databases (such as those that adopted microservice architecture) becomes much easier.</p>
<p>The previous versions of the Database Lab introduced the core technology: thin clone provisioning, based on either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> (default) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)">LVM</a>. It was already possible to provision full-sized multi-terabyte database clones in just a few seconds and use them for a broad spectrum of tasks such as database schema changes verification, SQL query analysis, or general application testing.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 speeds up and empowers the initialization of DLE itself. Instead of using custom scripts for initial and continuous data retrieval, it is now possible to configure everything in a declarative manner to get the data and be up and running.</p>
<h2 id="updates-in-dle-2-0">Updates in DLE 2.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automated data retrieval: specify the source and the method of initializing the data directory and how it is to be updated</li>
<li>Both physical (pg_basebackup, WAL-G, more) and logical methods (dump/restore, Amazon RDS, Heroku Postgres, more) are supported (see the guide <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/guides/data">Database Lab Engine data sources</a>)</li>
<li>Any managed cloud PostgreSQL offering is now supported, with additional features for Amazon RDS (see <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/tutorials/database-lab-tutorial-amazon-rds">DLE tutorial for Amazon RDS</a> and the guide <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/guides/data/rds">Data source: AWS RDS</a>)</li>
<li>For continuously updated physically initialized data directory (which effectively makes your DLE a specialized replica), snapshot management is fully automated: snapshots are created and destroyed based on the schedule defined in the configuration file (see the reference <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/database-lab/config-reference#job-physicalsnapshot">Job physicalSnapshot</a>)</li>
<li>Basic data transformation and masking supported: specify any custom script that will be applied each time a new snapshot is prepared (option <code>preprocessingScript</code> in both <code>logicalSnapshot</code> and <code>physicalSnapshot</code> jobs, see the <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/database-lab/config-reference">Configuration reference</a>)</li>
<li>License changed to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">AGPLv3</a></li>
<li>The documentation is significantly extended: 3 tutorials, 26 user guides, 6 references, and counting: <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs">http://postgres.ai/docs</a></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
      

      <p>
        WireGuard has gained traction over the past few years due, in part, to its high performance. We wondered how fast it really is, and realized that since we're already tracking VPN performance metrics for our <a href="https://vpnintel.com/unit-prices">VPN unit price index</a>, we could use the same data to answer the question, <strong>"how much faster is WireGuard than OpenVPN?"</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We focused on Windscribe, Mullvad, and NordVPN, three providers that support both WireGuard and OpenVPN, and built a <a href="https://vpnintel.com/wireguard-vs-openvpn">dashboard</a> to visualize their comparative download speeds. We've embedded the charts for the week ending November 20, 2020 below along with some commentary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that all data on this page represent speedtests between U.S.-based speedtest servers and VPNs. Our methodology section below has more on this.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <h2>Windscribe</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the week ending November 20, 2020, Windscribe's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>134 Mbps</span> and its average download speed over WireGuard was <span>363 Mbps</span>. This means that by simply toggling the WireGuard option, Windscribe users can get a free 2.7x speed boost!
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day Windscribe averages are 340 Mbps for WireGuard and 144 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Windscribe's Wireguard speeds are almost always in the 300-400 Mbps ranges. Dig deeper into performance and pricing info on our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/windscribe-wireguard">Windscribe WireGuard</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/windscribe">Windscribe OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Mullvad</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mullvad was one of WireGuard's earliest commercial supporters. For the week ending November 20, 2020, Mullvad's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>258 Mbps</span> and its average download speed over WireGuard was <span>672 Mbps</span> – a free 2.6x performance boost for Mullvad's WireGuard users!
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day Mullvad averages are 676 Mbps for WireGuard and 274 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Mullvad's WireGuard speeds consistently land in the 600-700 Mbps range. Take a closer look at the pricing and performance data on our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/mullvad">Mullvad WireGuard</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/mullvad-openvpn">Mullvad OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>NordVPN</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        NordVPN launched support for WireGuard via its NordLynx product in Spring 2020. For the week ending November 20, 2020, Mullvad's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>395 Mbps</span>. If the only number you remember from this page is NordVPN's average WireGuard download speed, you'll have the idea: a ridiculously fast <span>777 Mbps</span>, a 1.9x boost over its OpenVPN service.
      </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day NordVPN averages are 780 Mbps for WireGuard and 417 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        You can see that NordVPN actually exceeds gigabit speeds on occasion. Its WireGuard speeds have a bit more variance than the other providers, but is uniformly well above 500 Mbps. For a deeper dive into NordLynx pricing and performance, check out our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/nordvpn-wireguard">NordVPN WireGuard/NordLynx</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/nordvpn">NordVPN OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        For the week ending November 20, 2020, our global average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>251 Mbps</span> and <span>583 Mbps</span> over WireGuard – WireGuard outperformed OpenVPN by an incredible 230%!
      </p>
      <p>
        All the more incredible is that customers of these services get this speed boost for free simply by selecting the WireGuard option.
      </p>
      <p>
        NordVPN's 1.9x ratio is a little lower than the other providers', but it still has a massive raw speed advantage. If NordVPN can get its WireGuard speeds up to the 2.5x+ ratios held by Windscribe and Mullvad, then it will be consistently serving gigabit speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's it for now! We think this stuff is interesting, so we'll probably make this a monthly or quarterly report. If you'd like to know when we launch new tools and publish reports like this, please join our newsletter:

       As of November 24, 2020, WireGuard clocks in at 598 Mbps to OpenVPN's 288 Mbps, a 2.1x speed boost.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Our system is fully automated which lets us take thousands of readings a day. The data on this page represents speedtests conducted between servers based in the U.S. and VPN servers also based in the U.S. – the speeds shown here are likely to be faster than what you would experience at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        All speedtests are done over UDP with the native OpenVPN and WireGuard Linux clients except for NordVPN's NordLynx/WireGuard service which uses the NordVPN Linux client since NordVPN does not provide WireGuard configuration files.
      </p>

      <p>
        At least as of November 20, 2020, you'll see some lumps shared across the three charts which may reflect resource usage patterns for our own hosting provider. We will report back on this.

          <a name="topofpage"></a>
          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve developed some <em>opinions</em>. Some have worn particularly deep ruts,
reinforced by years of experience. I tried to figure out what these
had in common, and it’s
the idea that <strong>code in production is the only code that matters</strong>. Staging doesn’t
matter, code on your laptop doesn’t matter, QA doesn’t matter,
only production matters. Everything else is debt.</p>

<p>This perspective probably comes from years sitting in between
operations and product development. I strongly
believe that teams should optimize for getting code to production as quickly as
possible as well as responding to incidents in production.</p>

<p>This idea, and a lot of the practices it implies, can be
counter-intuitive or controversial, so I want to dive into them a little
further. What follows is a set of practices and principles I believe are true,
considering my underlying belief that code working in production is the only
code that matters.</p>

<h2 id="engineers-should-operate-their-code">1. Engineers should operate their code.</h2>

<p><strong>Engineers are the subject matter experts for the code they write and should be
responsible for operating it in production</strong>. In this context, “operating” means
deploying, instrumenting, and monitoring code as well as helping to resolve
incidents related to or impacting that code. The responsibility of operating
code aligns incentives - it encourages engineers to write code that is
observable and easy to debug, and connects them to what customers really care
about. It encourages them to be curious about how their code is performing in
production. Importantly, engineers should be on-call for their code - being
on-call creates a positive feedback loop and makes it easier to know if their
efforts in writing production-ready code are paying off. I’ve heard people
complain about the prospect of being on-call, so I’ll just ask this: if you’re
not on-call for your code, who is?</p>

<p>If you’re not currently on-call for your code but want to be, and can help
influence this decision, there are some things you can do. Set up PagerDuty (or
similar) schedules for each group of engineers responsible for specific
services or parts of your code. A good schedule has 6–8 engineers. There are
plenty of variations, but a typical template is to have one-week rotations,
where you’ll be on-call for secondary for a week and then primary for a week.
Configuring alerts is a separate topic, which probably deserves it’s own blog
post entirely, but focus on things that impact your customers (see:
Symptom-based alerting) and remember that you’re ultimately responsible for how
you respond to alerts, which means you can change them.</p>

<p>There are two talks I’d recommend watching that touch on the topic of
configuring alerts: Liz Fong-Jones talks about SLOs in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4jbUzEVL0">Cultivating Production Excellence</a> and Aditya Mukerjee does a great job talking about techniques for
managing alerts in <a href="https://vimeo.com/274820572">Warning: This Talk Contains Content Known to the State of California to Reduce Alert Fatigue</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buy-almost-always-beatsbuild">2. Buy Almost Always Beats&nbsp;Build</h2>

<p><strong>If you can avoid building something, you should.</strong> Code is the most expensive
way to solve a problem that isn’t addressing a core area of your business. For
most small to mid-sized companies, there are open source or better yet, hosted
solutions that solve a wide range of common problems. I mean things like git
repository hosting (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc), observability tooling
(Honeycomb, Lightstep, etc), managed databases (Amazon RDS, Confluent Kafka,
etc), alerting (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc) and a whole host of other commodity
technologies. This even applies to your infrastructure - if you can help
it, don’t roll your own Kubernetes clusters (side note: do you even need to use
Kubernetes?), don’t roll your own load balancers if you can use Amazon ELB or
ALBs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> syndrome is very real and some companies get burned badly by
this. I’ve seen teams light time and money on fire reinventing components when
better, more battle-tested alternatives exist in the market. Those same teams
almost always end up spending years contending with the resulting technical
debt. If you’re on such a team and have the will and ability to impact change,
start rolling back these decisions one by one. Migrate your databases to a
managed provider, migrate your feature flagging system to a SaaS tool (i.e.
LaunchDarkly). Keep going until the only software you maintain yourselves is
the software that delivers value to your customers. You’ll be much, much better
off for it.</p>

<h2 id="make-deployseasy">3. Make Deploys&nbsp;Easy</h2>

<p>Deploying should be a frequent and unexciting activity. <strong>Engineers should be
able to deploy with minimal manual steps and it should be easy to see if the
deploy is successful</strong> (this requires instrumenting your code for observability,
which - tada - is covered above), and it should be easy to roll back a deploy
if something doesn’t go well. Deploying frequently implies that
deploys are smaller, and smaller deploys are generally easier, faster and
safer.</p>

<p>Many teams implement periods where deploys are forbidden - these can be
referred to as code freezes, or deploy policies like “Don’t deploy on Fridays”.
Having such blackout periods can lead to a pile-up of changes, which increases
the overall risk of something going very wrong.</p>

<p>If you’re on a team that fears deploys, dedicate a percentage of your
engineering time to improvements in your deployment pipeline until the fear is
gone. On a recent team I worked with, we were able to improve deploy times from
3 hours to 30 minutes, which drastically improved the teams’ confidence in the
deploy process. A natural side effect of this was that engineers started
deploying much more frequently instead of waiting for changes to pile up enough
to warrant a “release” (which was synonymous with a deploy).</p>

<p>The book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a>
has been getting a lot of attention. If you haven’t read it, I’d recommend it.
The team behind it also publishes the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/">State of DevOps</a>
reports, which are full of well-researched information about what various
companies in the industry are doing. It’s not a coincidence that two of the
four key metrics that the book focuses on are directly related to this (Deploy
Frequency, Change Lead Time). Shipping is <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-12-speed-of-deployment-with-rich-archbold-of-intercom/">your company’s heartbeat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trust-the-people-closest-to-theknives">4. Trust the People Closest to the&nbsp;Knives</h2>

<p><strong>The people who work with a system are the ones who understand it best.</strong> This
applies to any part of the socio-technical systems within which we all work. In
the case of software systems, the engineers who deploy every day and are
on-call for critical services understand the level of risk they operate in. A
sad trend is that managers tend to overestimate their teams’ progress on
certain transitions - i.e. cloud-native, DevOps, etc. The higher up the
management chain, the larger this overestimation tends to be. Engineers who
deploy and get paged when things break know where the bodies are buried and
they know what needs the most work. They should, therefore, be the primary
stakeholders responsible for prioritizing technical work.</p>

<p>Another manifestation of this principle applies to platform or services teams.
If you’re responsible for building some shared component that’s used within
your organization (i.e. a messaging system, ci/cd infrastructure, shared
libraries or services) there’s an uncomfortable truth lurking for you: the
people who use your work know more about it than you do in many cases. They
understand implicitly how it serves customers and they know what contortions or
hoops they have to jump through to get it to work. Listen to them for
clues on how to improve the UX of your services and tools.</p>

<h2 id="qa-gates-make-qualityworse">5. QA Gates Make Quality&nbsp;Worse</h2>

<p>Many teams have a manual QA step that gets performed before deploys. The idea,
I guess, is to have someone run automated or manual tests to verify that a set
of changes are ready to be released. This sounds like a comforting
idea - having a human being (or team of human beings) “verify” a release before
it goes out - <strong>but it falls victim to several false assumptions and creates
some misalignments that do more harm than good.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if there’s manual work that needs to be done before a deploy can
go out, that creates a bottleneck - if you’re making deploys easy, and
deploying small changes frequently, no QA team is going to be able to keep up
testing every deploy, and will inevitably block teams from deploying. That’s no
good. If you have manual tests, automate them and build them into your CI
pipeline (if they do deliver value).</p>

<p>Secondly, the teams doing QA often lack context and are under time pressure.
They may end up testing “effects” instead of “intents”. For example, I’ve seen
QA teams burn time testing that when something happens in a UI, something
related happens in a database. What happens when an engineer refactors that UI
component and changes the underlying data model? The functionality works, but
the test breaks. Because two teams are involved, this takes coordination and
time to fix. Similarly, I’ve seen QA teams block deploys because of failing
tests when caching was introduced at the CDN layer - a TTL of 5 seconds on an
activity feed may not ever be noticed by a user but it might break QA tests
causing unnecessary conflicts between product and QA engineers.</p>

<p>Luckily, solving this one is easy. Instead of having a dedicated QA team work
on creating manual and automated test cases that run in a fictitious QA
environment, reassign that team to work on continuous testing in production.
Instead of being a gate for deploys, a QA team could continuously verify that
production is working as expected. QA teams are also well situated to lead
Chaos Engineering initiatives, where faults are intentionally injected in
production. QA engineers could also work on making the CI/CD pipeline more
reliable, so that deploys are no longer a nightmare.</p>

<p>I was reading another engineer’s story this week about <a href="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/data-point-for-job-seeking-devs">his 65-day job hunt</a>. I’ve avoided traditional job applications and interviews since I graduated from college, but a few things struck me from this post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of targeting <em>every</em> job, Matt Dupree selectively applied at <strong>only 16 companies</strong> and withdrew applications when he thought the company was a bad fit. I love this advice.</li>
<li>Matt has built side projects, spoken at conferences, and blogged consistently for years. <strong>He walked into interviews with a trust level much higher than random applicants.</strong> I have said this before: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/code-notenough-karl-l-hughes/">coding skills are not enough to build a resilient career</a>.</li>
<li>Technical interviews still tell employers very little about an engineer’s ability (that’s a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">whole other blog post</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Not everyone has the luxury of choice when it comes to choosing their next job, but if you’re a software engineer, you should be able to get there. There’s more demand for our skillset than there is supply, but you have to be intentional if you want to build a resilient career.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-resilient-career">What is a “resilient career”?</h2>
<p>People with resilient careers don’t fear an economic downturn because they have been able to put a little money aside. They don’t fear losing their job because they probably have half a dozen offers they’ve declined in the past year. They don’t stress about financial concerns because they likely have one or two side hustles bringing in a little extra cash flow.</p>
<p>I mentioned at the top that I’ve haven’t applied for a job since college. Skipping this step in the job search has been possible because I’ve approached my career very differently from most software engineers. Here are my rules for creating a resilient career:</p>
<h3 id="1-only-work-for-companies-that-need-and-trust-you">1. Only work for companies that need and trust you</h3>
<p>I skipped the job application process with all three of my jobs since college by doing the work that companies wanted before I officially started working for them.</p>
<p>No, I don’t mean you should work for free. Here’s how it played out for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uloop hired me to start their blog because I spent my free time in college building a blog, recruiting writers, and learning to code. I worked as a contractor for Uloop while I finished college, and when I graduated, bringing me on full-time just meant signing a W2.</li>
<li>Packback hired me because I stayed in touch with the founder for about nine months before they had any funding. When they were looking to hire a full-time engineer, they gave me a project from their roadmap. I did it as a freelancer, then joined full-time after I turned it in.</li>
<li>The Graide Network brought me on months after I started building a relationship with their founder. Instead of interviewing, I began as a consultant a couple of nights per week before they had the funding to bring me on.</li>
</ul>
<p>During each of these test periods, I got to see how much the company needed someone with my skill set, build trust with them, and get a trial run of the day-to-day. If I ever look for a job again, I’ll keep using the same approach because it works well.</p>
<h3 id="2-your-network-is-your-biggest-asset">2. Your network is your biggest asset</h3>
<p>You might also notice that two of my three of these career moves involved knowing my boss for months before joining. Notice that I didn’t run into them at a Meetup one night and get hired the next day.</p>
<p>For some reason, Engineers hear “you should network more,” and think that means they should go out and meet new people. That’s not how it works. Relationships take months or years to cultivate. You <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">have to stay in touch</a> if you ever want them to pay off.</p>
<p>Spend maybe 25% of your time meeting new people and 75% of your time staying in touch with people who you genuinely like. Personal relationships are founded on common interests, goals, or experiences, so find a mix of people who are both ahead of and behind you in your journey.</p>
<h3 id="3-cultivate-a-variety-of-interests-and-potential-revenue-generators">3. Cultivate a variety of interests and potential revenue generators</h3>
<p>I have always had a side project or two - mostly learning opportunities - but in the past three years, I’ve realized that you can generate revenue and build a network from them. Over the years, my side projects have led to consulting gigs, job offers, freelance opportunities, and a lot of high-quality connections around the world.</p>
<p>For example, CFP Land makes <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/cfp-land">a couple hundred dollars per month in profit</a>, which is fine, but the connections I’ve made from running it are worth orders of magnitude more. My previous side project, <a href="https://github.com/jobapis">Job APIs</a>, brings me multiple consulting offers per month (99% of them aren’t worth doing, but still, it’s nice to know they’re there).</p>
<p>My point is, anything I do in my free time is an investment in making my career more resilient.</p>
<h3 id="4-learn-on-your-employers-dime">4. Learn on your employer’s dime</h3>
<p>I was talking to a friend recently about his job search. He was lamenting that after five years of working hard for his employer and being let go, he was struggling to find another company that used the same tech stack.</p>
<p>“How much time did you spend learning new tools, libraries, or frameworks each week while you were at your prior job?” I asked.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t time for that,” he lamented, “We were always pushing to the max to get stuff done on time.”</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that my friend’s employer let him go. He wasn’t growing and when the company needed fewer resources in his engineering realm, he was too specialized to move into another area. He was seen as a resource that had to be let go. I used to think you could <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/be-indispensable">be indispensible</a> by being the best at one thing, but I’m starting to move away from that belief.</p>
<p>Any employer I work for gets me working ~35 hours per week on the projects we plan and ~5 hours per week learning new things. My value to my employer only increases as I become a more well-rounded engineer, so learning is non-negotiable. Now I bake this into my team’s weekly retrospectives - we share what we’re learning with each other - so we can hold each other accountable for learning new things.</p>
<h2 id="make-the-journey-your-own">Make the journey your own</h2>
<p>Finally, what works for me won’t necessarily work for you. My journey has involved working for early-stage startups - which you might hate - and being a software development generalist. Still, I think the fundamental goal should be the same: to build a resilient career.</p>

<p>This post is hard to write, both in the emotional sense but also in the “I would
have written a shorter letter, but I didn’t have the time” sense. Hence, please
assume the best of intentions when reading it—it is not my intention to make
anyone feel bad about their contributions, but rather to provide some insight
into why my frustration level ultimately exceeded the threshold.</p>

<p>Debian has been in my life for well over 10 years at this point.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I have visited some old friends at the Zürich Debian meetup
after a multi-year period of absence. On my bike ride home, it occurred to me
that the topics of our discussions had remarkable overlap with my last visit. We
had a discussion about the merits of systemd, which took a detour to respect in
open source communities, returned to processes in Debian and eventually
culminated in democracies and their theoretical/practical failings. Admittedly,
that last one might be a Swiss thing.</p>

<p>I say this not to knock on the Debian meetup, but because it prompted me to
reflect on what feelings Debian is invoking lately and whether it’s still a good
fit for me.</p>

<p>So I’m finally making a decision that I should have made a long time ago: I am
winding down my involvement in Debian to a minimum.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h2>

<p>Over the coming weeks, I will:</p>

<ul>
<li>transition packages to be team-maintained where it makes sense</li>
<li>remove myself from the <code>Uploaders</code> field on packages with other maintainers</li>
<li>orphan packages where I am the sole maintainer</li>
</ul>

<p>I will try to keep up best-effort maintenance of the
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/">manpages.debian.org</a> service and the
<a href="https://codesearch.debian.net/">codesearch.debian.net</a> service, but any help
would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, please treat me as permanently on vacation. I will
try to be around for administrative issues (e.g. permission transfers) and
questions addressed directly to me, permitted they are easy enough to answer.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>When I joined Debian, I was still studying, i.e. I had luxurious amounts of
spare time. Now, over 5 years of full time work later, my day job taught me a
lot, both about what works in large software engineering projects and how I
personally like my computer systems. I am very conscious of how I spend the
little spare time that I have these days.</p>

<p>The following sections each deal with what I consider a major pain point, in no
particular order. Some of them influence each other—for example, if changes
worked better, we could have a chance at transitioning packages to be more
easily machine readable.</p>

<h3 id="change-process-in-debian">Change process in Debian</h3>

<p>The last few years, my current team at work conducted various smaller and larger
refactorings across the entire code base (touching thousands of projects), so we
have learnt a lot of valuable lessons about how to effectively do these
changes. It irks me that Debian works almost the opposite way in every regard. I
appreciate that every organization is different, but I think a lot of my points
do actually apply to Debian.</p>

<p>In Debian, packages are nudged in the right direction by a document called the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/">Debian Policy</a>, or its programmatic
embodiment, lintian.</p>

<p>While it is great to have a lint tool (for quick, local/offline feedback), it is
even better to not require a lint tool at all. The team conducting the change
(e.g. the C++ team introduces a new hardening flag for all packages) should be
able to do their work transparent to me.</p>

<p>Instead, currently, all packages become lint-unclean, all maintainers need to
read up on what the new thing is, how it might break, whether/how it affects
them, manually run some tests, and finally decide to opt in. This causes a lot
of overhead and manually executed mechanical changes across packages.</p>

<p>Notably, the <strong>cost of each change</strong> is distributed onto the package maintainers in
the Debian model. At work, we have found that the opposite works better: if the
team behind the change is put in power to do the change for as many users as
possible, they can be significantly more efficient at it, which reduces the
total cost and time a lot. Of course, exceptions (e.g. a large project abusing a
language feature) should still be taken care of by the respective owners, but
the important bit is that the default should be the other way around.</p>

<p>Debian is <strong>lacking tooling for large changes</strong>: it is hard to programmatically
deal with packages and repositories (see the section below). The closest to
“sending out a change for review” is to open a bug report with an attached
patch. I thought the workflow for accepting a change from a bug report was too
complicated and started <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2016-07-17-mergebot/">mergebot</a>, but only Guido
ever signaled interest in the project.</p>

<p>Culturally, reviews and reactions are slow. There are no deadlines. I literally
sometimes get emails notifying me that a patch I sent out a few years ago (!!)
is now merged. This turns projects from a small number of weeks into many years,
which is a huge demotivator for me.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, you can see artifacts of the slow online activity manifest
itself in the offline culture as well: I don’t want to be discussing systemd’s
merits 10 years after I first heard about it.</p>

<p>Lastly, changes can easily be slowed down significantly by holdouts who refuse
to collaborate. My canonical example for this is rsync, whose maintainer refused
my patches to make the package use debhelper purely out of personal preference.</p>

<p>Granting so much personal freedom to individual maintainers prevents us as a
project from raising the abstraction level for building Debian packages, which
in turn makes tooling harder.</p>

<p>How would things look like in a better world?</p>

<ol>
<li>As a project, we should strive towards more unification. Uniformity still
does not rule out experimentation, it just changes the trade-off from easier
experimentation and harder automation to harder experimentation and easier
automation.</li>
<li>Our culture needs to shift from “this package is my domain, how dare you
touch it” to a shared sense of ownership, where anyone in the project can
easily contribute (reviewed) changes without necessarily even involving
individual maintainers.</li>
</ol>

<p>To learn more about how successful large changes can look like, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrC6ROeV4GI">my
colleague Hyrum Wright’s talk “Large-Scale Changes at Google: Lessons Learned
From 5 Yrs of Mass Migrations”</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fragmented-workflow-and-infrastructure">Fragmented workflow and infrastructure</h3>

<p>Debian generally seems to prefer decentralized approaches over centralized
ones. For example, individual packages are maintained in separate repositories
(as opposed to in one repository), each repository can use any SCM (git and svn
are common ones) or no SCM at all, and each repository can be hosted on a
different site. Of course, what you do in such a repository also varies subtly
from team to team, and even within teams.</p>

<p>In practice, non-standard hosting options are used rarely enough to not justify
their cost, but frequently enough to be a huge pain when trying to automate
changes to packages. Instead of using GitLab’s API to create a merge request,
you have to design an entirely different, more complex system, which deals with
intermittently (or permanently!) unreachable repositories and abstracts away
differences in patch delivery (bug reports, merge requests, pull requests,
email, …).</p>

<p>Wildly diverging workflows is not just a temporary problem either. I
participated in long discussions about different git workflows during DebConf
13, and gather that there were similar discussions in the meantime.</p>

<p>Personally, I cannot keep enough details of the different workflows in my
head. Every time I touch a package that works differently than mine, it
frustrates me immensely to re-learn aspects of my day-to-day.</p>

<p>After noticing workflow fragmentation in the Go packaging team (which I
started), I tried fixing this with the <a href="https://go-team.pages.debian.net/workflow-changes.html">workflow changes
proposal</a>, but did not
succeed in implementing it. The lack of effective automation and slow pace of
changes in the surrounding tooling despite my willingness to contribute time and
energy killed any motivation I had.</p>

<h3 id="old-infrastructure-package-uploads">Old infrastructure: package uploads</h3>

<p>When you want to make a package available in Debian, you upload GPG-signed files
via anonymous FTP. There are several batch jobs (the queue daemon, <code>unchecked</code>,
<code>dinstall</code>, possibly others) which run on fixed schedules (e.g. <code>dinstall</code> runs
at 01:52 UTC, 07:52 UTC, 13:52 UTC and 19:52 UTC).</p>

<p>Depending on timing, I estimated that you might wait for over 7 hours (!!)
before your package is actually installable.</p>

<p>What’s worse for me is that feedback to your upload is asynchronous. I like to
do one thing, be done with it, move to the next thing. The current setup
requires a many-minute wait and costly task switch for no good technical
reason. You might think a few minutes aren’t a big deal, but when all the time I
can spend on Debian per day is measured in minutes, this makes a huge difference
in perceived productivity and fun.</p>

<p>The last communication I can find about speeding up this process is <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/12/msg00014.html">ganneff’s
post</a> from 2008.</p>

<p>How would things look like in a better world?</p>

<ol>
<li>Anonymous FTP would be replaced by a web service which ingests my package and
returns an authoritative accept or reject decision in its response.</li>
<li>For accepted packages, there would be a status page displaying the build
status and when the package will be available via the mirror network.</li>
<li>Packages should be available within a few minutes after the build completed.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="old-infrastructure-bug-tracker">Old infrastructure: bug tracker</h3>

<p>I dread interacting with the Debian bug
tracker. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbugs">debbugs</a> is a piece of software
(from 1994) which is only used by Debian and the GNU project these days.</p>

<p>Debbugs processes emails, which is to say it is asynchronous and cumbersome to
deal with. Despite running on the fastest machines we …</p></div></div>

November 21, 2020 | https://retrylife.ca/blog/2020/11/21/minecraft-irc | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://retrylife.ca/blog/2020/11/21/minecraft-irc">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <!-- Main content -->
                    <p>As I talked about in my post <a href="https://retrylife.ca/blog/2020/10/24/corepack-development">about Minecraft modpack development</a>, I got back in to playing Minecraft earlier this year. I primairly play on a server full of friends, where the server owner has <a href="https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap">dynmap</a> installed. Dynmap is a handy tool that provides a near-real-time overview of the minecraft world in the form of a webapp. I always keep Dynmap open on my laptop so I can chat with whoever is online, and see whats being worked on.</p>

<p>While dynmap has a built-in chat log, and the ability to send chats, the incoming chat messages do not persist, and the outgoing chat messages don’t always show your in-game username (but instead, your public IP address). Since I always have an IRC client open, I figured that making use of my IRC client to generate a persistent chat log in the background would be a good solution. Unfortunately, I could not find anyone who has ever built a <code>Minecraft &lt;-&gt; IRC</code> bridge. Thus my project, <a href="https://github.com/Ewpratten/chatster">chatster</a>, was born.</p>

<p>The most basic IRC server consists of a TCP socket, and only 7 message handlers:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Message Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>NICK</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user setting their nickname</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>USER</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user setting their identity / username</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>PASS</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user authenticating with the server</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>PING</code></td>
      <td>A simple ping-pong system</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>JOIN</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user joining a channel</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>QUIT</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user leaving a channel</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>PRIVMSG</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user sending a message</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>On the Minecraft side, the following subset of the <a href="https://wiki.vg/Protocol">in-game protocol</a> must be implemented (I just used the <a href="https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft"><code>pyCraft</code></a> library for this):</p>

<ul>
  <li>User authentication</li>
  <li>Receiving <a href="https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Chat_Message_.28clientbound.29"><code>clientbound.play.ChatMessage</code></a> packets</li>
  <li>Sending <a href="https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Chat_Message_.28serverbound.29"><code>serverbound.play.ChatMessage</code></a> packets</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole idea of chatster is that a user connects to the IRC server using their <a href="https://account.mojang.com/">Mojang account</a> email and password at their IRC nickname, and server password. The server temporarily stores these values in memory.</p>

<p>Connecting to a server is done via specific IRC channel names. If you wanted to connect to <code>mc.example.com</code> on port <code>12345</code>, you would issue the following IRC command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/JOIN #mc.example.com:12345
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Upon channel join, the server opens a socket to the specified Minecraft server, and relays chat messages (along with their sender) to both Minecraft and IRC. This means that ingame users show up in your IRC user list, and you can send commands and chats to the game.</p>

<p>The positive response to my post about <a href="https://blog.ceos.io/2020/11/14/why-i-teach-vim/">“Why I Teach vim”</a> has been extremely appreciated and the most common question I have received is “OK, but <em>how </em>do you teach vim? This is a much more difficult question to answer in a blog post as I have repeatedly found trying to explain teaching methods in writing is difficult. With that said, sometimes perfect is the enemy of good enough and let me see if I can take a shot at it. </p>



<p>I will even complicate things further and try to simultaneously teach teachers to teach vim as well as perhaps help a few programmers who want to take vim for a spin (maybe even who have been previously frustrated by it).</p>



<div><p>I must begin with a bit of <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/05/where-vim-came-from.html">historical context</a>. vi (the father of vim) was <a href="http://www.linfo.org/vi/history.html">invented</a> in 1976 by Bill Joy at the University of California, Berkeley. The potential user of vim needs to be aware that in 1976 many people used not monitors but printers to interact with a computer. As such, the most common way to edit text was with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_editor">line editor</a> which, as you might guess by the name, edited text one line at a time. vi was different than a line editor, vi was a visual editor and, ultimately, the name vi came from VIsual.</p><p>By 1976, people (really companies) were starting to be able to afford more <a href="https://www.tpub.com/incs/6.htm">CRT terminals</a>, think your parent’s (or grandparent’s) old style TVs. There were no mice, except in prototype computers at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox PARC</a>, and the programmer had only the keyboard to interact with their text editor. CRT terminals were a huge advantage for programmers used to line editors and literally reams of printer paper to do their work and it was time for a visual editor to take advantage of these wonderful CRT terminals allowing people to edit an entire screen of text at the same time!</p></div>



<div><p>Let me digress for a second on the assumption most 2020 humans make about using a text editor. Modern text editors (and word processors) are all, of course, visual, but are also called modeless. The computer figures out what you want to do by the way you interact. Start typing? The computer assumes you want to insert text. Click somewhere in the text? The computer assumes you want to move the location of insertion. Menus give you all sorts of commands and the computer knows by the nature of your mouse (or trackpad, if you prefer) actions and movements what you want to do and when you want to do it.</p><p>But Bill Joy’s computer did not have a mouse. His great insight was to recognize that the computer with visual interaction couldn’t automatically recognize all these modes (remember, no mouse) and rather had to be instructed through the keyboard as to which mode needs to be used at what time and thus the modal editor called vi (originally the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">visual part of the line editor ex</a>) was born.</p><p>It is important to note that as frustrating as modern modeless text editors find the modal aspect of vi, this was such a huge leap beyond line editors that people flocked to it with glee. Those interested in context, and I don’t do this with my students, should consider playing a bit with <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-ed-command/">ed</a> on their favorite Linux or UNIX system. Then imagine doing this with a line printer. You can even get somewhat of a feel for both line editing and a printer terminal on old school UNIX with this <a href="http://aiju.de/code/pdp11/">web based PDP-11 emulator</a>.</p><p>Please note this historical context is vitally important as students rarely think about how their modeless editors work and throwing them into a modal editor without knowing about modes is one of the primary reasons so many students find vim so impenetrable. All the commands in the world won’t help if you do not understand <em>why</em> there are modes. This is even more further compounded by the fact that switching modes is something that is almost entirely unseen when a teacher is using vim in front of students. As both an undergraduate and graduate student, I have had the experience of watching a teacher just start using vi or vim and explicitly or implicitly telling students to figure it out. This. Rarely. Works. In fact, as the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25097788">discussion on my original post</a> points out, this can be recipe for bias against students who lack outside resources. vim is not difficult, but it does have to be explicitly taught.</p><p>At this point, I will go into a bit of how I teach the mechanics of vim. I am assuming the student can ssh into a command line machine now (or open up a command prompt on their machine). I am also assuming they can change their password (passwd), make a directory (mkdir),  and change into that directory (cd). I then ask them to type:</p></div>



<pre><code>vi hello.txt</code></pre>



<p>vi is almost always mapped to vim. If you end up with vi, which is easy enough to tell because vi doesn’t do syntax coloring of your favorite programming language and vim does, you may need to install vim on your particular system. Happily, if you only have vi, besides the color syntax, this guide will work just fine. Certainly consider reading more about the <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/05/where-vim-came-from.html">history of vi and vim</a>, if you are interested.</p>



<p>At this point, <em>you are in command mode</em>.</p>

<p>And here is where we get into the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/25x8bm/finally_found_a_vim_joke/">running joke</a> about how impossible it is to exit vim. Students must understand they are in <em>command mode</em>. Absolutely nothing interesting (yet) can happen in command mode, so we have to give it a command. The first command we will learn is i. Yes, just the letter i. This puts us in <em>insert</em> <em>mode.</em></p>

<div><p>The obvious question is, of course, how do we now save it? This is a perfect time to remind students that vim is <em>modal</em> and that we are in insert mode right now. If we using a modeless text editor, we could click on maybe the file menu and choose save. What ever shall we do?</p><p>Why, switch modes, of course! To exit insert mode and reenter command mode we simply type the esc key (be careful, students will sometimes literally type e… s… c…). Notice that by pressing the esc key we lose the — INSERT — in the lower right hand corner and move back into command mode.</p></div>

<p>At this point, I explain that in lieu of menus we use the : character (and not the ; character, English teachers all over the world will thank you for explaining that there is, indeed, a big difference and, for my young students, I always make a point of encouraging them to ask their English teacher what the difference is).</p>

<p>This now allows us to choose commands. I always start with the w command (for write file… s for save would have made life more easy for future people teaching vim, but s is used for <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace">substitute</a> – not covered in this guide). I then have students type w and then hit enter/return.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="163" data-permalink="https://blog.ceos.io/vim-saved/" data-orig-file="https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png" data-orig-size="1045,554" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vim-saved" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=750" src="https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=1024 1024w, https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=150 150w, https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=300 300w, https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=768 768w, https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png 1045w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A new file is born!</figcaption></figure>



<p>I then have them repeat the sequence esc, :, followed by q (to quit) and return/enter. Experienced vim users will point out the esc is unnecessary (we are already in command mode), but an extra esc here or there to reinforce this idea of command mode seems to be very helpful to students new to vim. Experienced vim users will also point out you can chain commands i.e. esc followed by :wq. I do share this later on, but prefer to associate each command with the equivalent menu selection for beginners. This ability to chain commands is one of most important reasons why people like vim, though, and is something I definitely cover in the long run. Who wants to do File-&gt;Save, File-&gt;Quit with the mouse when you can do esc, :wq return?!</p>



<p>At this point I teach the students the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cat-command-in-linux-with-examples/">cat</a> command and ask them to type to see the fruits of their labor:</p>



<pre><code>cat hello.txt</code></pre>



<p>Finally, to reinfornce everything we have done so far, I ask them to type:</p>



<pre><code>vi hello.txt</code></pre>



<p>and then change the Hello, World! text to something of their own creation by first going into insert mode (i) and then saving (writing, if you prefer) it (esc, :w, return – remember that the esc moves you to command mode!), and then quitting (esc, :q, return). Students are then asked to cat their new hello.txt to be sure they saved what they wrote.</p>



<div><p>Repetition is the key to learning all this and I quickly follow up by giving them a C hello world program and asking them to vi hello.c and input it. <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a> will quickly tell them if they have made any typical mistakes!</p><p>More about why and how I teach C at a later date, but the key trick here is to give them a very text intensive first programming assignment. I often have students write a program that prints out their class schedule. The secret here is that the goal isn’t so much printf in C but rather practicing vim to the point of reasonable automaticity. </p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was doing some research at work for tracing and observability for microservices, when I came across <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/">Pixielabs</a>. This tool advertises that you can instantly troubleshoot applications without any instrumentation or special code inside the apps, which sounded ✨magical✨ to me. So naturally I wanted to know a little more about what enables this technology to work, and after scrolling through the site, under the “No Instrumentation” section was this acronym <strong>eBPF</strong>.</p><p>After some further digging on the internet, reading the <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">design papers</a> and watching several videos, it was safe to say this technology caught my attention, so I wanted to write some notes on it and I hope this post will spark some further interest in you as well.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-ebpf-exactly">So what is eBPF exactly?</h2><p>The TL;DR version is that this technology enables sandboxed user space applications to run in the Linux kernel itself. In a way it makes the kernel <em>programmable</em> which unlocks tremendous possibilities.</p><p>You can pick <strong>any function</strong> from the kernel and execute the program every time that function runs. Running a program that “attaches” to network sockets, tracepoints and perf events can be extremely useful. Developers can debug the kernel without having to re-compile it. There are plenty of use cases such as:</p><ul><li>Application performance &amp; troubleshooting</li><li>Networking &amp; security</li><li>Runtime security</li><li>Application tracing</li><li>Observability</li></ul><p>That’s what enables tools like Pixie to do blackbox analysis, without requiring any tinkering inside the applications that we’re trying to debug.</p><p>Originally BPF was <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">designed</a> for capturing and filtering network packets that matched specific rules, discarding any unwanted packets. That’s why it was called the “Berkeley Packet Filter”. If you’ve ever used <strong>tcpdump</strong> you’ve probably already used it. Nowadays eBPF can be used for many different things and not just packet filtering but the name stuck for some reason.</p><p>This architecture of network monitoring was vastly superior to the current existing packet capture technologies in terms of performance, mainly because the filtering was done in the kernel instead of copying all of the packets in user space and doing
the calculations there. But with the advancement of processors it didn’t hold up so well with it’s initial design. That’s why the <strong>extended BPF</strong> (eBPF) design was introduced, to take advantage of the modern processing power.</p><p>Initially eBPF was to be also used as a network packet filtering solution, but the ability to run user-space programs inside the kernel proved to be very powerful. The new design extended what the BPF virtual machine could do, which was to allow it to run on all kinds of events, not just packets, and also do certain actions instead of just the ability to filter things.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>An eBPF program is just a sequence of 64-bit instructions. The virtual machine’s instruction set is fairly limited and it has two goals in mind:</p><ol><li>The code needs to be executed as fast as possible.</li><li>All BPF instructions must be verifiable at load time to ensure the safety of the kernel.</li></ol><p>Okay so, eBPF code is run in a safe virtual machine inside the kernel. Writing these programs is done with the help of some frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">bcc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>) and the program bytecode is then loaded via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><code>bpf</code></a> system call.</p><p>To nullify the security and stability risks when running a user space program inside the kernel, several checks are performed
to ensure that the code we run is safe and that it terminates so our computer won’t freeze up.</p><p>Firstly, to even be able to run a user program which loads eBPF code, it needs root privileges to do so, unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, in which case the process can load a program with a reduced functionality. Secondly, there’s the eBPF verifier which all eBPF programs must go through before they can be executed.</p><p>The verifier runs several checks on the code that safeguards the kernel. The first check ensures that any unbounded
loops which could freeze up the kernel are prohibited. The second check, which is more extensive, simulates the execution of the code making sure that all paths of the code run to completion, no out of bounds memory is accessed and overall the state of the virtual machine is valid.</p><p>The last step of the verification process involves restricting the eBPF program abilities, which kernel functions are callable and which data it can access. The verifier knows how to apply those restrictions because of the <strong>program type</strong>. The program type is determined when we associate the program with a certain event.</p><p>After the verification process is done, the BPF bytecode is then interpreted, or compiled by a JIT compiler, into native instructions that run efficiently whenever an event happens in the kernel.</p><h2 id="kprobes--uprobes">kprobes &amp; uprobes</h2><p>We can create and insert kernel probes or kprobes for short to virtually any function in the kernel, and attach an eBPF program so that it executes each time that function is invoked.</p><p>Here’s a simple hello world example from the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/examples">bcc</a> repository:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> bcc <span>import</span> BPF

</code></pre></div><p>The eBPF program is written in a pseudo-C code and it’s placed in the variable <code>prog</code> as a string. The bcc framework does all the heavy lifting of generating the bytecode, loading the programs and all that stuff, which makes writing these programs a bit easier.</p><p>In this example, the hello function invokes a bpf helper function called <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> which outputs a “Hello, World!” trace. Then we load the program and we attach a kernel probe for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><code>clone</code></a> event, basically saying that we want to call the <code>hello</code> program each time <code>clone</code> is called.</p><p>After that the script waits for new traces to arrive, fetches the fields and prints the values to the screen.</p><p>Let’s try running it:</p><pre><code>$ sudo python3 hello-ebpf.py
TIME(s)            COMM             PID    MESSAGE
</code></pre><p>The script has successfully loaded the program and now we wait for the traces to arrive. The next thing to do is to try and invoke the <code>clone</code> syscall. We can run any command on the terminal, such as <code>ls</code> and a child process will be created. Since I had firefox running, it created some child processes in the meantime and traces started to show up:</p><pre><code>611.247475000      firefox          5378   Hello, World!
</code></pre><p>As we can see, the message “Hello, World!” is printed on the screen along with the other trace fields. Super cool!</p><p>Besides attaching to kernel functions, we could also observe functions invoked in user space, such as <strong>malloc</strong> or <strong>strlen</strong>. This is possible via another Linux kernel feature - <strong>uprobes</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an interesting script that counts frequencies of strings by tracing strlen() and using a hash map to store the strings along with the count of their recurrence: <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py">https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py</a></p><h2 id="helper-functions">helper functions</h2><p>Since arbitrary kernel functions are prohibited to be called by ebpf programs, there are several helper functions which the kernel provides for us, such as the <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> function. We can use them to:</p><ul><li>Get the current time</li><li>Interact with eBPF maps</li><li>Manipulate network packets</li><li>Print debugging messages</li></ul><p>Note that each program can only use a subset of these helpers because of the different contexts the programs can run in. Here’s the extensive <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">list</a> of bpf helpers.</p><h2 id="map-storage">map storage</h2><p>To write more complicated programs you’ll need some type of data store, and that is where <strong>maps</strong> come in.

<p>
I don’t usually talk about money, but a friend asked me what it was like to get rich, and he wanted to know specifics, so I told him my story.
</p><p>
I had <a href="https://sive.rs/xn">a day job</a> in midtown Manhattan paying $20K per year — about minimum wage.
On weekends I would earn $150 per day performing circus shows for kids, though I’d spend about $50 in bus fare to get to the gigs.
I was sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates in Queens, so our rent was $333 per month each.
I made peanut butter sandwiches for three meals a day, and at night maybe some eggs.
I never ate out, and never took a taxi.
<strong>
My cost of living was about $1000/month, and I was earning $1800/month.
I did this for two years, and saved up $12,000.
</strong>
I was 22 years old.
</p><p>
Once I had $12,000 I could quit my job and become a full-time musician.
I knew I could get a few gigs per month to pay my cost of living.
So I was free.
<a href="https://sive.rs/nq">I quit my job</a> a month later, and never had a job again.
</p><p>
When I finished telling my friend this story, he asked for more.
I said no, that was it.
He said, “No, what about when you sold your company?”
</p><p>
I said no, that didn’t make a big difference in my life.
That was just more money in the bank.
The difference happened when I was 22.

It’s not how much you have.
<strong>
It’s the difference between what you have and what you spend.

If you have more than you spend, you’re rich.
If you spend more than you have, you’re not.
If you live cheaply, it’s easy to be free.

November 21, 2020 | https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/meta/pagination-in-zola/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/meta/pagination-in-zola/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I've been experimenting with Zola, a static site generator. The documentation for pagination is pretty good from an anatomical perspective, but I thought there was room for something a little more 'recipe' like. So, this is how I personally implemented pagination on my Zola site, aiming to demonstrate the nuts and bolts in action. This demonstration will be correct for zola binaries compatible with 0.12.0.</p>
<h2 id="the-goal">The Goal<a href="#the-goal" aria-label="Anchor Link For: the-goal">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Imagine a homepage, much like the one <a href="https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/">for this site</a>. Let's assume there's 15 posts, sorted by most recent posts first, but we don't want to overwhelm the user or have them scroll forever, so we'd like to display a maximum of five posts at once. We need to be able to click on the posts themselves to get to the articles, but also we want to make it possible to see beyond the most recent five posts.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-the-index-page">Configuring the index page<a href="#configuring-the-index-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: configuring-the-index-page">
    
</a></h2>
<p>These index pages are configured by markdown frontmatter. So at the root of your content directory, you'll want a file, <code>_index.md</code>, who's sole purpose is to configure how to render a particular section. Now by creating this file at the root of the entire content directory, the 'section' is essentially all of the content in the site - perfect for a homepage.</p>
<p>The frontmatter of this markdown page, is a set of attributes that must come at the start of every markdown file that Zola renders. These attributes are specified between two rows of three <code>+</code> characters, which Zola uses as the bookends for the frontmatter.</p>
<pre><code><span>+++
(ATTRIBUTES GO HERE)
+++
</span></code></pre>
<p>One attribute available to use is the <code>paginate_by</code> attribute, enabling us to specify how many posts per page should be rendered. In accordance with the goals set, we can make that 5.</p>
<pre><code><span>+++
paginate_by = 5
+++
</span></code></pre>
<p>To ensure the pages are sorted by date, we can also specify how to sort these pages. Let's do that.</p>
<pre><code><span>+++
sort_by = date
paginate_by = 5
+++
</span></code></pre>
<p>According to the documentation, the semantics of specifying the <code>sort_by</code> attribute to <code>date</code> are <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/#date">as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This will sort all pages by their date field, from the most recent (at the top of the list) to the oldest (at the bottom of the list). Each page will get page.earlier and page.later variables that contain the pages with earlier and later dates, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, all the configuration is in place to leverage pagination. However, before pagination actually works, we need to render this list of posts in a template. Now, we can specify the template in the frontmatter, but by default, for the root <code>_index.md</code> file, this will resolve to the root <code>index.html</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="rendering">Rendering<a href="#rendering" aria-label="Anchor Link For: rendering">
    
</a></h2>
<p>As a foundation, we'll build up the following template.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that this is an incredibly simplified template, with the goal of illustrating pagination. Your template probably will look different.</p>
<p>Zola makes certain variables available to each html template file. The variables we're concerned with are <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/pagination/">variables within the <code>paginator</code> namespace</a>. Now, the paginator namespace isn't guaranteed to be available to the template - if the <code>_index.md</code> file the template is rendering doesn't have any pagination settings enabled, the namespace won't exist.</p>
<h3 id="safety-measures">Safety measures<a href="#safety-measures" aria-label="Anchor Link For: safety-measures">
    
</a></h3>
<p>As a precautionary measure, we can check if it exists before trying to do anything with it. In Zola, we can run any templating logic between curly braces with percentage symbols inside, like so:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h3 id="listing-pages">Listing Pages<a href="#listing-pages" aria-label="Anchor Link For: listing-pages">
    
</a></h3>
<p>We can now write any and all logic related to pagination between these two added lines, and safely interact with the paginator namespace. There exists a variable on the paginator, <code>pages</code>, which corresponds to an array of pages. We can list these pages out 'iterator' style - let's just list out some basic links with the corresponding dates. It should look like the code below:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>At this point, the homepage renders up to 5 posts at once, with the most recent posts first. Great start, but we need to enable users to get to the older pages should they so desire - this is the actual pagination part!</p>

<p>The <code>paginator</code> namespace exposes pretty much all the variables we need for this. It would be good to display the current page, and some links to the next and previous pages if there are any. If there aren't, we can either leave off the buttons entirely or go with disabling them - I'm going to render disabled buttons. To achieve all this, we're going to need three variables from the <code>paginator</code> namespace - <code>previous</code>, <code>next</code> and <code>current_index</code>.</p>
<p>Let's get these done in order.</p>
<h4 id="previous-page">Previous Page<a href="#previous-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: previous-page">
    
</a></h4>
<p>The <code>paginator.previous</code> variable corresponds to a link to the previous page, if such a page exists - so we'll check if it exists, and if it exists, render a link to the page with the text 'previous', and if it doesn't exist, display a disabled version of the same link. For the disabled version, instead of linking to the page,</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
      {% if paginator.previous %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.previous }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;lt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;lt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h4 id="current-page">Current Page<a href="#current-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: current-page">
    
</a></h4>
<p>This is pretty easy - we pretty much just render <code>paginator.current_index</code> into the page.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
      {% if paginator.previous %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.previous }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;lt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;lt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
      &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{ paginator.current_index }}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h4 id="next-page">Next Page<a href="#next-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: next-page">
    
</a></h4>
<p>Here, we can pretty much do what we did with the 'previous' page example.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
      {% if paginator.previous %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.previous }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;lt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;lt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
      &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{ paginator.current_index }}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator.next %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.next }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;gt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;gt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h2 id="calling-it">Calling It<a href="#calling-it" aria-label="Anchor Link For: calling-it">
    
</a></h2>
<p>This is a minimal implementation for a homepage that renders up to five pages, and allows clicking through to view other pages, using Zola. This should be sufficient as a starting point for expanding on, customising and styling. I'm looking to move this blog to something Zola flavored, and I'll talk about why in the future - suffice to say, I'm pleased with how easy pagination is to roll out.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you run any kind of moderately successful website, it's not long before these types of emails
start showing up in your inbox:</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/toptal-email.jpg" alt="Link building email"></p><p>You might wonder to yourself, "Why is someone who works at Toptal suggesting that I link to a random article from one of my blog posts?"</p><p>The answer is that this person is doing something called <strong>link building</strong>.</p><p>When it comes to SEO, having external links pointing to your website or article can help you rank higher
in Google. In a big way.</p><p>In this example, Toptal is trying to rank an article about PHP hiring. And the reason they asked me to include
a link to that in that specific article isn't because they actually think it's a great post.</p><p>It's because my article about being a junior developer has a bunch of external links to it. These are called "backlinks".</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/tech-blog-best-pages-by-links.jpg" alt="My tech blog's top pages by links"></p><p>Whether you're an indie hacker trying to get organic traffic to your SaaS, info product, or service, or
a developer trying to get visitors or freelance clients on your tech blog, this article will put you on the
path to do just that.</p><p>You are about to learn <strong>how to build these coveted backlinks to your blog or website</strong>,
why they are so important for SEO, how to figure out which websites and pages
offer links that actually help you rank, and 17 <em>specific</em> strategies for
building them that work.</p><p>Most importantly, you'll be able to do all this without suggesting irrelevant resources
or creating more spam in bloggers' inboxes (sorry, Toptal).</p><h2>Why backlinks are so important for SEO</h2><p>Backlinks are important for SEO because Google treats links from external websites like an "upvote" for the quality of the content.</p><p>The more authoritative a website is (in large part, how many backlinks it has and from whom), the more "votes" it bestows upon
the websites that it links to.</p><p>This is a bit of an oversimplification, but let's take a look at a concrete example.</p><p>Think about how many articles have been written on the topic of "ReactJS Tutorial". </p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/reactjs-tutorial-query-results.jpg" alt="ReactJS tutorial search results analysis"></p><p>Google has over 7 million articles indexed on the topic.</p><p>How does it decide which articles are worthy of being on the first page of the search results, much less
which deserves to be number one?</p><p>Backlinks are part of the answer.</p><h2>How Google chooses which articles to rank (as far as we know)</h2><p>Google uses <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors" target="_blank">over 200 ranking factors</a> to
determine which article gets the top spot.</p><p>These include things like the presence of the keyword in the title
tag and H1 tag, site speed, freshness (how recently the content was published or updated), and many other factors.</p><p>But not all factors are equally weighted.</p><p>However, time and again we observe that backlinks (especially backlinks from different domains) strongly correlate with higher rankings in Google.
They may not be <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-links-not-most-important-google-ranking-factor-29868.html" target="_blank">the most important factor</a>, but they are important <!-- -->—<!-- --> and the data shows that.</p><p>One <a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank">study</a> of 11.8 million search results found this:</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/backlink-position-correlation.png" alt="Backlink position correlation graph"></p><blockquote><p>Pages with lots of backlinks rank above pages that don’t have as many backlinks. In fact, the #1 result in Google has an average of 3.8x more backlinks than positions #2-#10. (<a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Here are three reasons why links can be an effective way for Google to determine which article
among millions is the best:</p><ul><li><strong>They're hard to get.</strong> Quality backlinks from authoritative websites are difficult to obtain (meaning, difficult to manipulate). You can't just email the New York Times and ask for a link to your blog.</li><li><strong>They pass along useful context.</strong> If I run a website about web development, a backlink from CSS Tricks or Mozilla Developer Network reinforces to Google that my site is about web development.</li><li><strong>Natural links represent a human's opinion.</strong> If someone links to an article just because they find it handy, that represents to Google that it probably contains quality information.</li></ul><p>Let's look at the backlinks for the top-ranking articles for "ReactJS Tutorial":</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/reactjs-tutorial-backlinks.jpg" alt="Backlinks to articles ranking for ReactJS tutorial"></p><p>You can see that the #1 article is on the official ReactJS website and has over 9,000 backlinks from 2,000+ different domains.</p><p>This makes perfect sense: it's the official documentation, making it naturally the most relevant, authoritative, and linked-to
article about "reactjs tutorial".</p><p>But what about topics that don't have a clear entity behind them?</p><p>Let's look at the kinds of queries you might pop into Google on a regular basis: CSS properties.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why W3 Schools would <em>ever</em> show up above MDN when you google for these?</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/w3schools-vs-mdn.jpg" alt="W3 Schools vs MDN by backlinks"></p><p>Here's one possible explanation for you.</p><p>For fun, let's look at one last example: Toptal's article about PHP hiring.</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/hiring-php-developers-rankings.jpg" alt="Rankings for search term 'hiring php developers'"></p><p>They have clearly been building links to this page, and are able to rank higher than sites
like Indeed and Upwork for this search query.</p><p>Ignoring any on-site factors, it could be hard for the other sites to outrank
Toptal without building more links themselves for "hiring php developers".</p><p><strong>In effect: Backlinks have likely helped Toptal obtain their ranking for this query.</strong></p><p>You can also imagine that the people searching for "hiring php developers" are exactly
the type of people Toptal would like to convert into clients. It makes sense.</p><p>Notably, they don't rank #1 for relevant search terms with higher volume like "php developer",
but I'm sure they're working on it ;)</p><p>Now the question is <!-- -->—<!-- --> how can we boost <em>ourselves</em> to the top of the search results for terms
that will bring readers or clients to our website, at least in part through backlinks?</p><h2>The most important SEO tactic that most developers have never heard of before</h2><p>It's not adding a ton of obscure meta tags or making your website load faster (believe it or not, neither schema nor pagespeed appear to <a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank">correlate</a> with higher rankings).</p><p>It's <strong>link building</strong>. What is that exactly?</p><blockquote><p>Link building is the deliberate effort to gain external links to your website, usually
through content marketing, outreach, PR campaigns, and creating "link-worthy" articles, graphics, and tools.</p></blockquote><p>Toptal's email to me is an (unsuccessful) attempt at link building.</p><p>They wrote me an outreach email, asking me to edit one of my existing articles to include
a link to their website.</p><p>While the official word from Google is that you should just "create great content" and
links will come, most of us are in agreement <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/marketers-say-most-of-googles-public-statements-are-false-or-misleading/" target="_blank">that's not how it works</a> in the real world, especially for new websites.</p><p>It takes a concerted effort to get links.</p><p>I'll be honest: it's a lot of work.</p><p>But think about it like this: Imagine you could write an article and feel <em>pretty confident</em>
it would drive revenue for your indie product, clients for your freelancing business,
or bring you readers that will subscribe to your newsletter, follow you on Twitter, or even offer you a job...</p><p><strong>All without you paying for ads or relying on a massive social media following.</strong></p><p>That's why SEO in general, and link building in particular, is so powerful and important.</p><p>And while I'm the first to bemoan the fact that <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/the-dirty-secret-to-ranking-1-on-google-part-1-of-3/" target="_blank">Google is making our lives harder</a>  when it comes to visibility in search, it's still
one of the most cost-effective and scalable ways to drive traffic to a website.</p><p>And to do that, there are specific strategies you can use to get links from great websites.</p><p>Links that will, in turn, signal to Google that your content is excellent and worth showing
to searchers.</p><p>I'll get to those specific strategies shortly, but first it's important to give you
a few <strong>techniques for determining whether a backlink from a website will be valuable for you</strong>.</p><p>That way you don't waste your time chasing links that won't move the needle.</p><h2>Why all backlinks are not created equal</h2><p>Imagine that Google treated the internet like a democracy: every link from every website has one, equal vote.</p><p>If you wanted a bunch of links to your website, you could just go create a repo on GitHub with
a markdown file and "send backlinks" to each page on your website you want to rank.</p><p>You could create dozens or even hundreds of repos to boost your rankings.</p><p>Or, hundreds of Tumblr pages, Twitter profiles, blogspot websites, you get the idea.</p><p>That doesn't make sense, does it? We both know you could probably code a script to automate that in less than a day (which is basically what people did).</p><p>This is similar to how Google's original <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/pagerank/" target="_blank">PageRank algorithm</a> used to work.</p><p>Instead of just looking at the content of your website, it also looked at how
many external links pointed to the website or web page (and how many links
pointed to those web pages, and so forth).
How many, but not necessarily the quality of the referring website.</p><p><strong>What it meant is that it was easy to build links (and rank your website) through spam</strong>: spam comments on blogs,
on forums, low quality sites created as so-called "link farms".</p><p>That's why Google introduced measures to rank based on the <strong>quality of links</strong>, starting with
the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Penguin" target="_blank">Penguin Update</a> in 2012.</p><p>Today, if you want links that are likely to improve your website's rankings, you should look at
a few factors first.</p><h2>How to tell if a backlink is useful for your website (or a waste of your time)</h2><p>Since I told you that building links is a lot of work, I want to make sure you're spending your time
efficiently and getting the most out of your effort.</p><p>We're going to look at backlink strategies, but it's important that for each strategy you apply, you <strong>look at the specific
website</strong> you'd be earning the link from and evaluate it.</p><p>Here are some of the most important factors to consider when deciding to pursue a backlink opportunity.</p><p>Some confirmed by Google, some denied (but that <a href="https://twitter.com/randfish/status/1288982615110725632" target="_blank">doesn't necessarily mean</a> they aren't accurate). </p><ul><li><strong>Relevance</strong> <!-- -->—<!-- --> Is the website covering the same topic as yours? Again, a link from CSS Tricks to my article
about "CSS Grid" would probably be more valuable than a link from, say, a link from Webflow. But both are
more relevant than a link from, say, the Financial Times, even if the latter is highly reputable (of course, don't turn down a link from the FT either).</li><li><strong>Domain-level Authority</strong> <!-- -->—<!-- --> Does the website linking to you have a lot of backlinks themselves? And if so, what's the
quality of those backlinks? One useful metric for estimating this is <a href="https://ahrefs.com/website-authority-checker" target="_blank">Ahrefs Domain Rating (DR)</a> (bearing in mind, this is a third-party metric
not actually included in Google's algorithm).</li><li><strong>Page-level …</strong></li></ul></div></div>

                        <p>Symmetric encryption with a default key on Ubiquiti’s UniFi network devices combined with remotely-hosted UniFi Controllers leads to risk of undetectable observation of network configuration and usage data.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-unifis-inform-protocol">Overview of UniFi’s “inform” protocol</h2>
<p>Ubiquiti’s UniFi product line consists of routers, switches, and WiFi access points.</p>
<p>These devices do not have any local management, instead relying on controller software<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> running locally or hosted remotely.</p>
<p>Devices discover their controller<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> through a combination of broadcast traffic on the local network, DHCP option 43, and trying to resolve the hostname <code>unifi</code>.
In the case of option 43 or resolution of the <code>unifi</code> hostname, the device will attempt to communicate with the controller by sending a HTTP POST request to <code>[ADDR]:8080/inform</code>.</p>
<p>This POST request contains a JSON payload<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and is repeated every 30 seconds. Controllers respond with a JSON payload containing configuration data, commands, or instructions to check in at a later time.</p>

<p>When sending JSON-encoded data to an API endpoint, one might expect to see a MIME type of <code>application/json</code> combined with HTTP over TLS. This is not the case.</p>
<p>Instead, the JSON payload is encrypted with AES in GCM or CBC mode depending on the combination of device and firmware version, wrapped with a bespoke binary protocol<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and transferred without benefit of TLS<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The encryption key used prior to adoption by a controller is the md5sum of <code>ubnt</code><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>During the adoption process, the controller generates a new key and sends it to the device as a inform response along with any other initial configuration data. Consequently, anyone observing network traffic during the adoption process can observe any future traffic between the device and controller.</p>
<p>Operators have been questioning<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Ubiquiti’s decision to not utilize TLS by default for several years. Eventually Ubiquiti removed<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> the ability for operators to force usage of TLS for inform traffic.</p>

<p>Network configuration data by itself can be considered sensitive but does not directly impact user privacy.
Unfortunately, inform traffic also contains data that can identify specific devices in place and time. With a UniFi router, it can associate browsing activity with a device’s mac and IP addresses.</p>
<h2 id="switches">Switches</h2>
<p>Switch tables contain MAC addresses of user devices and can be used to associate a user with a location.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://jade.wtf/words/unifi-l3inform-crypto/inform-switch.json">example inform</a> from a USW-PRO-24 running firmware 4.0.64.10823.</p>
<h2 id="wifi-access-points">WiFi Access Points</h2>
<p>MAC addresses of users, data on neighboring WiFi AP signal strength provides sufficient information to geolocate the AP<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> using commonly available services.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://jade.wtf/words/unifi-l3inform-crypto/inform-ap.json">example inform</a> from a UAP Flex HD running firmware 4.0.42.10433.</p>
<h2 id="routers-unifi-security-gateway">Routers (UniFi Security Gateway)</h2>
<p>Router inform contains DPI, DHCP, and ARP tables that can be used to associate a device with usage of specific applications such as Facebook and Spotify.</p>
<p>Exerpt showing DPI update for a host (<code>app</code> and <code>cat</code> correspond to application and category identifiers used in the controller dashboard):</p>

          <span>}</span>
     <span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Reliance on symmetric encryption means that anyone that possesses the key can observe inform traffic. This traffic contains information that, if disclosed, could have an adverse effect on users of the network.</p>
<h2 id="surveillance-and-targeting">Surveillance and targeting</h2>
<p>An aid worker installs a UniFi switch in a refugee camp. They use a UniFi controller hosted in a cloud VM for remote monitoring and management.
It’s easy for an adversary to monitor<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> these internet connection. The adversary gathers end-user device MAC addresses<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> from the switch table data contained in the inform message. How parties to a conflict could use such data is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h2 id="location-discovery-via-passive-observation-or-dns-hijacking">Location discovery via passive observation or DNS hijacking</h2>
<p>Someone acquires a UniFi WiFi access point (AP) and installs it on their home network. They didn’t realize that a controller was required and order a UniFi cloud key controller, but did not unplug the AP while waiting for the controller to arrive.</p>
<p>Their internet provider uses wildcard DNS monetization<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> to show ads on domain names that do not exist. This leads to the <code>unifi</code> hostname resolving to the monetization provider’s server. Because of privacy regulations the ISP is prohibited from giving detailed information (such as physical location) to the ad provider, so the ad provider is incentivized to find ways to geolocate clients to deliver more targeted ads.</p>
<p>The neighboring networks / interference avoidance data included in the AP’s inform message contains sufficient information to utilize WiFi-based geolocation to associate the IP address with a physical address.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the feasibility of information extraction, I built a tool to automate information extraction from Unifi inform packets: <a href="https://github.com/jda/pixiedust">pixiedust</a>.</p>
<p>In key extraction mode, pixiedust follows inform traffic and learns keys as devices are provisioned or reconfigured.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="short-term">Short-term</h2>
<p>Operators should ensure that traffic between UniFi devices and controllers is protected by a site-to-site VPN when traversing untrusted networks.</p>
<h2 id="long-term">Long-term</h2>
<p>Use TLS. Even self-signed certificates are better than the current state because you can log certificate IDs to detect MITM.</p>
<p>Inform messages should contain the minimum information necessary for adoption until after the device has been paired with a controller to prevent inadvertent disclosure of network configuration and personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>All UniFi devices to date are affected, except for the UniFi Dream Machine (UDM) product line (including UDM Pro).
The UDM series are not affected because they run a local instance of the controller software and cannot use a remotely hosted controller,
so there is no opportunity for an attacker to eavesdrop on UDM🡘controller communication.</p>

		<p>Sensitive files can be secured using different methods. It is important to understand the pros and cons of each in order to pick the best tool for your needs.</p>

<p>Most archival software has the capability to add a pass phrase for archive protection. Different tools use different encryption algorithms. It is important to also look for authenticated encryption or AEAD. It provides extra integrity verification that ensures the archive hasn’t been tampered with. Some of the tools that support archival encryption are:</p>
<ul>
<li>7-zip</li>
<li>WinZip</li>
<li>WinRaR</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Widely available</li>
<li>Difficult to manage pass phrases for many different archives</li>
<li>Most archival software doesn’t support authenticated encryption</li>
<li>Can be slow to add new files to an existing large archive</li>
</ul>

<p>Basic encryption tools don’t provide archival capabilities. Their main purpose is to encrypt a file. Each file is encrypted with its own pass phrase or your public key. There is support for file compression. Some of them are cross-platform and run on most operating system.</p>
<ul>
<li>PGP</li>
<li>AxCrypt (not open source)</li>
<li>AES Crypt</li>
<li>openssl (for advanced users)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.secure-monkey.com/the-future-of-file-utilities-encryption-hashing-and-compression-in-the-browser/">Open Source File Encryption Tools in the Browser</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to install and use</li>
<li>Difficult to manage different pass phrases for each file</li>
<li>PGP is complex and requires careful understanding of its configuration</li>
<li>Some of the tools in this category don’t support authenticated encryption</li>
</ul>

<p>Some applications provide their own file protection as part of their interface. The protection mechanisms vary between different applications. In the past various applications were having issues protecting files. For example the encryption of Word documents before Office 2003&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_password_protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">was insecure</a>. Examples of application specific encryption:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password protected Word, Excel, PowerPoint files</li>
<li>Password protected PDFs</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>These applications already support encryption so it is convenient to use it out of the box</li>
<li>It is hard to manage passwords for different files</li>
<li>Some applications provide very weak security by using old and vulnerable algorithms
<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> The encryption of Word documents before Office 2003 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_password_protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">is insecure</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There can be version mismatch where a file is encrypted with different version of the software and can’t be opened</li>
</ul>

<p>Encrypted volumes are much easier to work with. The volume is just a flat file on your disk so you can move it anywhere. When mounted the volume appears as a regular drive on your operating system. You can add/delete/edit files with ease. The user needs a single pass phrase to mount the volume and this applies to all added files. Volumes can be mounted and umounted at any time.</p>
<ul>
<li>VeraCrypt</li>
<li>TrueCrypt (deprecated)</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a single password to open the volume can simplify working with many encrypted files</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Fixed size of each volume that can’t grow dynamically can be frustrating</li>
<li>Not optimized for cloud storage – if a single file changes then the whole contents of the volume needs to be synced to the cloud</li>
</ul>

<p>Full Drive Encryption is great for preventing a stolen drive or laptop from being accessed without the passphrase. It depends what drive is encrypted. If it is the boot drive then as soon as the drive is booted into the operating system it is no longer protected as a logged-in user has complete access to all the files. The only way to protect your encrypted boot drive is to shutdown your computer. If a partition is encrypted then once it is “mounted” it appears as a drive on your OS. Most modern operating systems already have support for FDE and it is fairly simple to turn on. It does add a pace of mind that your data is protected if you lose your laptop. Some tools allow for hidden partitions that can add additional security to your files.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bit Locker (Windows)</li>
<li>Veracrypt (Cross-Platform)</li>
<li>File Vault (Mac OS X)</li>
<li>dm-crypt (Linux)</li>
<li>PGP Full Disk Encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Doesn’t protect files that are copied out of the encrypted disk</li>
<li>Doesn’t protect files on mounted volumes for the logged-in user</li>
<li>Not applicable to cloud storage as it only works on the physical disk or partition</li>
</ul>

<p>Encryption tools that are optimized for the cloud provide many additional benefits over the previously discussed tools. First, they are optimized for synchronization to cloud storage. Only the changed parts of the encrypted files are uploaded to the cloud. Second, they are using modern security algorithms such as authenticated encryption and public key cryptography. They allow managing and sharing encrypted files with ease. They work with different cloud storage providers so you’re not locked into one of them. They also provide local file protection.</p>
<ul>
<li>SecureMyFiles – <a href="http://www.secure-monkey.com/">www.secure-monkey.com</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>BoxCryptor</li>
<li>Cryptomator</li>
<li>GoCryptFs</li>
<li>KeybaseFS</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>State of the art encryption</li>
<li>Cloud integration</li>
<li>Efficient network synchronization</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Can support large files</li>
<li>Allow easy password management and file sharing using public key encryption</li>
<li>Protect local and cloud files</li>
</ul>

<p>Secure Cloud Providers can offer various encryption mechanisms. The best ones use client-side encryption that protects your files before they are uploaded to the cloud. But the files are not encrypted on the client computer but rather only when uploaded to the cloud provider. Once the files are on the cloud server they stays encrypted at rest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sync.com</li>
<li>pCloud</li>
<li>Tresorit</li>
<li>ShareFile</li>
<li>NextCloud</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide backup capabilities as well as encryption</li>
<li>Can be used to share files securely</li>
<li>Can be used to synchronize files across multiple devices</li>
<li>Requires a separate account</li>
<li>Doesn’t work with existing cloud providers such as Dropbox or Google Drive</li>
<li>Force you to purchase secure file storage from them</li>
<li>Don’t encrypt the files on the client computer</li>
</ul>

<p>Secure File Sharing can take the form of a secure cloud storage provider or as a specialized tool aimed directly at file sharing. Different tools provide different capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox Send (depricated)</li>
<li>Citrix ShareFile</li>
<li>Signal</li>
<li>Wire</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be used to easily and securely send files to other users</li>
<li>Some of them have size limitations</li>
<li>Additional complexity in managing users</li>
<li>Don’t provide encryption at rest</li>
</ul>

<p>Securing email is hard. It is an old protocol that doesn’t natively support encryption. The best way to secure your emails is to use an extra mail plugin that runs in Outlook or Thunderbird or use a secure email provider. Nowadays secure email providers provide much better user experience with many options to secure your messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>ProtonMail</li>
<li>PGP plugin for Outlook/Thunderbird</li>
<li>Hushmail</li>
<li>Mailfence</li>
<li>Tutanota</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">S/MIME</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Popular mean for sharing files</li>
<li>Can encrypt the body and attachments of emails</li>
<li>The password for decrypting the file has to be communicated using another method (out of band)</li>
<li>The user needs to have the same tools in order to decrypt the message</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to realize that we have the ability to manufacture our own fate when we want to. We can… proceed when things look bad, or we can find plenty of reasons to quit if we don’t want to go forward.</p>
<p><br>– Eric Haney, Inside Delta Force</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This post was inspired by&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3jS2BK6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Inside Delta Force</a>, written by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_L._Haney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eric Haney</a>.&nbsp;Detailed notes and quotes can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/inside-delta-force-haney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Unattributed quotes below are from Haney’s writing.</em></p>
<p>After numerous terrorism incidents in the 1970s, the United States realized its armed forces had a blind spot when it came to counterterrorism. Green Beret <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Alvin_Beckwith" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Colonel Charlie Beckwith</a>, who had served alongside the British Army’s counter-terrorism unit the Special Air Service (also known as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SAS</a>“) in Malaysia, had been pushing for such a group since the 1960s. Now that the opportunity to be proactive had passed, the U.S. Army decided it was a good time to commission its own SAS-like force – namely, <a href="https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/this-long-forgotten-unit-was-the-direct-predecessor-to-delta-force#:~:text=The%20US%20Army's%20highly%20secretive,American%20counterterrorist%20force%20in%20existence." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delta Force</a>.</p>
<p>That brings us to Eric Haney. Haney had a successful start to his career, joining the army straight out of high school and progressing to platoon sergeant in the Army Rangers. In 1977, he was fretting that he would wind up as an instructor given his combat experience could be put to use training subsequent Ranger generations. After jumping out of an airplane as part of a drill, he stumbled into the opportunity to try out for one of the first Delta Force squadrons.</p>
<p>These tryouts are a continuous string of examples showcasing the often-said-not-often-followed truism that hard work and persistence are the bare minimum qualities required to achieve anything meaningful. There were run-of-the-mill running tests, an 18-mile hike with 40 pounds on your back, solo navigation drills across mountains and valleys ad nauseum, and it all culminated with a 40-mile mountain hike starting at 2am. And to top it all off, the testing officers were constantly encouraging the soldiers to quit along the way while never telling you how close to the finish line you were.</p>
<p>And what a beautiful metaphor for life that is. Your destination is never truly known, it requires unending effort to achieve things worth achieving and along the way you can easily find sources of negativity telling you to voluntarily remove yourself from the challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What was the lesson here? Simple. Don’t quit. Never quit no matter what. Keep going until someone tells you to sit down. Keep going as long as you’re able to move, no matter how poorly you think you may be doing. Just don’t quit.</p>

<p>– Eric Haney, Inside Delta Force</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, how did Haney do? He succeeded by focusing on the task at hand and ignoring the things around him that didn’t matter. Everytime he was close to quitting, he would push himself a little further, get his second wind and keep on trucking. He would “just keep [his] mouth shut, [his] eyes and ears open, and respond to whatever came up. It’s the system [he’d] always used in new situations, and so far it had served [him] well.”</p>
<p>Additionally, as he attacked what was in front of him he pushed away the temptation to look around and worry about comparing himself to other applicants. Some were faster. Some were stronger. Some seemed to mind the pain less than he did. But, to Haney, “the men in the other group weren’t my concern, and as for me, I’d know the destination when I got there.” And he got to the destination while many others did not.</p>
<p>And as you think through how impossible these challenges sound, you are are met with the realization of how quickly you would fail participating in the same. But then you have to be honest with yourself – you wouldn’t just fail, you would, in fact, die. You would get lost in the mountains. You would fall off a cliff. You would try to make the 40-miles and breakdown before you ever got to the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this highlights another useful truth – unending resolve is not enough to ensure success. You must also be competent. All the perseverance you can muster today won’t do anything for you if you haven’t lived a life up to today that has prepared you for the task at hand – <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/habits-maketh-the-man-and-un-maketh-him-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who you are today is a lagging indicator of your</a><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/habits-maketh-the-man-and-un-maketh-him-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> habits </a>.</p>
<p>This means that success can only come after persistent preparation. The 163 men selected for the tryouts had lived lives that prepared them to take the unique, once-in-a-lifetime Delta Force opportunity and try. Without preparation, they could not even hope to try.</p>
<p>This is not unique to the military – <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/invert-always-invert-avoid-failure-to-succeed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Munger</a> consistently shares the idea that there are only a few opportunities in life that define you. To take advantage of them, you prepare so that “step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/charlie-mungers-career-advice-for-young-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts</a>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts.</p>

<p>– Charlie Munger</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even with preparation you will make mistakes. Haney did just that on the final 40-mile hike. He got lost. He went 7 miles off course in the wrong direction. And had to backtrack. And then keep going. He turned a 40-mile hike into more than a 50-mile hike, but he finished. After 18 hours of hiking, he made it to the finish line despite the setback.</p>
<p>This is another lesson – it is rare that failure is a permanent state. After failure, you have the option to keep going. You can treat failure as only a stop on your journey. You don’t have to let it be the destination. Many people treat getting knocked down as a reason to stay down. Like Haney, we don’t have to.</p>
<p>And it is important in life that you don’t define failure as failure to achieve only one specific goal. You can show up prepared and still not cross a specific finish line. 163 men participated in the Delta Force trials, but only 12 were ultimately accepted into the program. Those 151 men were not failures – not even close. They just had to accept that this Delta Force finish line wasn’t one they were going to cross and instead start progressing towards the next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>This post was prompted by a tweet by Frank Harrell yesterday asking:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In this post I'll say a little bit about trying to answer Frank's question, and then a little bit about an alternative question which I posed in response, namely, how does the interpretation change if the interval is a Bayesian credible interval, rather than a frequentist confidence interval.</p>



<h2>Frequentist confidence intervals</h2>



<p>A frequentist 95% confidence interval is constructed such that if the model assumptions are correct, if you were to (hypothetically) repeat the experiment or sampling many many times, 95% of the intervals constructed would contain the true value of the parameter. I made a short video last year which performs a simulation in R to demonstrate this definition/idea:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="1125" height="633" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGXg6L98lJM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Frank asked how one interprets a particular realised confidence interval (0.72,0.91). The difficulty (as he is well aware!) is that all a frequentist can say is that this particular realised interval either does or does not contain the true parameter value, and they cannot tell you if it does or doesn't. All they can say is that if modelling assumptions are correct, in hypothetical repetitions 95% of the intervals constructed using this procedure contain the true value.</p>



<h2>Bayesian credible intervals</h2>



<p>Let’s now suppose that we’ve done a Bayesian analysis. We’ve specified a prior distribution for the parameter, based on prior evidence, our subjective beliefs about the value of the parameter, or perhaps we used a default ‘non-informative’ prior built into our software package. We use the same model as before, and Bayes theorem gives us the posterior distribution. A Bayesian posterior credible interval is constructed, and suppose it gives us some values. For the sake of simplicity, I’ll assume the interval is again 0.72 to 0.91, but this is not done to suggest a Bayesian analysis credible interval will generally be identical to the frequentist's confidence interval.</p>



<p>How should we interpret this credible interval? A Bayesian would I think say say something like it is an interval for which there is a 95% chance or probability the true parameter lies. At this point we must ask, what do they mean by 95% probability?</p>



<p>We could interpret it as a classical long run frequentist probability, but this means interpreting it like a confidence interval. In fact Bayesian procedures often have good frequentist properties. For example see <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/343/2013/03/large-sample.pdf" target="_blank">Wang and Robins 1998</a> for an analysis of the frequentist properties of multiple imputation for missing data, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0962280216667764" target="_blank">Bartlett and Keogh 2018</a> for a simulation investigation of the frequentist properties of Bayesian approaches for handling covariate measurement error. In fact, under certain conditions, Bayesian procedures achieve the same frequentist properties of maximum likelihood methods when the sample size gets large - see Chapter 4 of Gelman <em>et al</em>'s excellent<a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bayesian Data Analysis book</a>.</p>



<p>But conceptually we do not choose to do a Bayesian analysis simply as a means to performing frequentist inference. We choose it because it (hopefully) answers more directly what we are interested in (see Frank Harrell's '<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fharrell.com/post/journey/" target="_blank">My Journey From Frequentist to Bayesian Statistics</a>' post). Namely, it enables us to make probability statements about the unknown parameter given our model, the prior, and the data we have observed. So what is the interpretation of the 95% chance or probability for a credible interval? </p>



<p>I don't know the no doubt large literature on this topic well at all, but the Bayesian's interpretation or definition of probability isn't that clear to me. The Wikipedia entry on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability" target="_blank">Bayesian probability</a> says:</p>



<blockquote><p>Broadly speaking, there are two interpretations of Bayesian probability. For objectivists, who interpret probability as an extension of logic, probability quantifies the reasonable expectation that everyone (even a "robot") who shares the same knowledge should share in accordance with the rules of Bayesian statistics, which can be justified by Cox's theorem.[2][8] For subjectivists, probability corresponds to a personal belief.[3] Rationality and coherence allow for substantial variation within the constraints they pose; the constraints are justified by the Dutch book argument or by decision theory and de Finetti's theorem.[3] The objective and subjective variants of Bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability.</p><cite>Wikipedia entry on Bayesian probability</cite></blockquote>



<p>Section 1.5 'Probability as a measure of uncertainty' of <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bayesian Data Analysis</a> talks about the way Bayesian analysis uses probability as a measure of uncertainty, but to my mind it doesn't really define the concept. This is not a criticism. As Gelman et al say earlier in their book:</p>



<blockquote><p>Rather than argue the foundations of statistics—see the bibliographic note at the end of this chapter for references to foundational debates—we prefer to concentrate on the pragmatic advantages of the Bayesian framework, whose flexibility and generality allow it to cope with complex problems.</p></blockquote>



<p>If part of the appeal of Bayesian inference is that it answers the question we really want (i.e. conditional on what we've seen, what do we know / believe about the parameter(s)), it seems to me that the interpretation or definition of prior/posterior probabilities should be relatively straightforward and clear to us. But for me at least, it isn't. I am quite confident (whatever I mean by that!) that this reflects my ignorance on the topic. Part of my motivation for writing this post is the hope that people will help me understand better how to unambiguously define what is meant by a Bayesian prior/posterior probability. Please write a comment if you can help in this regard.</p>



<p>The above does not mean I don't like Bayesian methods. Indeed much of the last 10 years I have been working with and using methods like multiple imputation for missing data whose development take place in the Bayesian paradigm. For me this is fine because I know that methods like multiple imputation have good frequentist properties, and while there are definitely interpretational issues with things confidence intervals, I at least think I understand what they claim to do/be.</p>



<h2>22nd November 2022 postscript</h2>



<p>This evening there was further discussion of this topic on Twitter. As part of this Frank Harrell offered an interpretation for the Bayesian credible interval as follows:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Under data model F and prior P, [0.72, 0.91] is the shortest interval such that the probability the unknown OR generating our data is in that interval is 0.95 (highest posterior density interval).</p>— Frank Harrell (@f2harrell) <a href="https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1330633833713111040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I followed up with him as to the nature of the probability being referred to here, since it is clear that the probability notion being invoked is broader or distinct than the relative frequency notion of probability. Frank helpfully pointed me in the direction of the entry for 'probability' in his course glossary of terms, which can be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf" target="_blank">accessed here</a>. Part of this entry says:</p>



<blockquote><p>The&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;attached to the metric known as a probability is up to the user; it can represent long-run relative frequency of repeatable observations, a degree of belief, or a measure of veracity or plausibility.</p><cite>https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf</cite></blockquote>



<p>and</p>



<blockquote><p>There are other schools of probability that do not require the notion of replication at all. For example, the school of&nbsp;subjective&nbsp;probability (associated with the&nbsp;Bayesian&nbsp;school) “considers probability as a measure of the degree of belief of a given subject in the occurrence of an event or, more generally, in the veracity of a given assertion” (see P. 55 of5). de Finetti defined subjective probability in terms of wagers and odds in betting. A risk-neutral individual would be willing to wager $P&nbsp;that an event will occur when the payoff is $1 and her subjective probability is&nbsp;P&nbsp;for the event.</p><cite>https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf</cite></blockquote>



<p>As I wrote in the original post, I do not know the extensive literature on this topic well at all. But what Frank has summarised here is really useful in aiding my understanding of what the interpretation should be of the 95% probability statement attached to a 95% credible interval. It seems to me the notion of probability being invoked when interpreting a 95% credible interval has to be the subjective probability / degree of belief one described in the previous quote. Whether this definition/interpretation meets the criterion of being 'exact', as required by Frank in his tweet at the top of this post when asking for the exact interpretation of a particular realised frequentist confidence interval, I leave readers to decide.</p>

<p>Presenting ourselves to the world comes with inherent risk. With every piece of ourselves we share online, we risk compromising our personal privacy and security. We show our faces, share our feelings, and sometimes engage in difficult discussions. The beauty of social media is that the global community can, for the first time in history, engage in the same discussion all at once. The new connections we make and old ones we maintain through social media more often than not outweigh the risk.</p>
<p>Yet, scrutiny and periodic reevaluation of the platforms we use to share our lives is vital to maintaining an open and trusted medium of communication. If the last decade has taught us anything, it’s that social media platforms of yore are no longer providing a beneficial service that outweighs the immense damage they’ve caused to our privacy.</p>

<p>The primary cause of the harm associated with social media is related to the centralized nature of current platforms. When a platform is centralized, it means all the content on said platform is controlled by a single party. Users of a centralized platform are subject to the actions taken by the single party controlling the platform. These centralized social media platforms generate revenue through the exploitative collection and sale of user data.</p>
<p>With a revenue model dependent on the sale of ads, centralized platforms are incentivized to maximize the value of the data sold by manipulating and censoring user content.</p>
<p>To illustrate the downsides of centralized social media platforms, I will focus on three of the biggest: Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>
<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>Data collection is the engine that drives the revenue train for centralized platforms. Every user interaction is recorded and sold to target ads at very distinct groups of people.</p>
<p>Facebook’s privacy record leaves much to be desired. In my opinion, Facebook is no longer a social media platform and instead has become an efficient data mining operation. Facebook’s collection activities occur both inside and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/28/off-facebook-activity-page/">outside the application </a>itself. As recently as July 10th of this year, apps with Facebook integration through Facebook’s software development kit, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319784/ios-apps-crashing-spotify-tiktok-pinterest-tinder-facebook-sdk-certification-issue">SDK</a>, were shut down due to bugs within the development kit.</p>
<p>Facebook’s SDK is a part of their data mining operations. Every time an app integrates Facebook’s SDK, it pings Facebook’s servers any time a user logs into that application through their <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/03/27/zoom-ios-update-removes-feature-that-sent-user-data-to-facebook">Facebook account</a>. Through this SDK, Facebook collects user data from apps with said SDK integration.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464.jpg 1280w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>With their major acquisitions of Instagram, WhatsApp, and more recently Giphy, Facebook’s native data collection net is wider than ever. The intrusive collection of user data has reached a point of negative return versus the social interactions made through their services. Facebook data collection policy is by no means unique. However, it presents the most poignant example of the lengths to which centralized social media platforms will go to harvest as much data as possible.</p>
<h3>Revenue Model</h3>
<p>The principal purpose centralized platforms like Facebook and Twitter collect user information is to sell that information to advertisers. Revenue generated by these sites is directly proportional to the correlation between data harvested and user engagement. The detrimental effects of a social media platform with an engagement driven revenue model can be seen clearly on Twitter and Facebook through the ads and content promoted by the platform, often through the use of algorithms. Twitter’s engagement algorithm has been accused of spurring <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/22/tech/twitter-algorithm-political-rhetoric/index.html">extreme political rhetoric</a> as recently as 2019.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335.jpg 1280w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The most concerning aspect of Twitter’s algorithm is how easily it can be manipulated by bots. Bots are computer-run accounts that automatically generate content through links and standard phrases on Twitter. With a deluge of content generated by these bots, Twitter’s algorithm is often manipulated to promote content often categorized as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldurkheimer/2018/04/16/on-the-internet-bots-have-already-overrun-humans-what-do-they-want/#1e48831776f8">propaganda and fake news</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, for all of Twitter’s shortcomings, Facebook retains the title of most reckless, through its egregious, and often times dangerous, algorithmic content manipulation. Facebook’s algorithm has promoted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/opinion/facebook-cancer-ads.html?searchResultPosition=9">fake treatments </a>to cancer patients, has been accused of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/03/facebook-ad-algorithm-race-gender/">discriminatory</a> ad delivery practices, and stoking <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-political-ad-system-designed-polarize/">political partisanship</a>. I’m sure almost everyone has a story about a creepily specific ad showing up on their timeline. Creepy is precisely what Facebook’s proprietary, and therefore secret, algorithm is.</p>
<h3>Censorship</h3>
<p>Censorship across centralized social media platforms is rampant and affects all ideologies across every platform. To discuss censorship I will focus primarily on YouTube and how its approach exemplifies the problematic nature of centralized platform content moderation. Since its acquisition by Google in 2006, YouTube has become one of the most visited sites on the internet. This centralized platform houses mainstream and niche content, with one set of rules governing it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>All centralized social media platforms have a fundamental problem with content moderation. Effective content moderation requires a “scalpel”, not a “hammer”. With large centralized platforms like YouTube, there is no way to perform nuanced moderation. As a result, YouTube uses the hammer approach through automated content moderation tools. What results from the hammer approach to content moderation is the censorship of certain groups on the platform who follow the rules set forth by YouTube themselves. For example, LGBTQ YouTube creators’ videos were flagged and demonetized by <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/10/20893258/youtube-lgbtq-censorship-demonetization-nerd-city-algorithm-report">YouTube’s algorithm</a> because of the algorithm’s inability to distinguish non-sexual queer content from sexually explicit “mature” content. Where large centralized social media platforms are fighting against misinformation on their platforms, a “hammer” approach to censorship is both ineffective and potentially dangerous.</p>
<h3>Decentralized Social Media</h3>
<p>The issues of data collection, revenue models, and censorship in social media are related to the centralized nature of these platforms. Fortunately, decentralized and open source alternatives are available. Three examples of decentralized social media platforms are <strong>Mastodon</strong>, <strong>Pixelfed</strong>, and <strong>Peertube</strong>.</p>
<p>Decentralized social media platforms operate differently from centralized platforms. For example, if you wanted to communicate with anyone on Facebook, you must have an account on the Facebook server (i.e. have a Facebook account). However, with a decentralized platform like Mastodon, there is no central “Mastodon server” like Facebook. There are multiple servers (called <em>instances</em>) all running Mastodon separately. Now, if you wanted to communicate with someone on Mastodon, you just need an account on any instance running Mastodon. Anyone can run an instance and each instance is then administrated and moderated by whoever hosts the instance. This instanced approach allows for the “scalpel” approach to content moderation that centralized platforms are incapable of implementing. With volunteer moderators managing the content on specific instances, and migration from one instance to another made easy, users can find or even create an instance that caters to the specific moderation practices they desire.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub.png" alt="" width="474" height="291" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub.png 1012w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub-300x184.png 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub-768x471.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></p>
<p>Instances “speak” to each other through protocols like <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>. Through ActivityPub, users on one instance can talk to users on another instance, creating a social media network that is both open and closed. Posts from users on other instances are visible on ones feed, but those posts can be separated from posts from users on their local instance.</p>
<p>Mastodon, Pixelfed, and Peertube are open source, meaning anyone can examine the code and run an instance themselves. With no centralization, there is no dragnet collection and sale of user data. Instances may have a Patreon or other monetary support system in place to help finance the upkeep of an instance.</p>
<p>Decentralized social media is supported by the community, for the community, and as such there are no ads or algorithms. Social Media feeds are in chronological order, and “likes” and “favorites” are not recorded and used to push intensely personal ads. Building communities and sharing our lives on these decentralized social media platforms brings the value of connection through online platforms back to reasonable and appropriate levels.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, the biggest player in the centralized social media space is also the most exploitative. I strongly believe deleting ones Facebook account is the biggest and most effective step one can take in reclaiming their privacy. Untangling oneself from Facebook’s many arms is difficult, but starting with the base app is the best place to start. Mastodon and Pixelfed provide great platforms to begin building an online community anew, one friend at a time.</p>

November 21, 2020 | https://secbytes.net/implant-roulette-part-1:-nimplant/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://secbytes.net/implant-roulette-part-1:-nimplant/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>When creating an implant what language first comes to mind? Of course, the answer is it depends;
however, typically it is one of the following languages: C, C++, C#, Rust, Go, maybe even Python.
While those languages are all dandy, they are not the only programming languages that exist.
Throughout this series, I will be exploring different languages and seeing what
they bring to the table for implant &amp; offensive tool development.
The first language that will be examined is <a href="https://nim-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nim</a>.</p><h3 id="what-is-nim">What is Nim</h3><p>If we visit <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nim’s Github page</a> there is a concise definition of what Nim is,
“Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula.”
Some of the “big” benefits of Nim are:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>* Cross-Platform: Generated executables support Windows, Linux, BSD, and macOS.</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>* Nim can compile to C, C++, Objective-C, and JavaScript.</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>* Nim binaries are small and the compiler toolchain allows for a lot of optimizations</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>* Nim can interface with other languages through Nim's foreign function interface (FFI) [1]</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>* Nim syntax is very quick to pick up and is reminiscent of Python.</span></p></pre></div><p>[1]<!-- -->: <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/backends.html#interfacing-nim-code-calling-the-backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://nim-lang.org/docs/backends.html#interfacing-nim-code-calling-the-backend</a></p><p>Of course, these aren’t the only benefits of the language, more will reveal themself as time goes on.</p><h3 id="a-simple-injector">A Simple Injector</h3><p>Let’s get hands-on with Nim and see how to develop a simple injector.
Below is an implementation of a typical CreateRemoteThread injector:
Instead of having to manually interop with the Windows API via the FFI there
are <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nimble</a> packages that contain some Windows API
definitions. The one I tend to use is <a href="https://github.com/khchen/winim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Winim</a>.
Winim can also <a href="https://khchen.github.io/winim/com.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">interop with COM</a>.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/c9d6d68b96f6495705555553bc886dba/fa827/crt_injector.png" alt="crt_injector"></p>
      
    <p>Let’s compile, run the program:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --run crtinjection.nim</span></p></pre></div><p>and make sure everything works. By default when you compile Nim code it generates
C code. In the latter section “Integrating into Existing Tooling” verification shall
ensue.</p><p>As an aside, if you do not want to use 3rd party packages that is fine if you examine
what Winim does under the hood for example when <a href="https://github.com/khchen/winim/blob/d300192c588f73dddef26e3c317f148aa23465c3/winim/inc/winbase.nim#L1942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">calling CreateRemoteThread</a>.
It is simply importing the function for us as denoted by the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#foreign-function-interface-importc-pragma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">importc pragma</a>
as that allows us to import a proc or a variable from C. Also, available for importing
from foreign languages are: <code>.importcpp</code>, <code>.importobjc</code>, and <code>importjs</code>.</p><p>CreateRemoteThread proc:</p><p><code>proc CreateRemoteThread*(hProcess: HANDLE, lpThreadAttributes: LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES, dwStackSize: SIZE_T, lpStartAddress: LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE, lpParameter: LPVOID, dwCreationFlags: DWORD, lpThreadId: LPDWORD): HANDLE {.winapi, stdcall, dynlib: "kernel32", importc.}</code></p><h3 id="peeking-under-the-hood">Peeking Under the Hood</h3><p>What is going on under the hood is quite interesting. If we inspect the executable’s IAT we see
there are no static imports for OpenProcess, VirualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, and CreateRemoteThread.
That is because Nim is dynamically loading the required libraries with LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress.
Furthermore, when compiled Nim will place the source code of the language you are targeting in a folder
called nimcache. You can also specify the nimcache path for generated files with the compiler flag
<code>--nimcache:PATH</code>.</p><p>Below is a snippet of generated code for inject.nim
To make this easier to read I have compiled the program with an additional flag <code>--embedsrc:on</code> this flag tells the Nim compiler
to embed the source code as comments in the generated output. For compilation:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --run --hints:on --d:release --embedsrc:on inject.nim</span></p></pre></div><p>A snippet of generated C source code that performs injection:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/f871bb711a469344dbd19d321401823a/9a8de/snippet_inject.png" alt="Inject_Snippet"></p>
      
    <p>Here we can inspect what our function calls are doing under the hood, the
Windows API calls done by winim rely on the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/dynlib.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dynlib module</a> to dynamically
invoke calls. If we inspect that source code we can see
the LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress combination.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/8c2d1836e5e394c3d66dd878af26a70f/e3d9b/dynlib_code.png" alt="dynlib_code"></p>
      
    <h3 id="nim-and-donut">Nim and Donut</h3><p>Coming from C# one of my favorite tools for crafting payloads is <a href="https://github.com/theWover/Donut" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Donut</a>.
One of the great features with Donut is that it not only works with .NET assemblies but also with native DLLs
and executables. Since Nim can generate both C and C++ source code and link it to a native executable or DLL
Donut is an amazing utility that can transform our output to shellcode.
Since shellcode is language-agnostic we can easily integrate it into other tooling.</p><h3 id="integrating-into-existing-tooling">Integrating into Existing Tooling</h3><p>With shellcode you can easily integrate it into your own custom injectors in the language of your choice.
Of course since these are native executables and DLL’s we can also perform manually mapping and load them into memory.
Coming from C# my goto tools to perform the manual mapping are <a href="https://github.com/Dewera/Lunar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lunar</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/cobbr/SharpSploit/tree/master/SharpSploit/Execution/DynamicInvoke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">D/Invoke tooling in SharpSploit</a>.</p><p>Let’s compile the injector code as a DLL and export an inject function.
To export the function we need to tell Nim to export it by adding the
following pragmas: <code>exportc, dynlib, and cdecl. or stdcall.</code>
The resulting inject proc is as follows:
<code>proc inject(pid: int): bool {.stdcall, exportc, dynlib.} = </code> <br>
Let’s compile the DLL as follows:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --d:release --app:lib --opt:size --inject.nim</span></p></pre></div><p>With the DLL let’s manually map it using SharpSploit’s D/Invoke tooling.
If you specifically just want the D/Invoke part you can also use the <a href="https://github.com/TheWover/DInvoke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">repository</a>
or <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/DInvoke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nuget package</a> for solely D/Invoke.</p><p>Manual Map Code:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/f19f9f651aaf612e5aedd6cb03cebbdd/77a0f/dinvoke_nimmanualmapcode.png" alt="dinvokemanmapcode"></p>
      
    <p>Let’s run it and make sure our crt injector proc is executed properly.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/66af0e3621b0f60c4d539a0403723250/ff8d2/manmapdemo.png" alt="manmepdemo"></p>
      
    <h3 id="embedding-nimscript-with-nimscripter">Embedding NimScript with Nimscripter</h3><p>Within Nim, there is an evolving scripting language known as NimScript.
In the NimScript <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/nims.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a> it is defined as,
“the subset of Nim that can be evaluated by Nim’s built-in virtual machine (VM).”
NimScript is typically used as a configuration language in a devops role for example to run tests and build projects.
However, one of the biggest caveats with NimScript as stated within the documentation,
Nim’s <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/backends.html#interfacing-nim-code-calling-the-backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FFI (foreign function interface)</a> is not available in NimScript.
This means that any stdlib module which relies on importc cannot be used in the VM.”
Nim’s FFI is how Nim can call other functions written in other programming languages, which is basically
Nim’s cross-platform version <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">P/Invoke</a>.
A possible solution is to write the FFI functionality in Nim and expose to NimScript.</p><p>Does that mean NimScript is not viable? Absolutely not,
especially with the slow shift in which especially for implant development
it’s not always ideal to statically embed everything. Instead leaning towards a lightweight
implant that can dynamically resolve commands within memory so even if an analyst
obtains the binary, not everything is revealed.</p><p>There are already a couple open source projects: (<a href="https://github.com/komerdoor/nim-embedded-nimscript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/komerdoor/nim-embedded-nimscript</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/Serenitor/embeddedNimscript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/Serenitor/embeddedNimscript</a>) that show how to use
NimScript as an embedded scripting language.</p><p>However, those repositories while noble do not easily allow the user to expose Nim code to NimScript and
is are simplistic.
Luckily, a new repository known as <a href="https://github.com/beef331/nimscripter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nimscripter</a> allows for easy interoperability between Nim and NimScript.</p><p>Below is an example in which the FFI specific code to call <code>MessageBoxA</code> is exposed to NimScript allowing
us to pass in a string of NimScript to invoke the Nim proc.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/a0329212717d301eda283a791eda6fc5/fa827/nimscript_embeddedmessage.png" alt="nimscript_embeddedmessage"></p>
      
    <p>In a nutshell, what is happening under the hood is the
<a href="https://github.com/beef331/nimscripter/blob/master/src/nimscripter.nim#L140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">script is loaded</a> and the main body is evaluated which allows us to access symbols it exposes.
A small caveat is that you need to include Nim’s stdlib as an external folder; luckily, depending on what modules
you are you using from stdlib you may be able to remove some if unused.
If you would like to read more about embedding NimScript as well as just learn more about NimScript, I encourage you to check out this wonderful series:
<a href="https://peterme.net/using-nimscript-as-a-configuration-language-embedding-nimscript-pt-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://peterme.net/using-nimscript-as-a-configuration-language-embedding-nimscript-pt-1.html</a>.</p><h3 id="putting-the-pieces-together">Putting the Pieces Together</h3><p>While a simple injector is cool let’s see how hard it is to develop an implant
in Nim. Luckily, just within Nim’s cross-platform <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/lib.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">stdlib</a> is everything needed to create a basic implant
from the FFI for API calls, httpclient for http requests, and stellar json support as a medium for data. The C2 I chose to develop the implant for is <a href="https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mythic</a>, Mythic
is very sophisticated and well structured. Furthermore, implants are essentially plug and play as everything is
dockerized and your agent just needs to communicate back and forth via certain rest api endpoints.</p><p>Sprouting a few weeks later <a href="https://github.com/MythicAgents/Nimplant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nimplant</a> is born.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/3125a933e063ab22da800b151f09b486/a048d/nimplant_logo.png" alt="nimplant_logo"></p>
      
    <p>Nimplant is a cross-platform Linux and Windows implant for Mythic C2 that is fully asynchronous
with the agent able to generate both C and C++ source code. Currently it just has basic functionality; however, it will be updated
overtime and become much more sophisticated. If you would like to read more about Nimplant
feel free to read the <a href="https://github.com/MythicAgents/Nimplant/tree/master/documentation-payload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">project’s documentation</a>.</p><p>Example Nimplant checkin:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/5ae0ab5e6ae6720c5cd26a95d1d8122b/a6ea6/nimplant_demo.png" alt="nimplant_demo"></p>
      
    <h3 id="obfuscation">Obfuscation</h3><p>With Nim, there are ample opportunities throughout the development cycle to introduce obfuscation.
Three key areas that I will highlight are:</p><p><strong>Note: Of course these aren’t the only forms of obfuscation you can do just a small subset.</strong></p><p><h4>1. Code Obfuscation</h4></p><p>With Nim opportunities for code obfuscation are ripe, two quick and easy nimble packages
you can utilize are: <a href="https://github.com/Yardanico/nim-strenc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nim-strenc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Yardanico/nuglifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nuglifier</a>.
Let’s just apply nim-strenc to the string literal and view the resulting C file in
our Nimcache.</p><p>Before:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/6b91405cb049764789b3dcaa914603d8/e4370/hello_world_basic.png" alt="beforenimhello"></p>
      
    <p>After:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/c282e87fe02cf7ca70c23d2ec7127c68/e4370/strenc_hello_world.png" alt="afternimhellostrenc"></p>
      
    <p>When compiling the creator of strenc recommends turning hints off and stripping the binary so we shall do that.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --run --hints:off --d:release --passL:-s</span></p></pre></div><p><code>--passL</code> will pass an option to the linker and we are passing <code>-s</code> to the GCC linker to perform stripping.
Within the Nimcache folder, go to hello_r and view the file <code>@mhello.nim.c</code>.
Inside that file we can see both string literals after they have been xor encrypted:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>STRING_LITERAL</span><span>(</span><span>TM__xLHv575t3PG1lB5wK05Xqg_3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"\207\251\241\236\234\320\246\231\205\230\221\333"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>12</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>STRING_LITERAL</span><span>(</span><span>TM__xLHv575t3PG1lB5wK05Xqg_4</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"\360\275\246"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>With nim-strenc if you look at the codebase it’s less than 30 lines.

Doing this is tricky in a React app that uses server side rendering (SSR) because client and server rendering work quite differently: Client render is async so data can be loaded inside components when they render, but server render is completely synchronous - the data must be loaded before render happens.</p><p data-reactid="57">Data loading is, of course, async. The client component-centric data loading pattern is nice, but it's incompatible with synchronous server render. React simply has no mechanism to wait for data to load when components render on SSR. There's a further problem too: React also provides no built-in way to hydrate data loaded during SSR into client state on first render. This is also up to you to implement.</p><p data-reactid="58">So, full stack data loading in React is a tricky problem. A couple of solutions have emerged:</p><ol data-reactid="59"><li data-reactid="60"><p data-reactid="61">Load data at the route level, instead of the component level, then pass data to all components under the route. Works on SSR since the route is known in the request, so data can be loaded before render begins. Can be implemented by piecing together router and state manager libraries.</p></li><li data-reactid="62"><p data-reactid="63">Use a framework that wraps React and abstracts the problem away, perhaps by providing a framework-specific async data loading function for components that works on SSR, and also takes care of hydrating state on the client.</p></li></ol><p data-reactid="64">React Frontload aims to provide a third way - the component-centric data loading pattern available full stack, but without having to buy into a whole framework just to get this feature. It's just a small library that solves this one problem, and can be used in any React stack.</p><p data-reactid="68">Here's an example of loading data into a component with React Frontload</p><p><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>TorchScript is one of the most important parts of the Pytorch ecosystem, allowing portable, efficient and nearly seamless deployment. With just a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code and some simple model changes you can export an asset that runs anywhere <code>libtorch</code> does. It’s an important toolset to master if you want to run your models outside the lab at high efficiency.</p>
<p>Good <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html">introductory material</a> is already available for starting to work with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html">TorchScript</a> including <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html">execution in the C++ <code>libtorch</code> runtime</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_language_reference.html">reference material</a> is also provided. This article is a collection of topics going beyond the basics of your first export.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-vs-scripting">
  Tracing vs Scripting
  <a href="#tracing-vs-scripting">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Pytorch provides two methods for generating TorchScript from your model code — tracing and scripting — but which should you use? Let’s recap how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html"><strong>Tracing.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> you’ll provide your model and sample input as arguments. The input will be fed through the model as in regular inference and the executed operations will be traced and recorded into TorchScript. Logical structure will be frozen into the path taken during this sample execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.script.html"><strong>Scripting.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.script</code> you’ll simply provide your model as an argument. TorchScript will be generated from the static inspection of the <code>nn.Module</code> contents (recursively).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not obvious from the tutorial documentation, but choosing which method to use is a fairly simple and fluid choice:</p>
<h3 id="use-scripting-by-default">
  Use Scripting by Default
  <a href="#use-scripting-by-default">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Because <code>torch.jit.script</code> captures both the operations and full conditional logic of your model, it’s a great place to start. If your model doesn’t need any <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_unsupported.html">unsupported Pytorch functionality</a> and has logic restricted to the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_builtin_functions.html#python-built-in-functions">supported subset of Python functions</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_python_reference.html">syntax</a>, then <code>torch.jit.script</code> should be all you need.</p>
<p>One major advantage of scripting over tracing is that an export is likely to either fail for a well-defined reason — implying a clear code modification — or succeed without warnings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Unlike Python, TorchScript is Statically Typed</strong></p>
<p>You will need to be consistent about container element datatypes, and be wary of implicit function signatures. A useful practice is to use type hints in method signatures.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite TorchScript’s ability to capture conditional logic it does not allow you to run arbitrary Python within <code>libtorch</code> — a popular misconception.</p>
<h3 id="use-tracing-if-you-must">
  Use Tracing if You Must
  <a href="#use-tracing-if-you-must">#</a>
</h3>
<p>There are a few special cases in which <code>torch.jit.trace</code> may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to modify the model code — because you do not have access or ownership — you may find scripting the model simply will not work because it uses unsupported Pytorch/Python functionality.</li>
<li>In pursuit of performance or to bake in architectural decisions the logic freezing behavior of tracing might be preferable — similar to inlining C/C++ code.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pay Close Attention to Tracer Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Due to how tracing can simplify model behavior, each warning should be fully understood and only then ignored (or fixed). Also, be sure to trace in eval mode if you are exporting a model for production inference!</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="use-both-together">
  Use Both Together
  <a href="#use-both-together">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Scripted and traced code can be freely mixed, and this is often a great choice. See the existing <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch.org</a> documentation for <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#mixing-tracing-and-scripting">details</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html#mixing-scripting-and-tracing">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 id="device-pinning">
  Device Pinning
  <a href="#device-pinning">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you find yourself using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> on some code, you’ll have to actively deal with some of the gotchas or face performance and portability consequences. Besides addressing any warnings Pytorch emits, you’ll also need to keep an eye out for device pinning. Just like <code>torch.jit.trace</code> records and freezes conditional logic, it will also trace and make constant the values resulting from this logic — this can include device constants.</p>
<p>Using this sample code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we trace while executing on CPU or GPU we get this TorchScript (scroll to the right on mobile):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>
  <span>_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>ops</span><span>.</span><span>prim</span><span>.</span><span>NumToTensor</span><span>(</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
  <span>_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>_0</span><span>),</span> <span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>(</span><span>"cpu"</span><span>),</span> <span>pin_memory</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can see that <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> has been inserted as a constant into the generated TorchScript. If we try to get clever with this code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Tracing will now result in TorchScript that is pinned to the tracing device. When traced on GPU, we see this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span>
    <span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>
  <span>_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>ops</span><span>.</span><span>prim</span><span>.</span><span>NumToTensor</span><span>(</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
  <span>_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>_0</span><span>),</span> <span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>(</span><span>"cuda:0"</span><span>),</span> <span>pin_memory</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tensors Created During Tracing Will Have Their Device Pinned</strong></p>
<p>This can be a significant performance and portability problem.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="performance-and-portability">
  Performance and Portability
  <a href="#performance-and-portability">#</a>
</h3>
<p>If we later deserialize and run this TorchScript in <code>libtorch</code> the <code>arange</code> tensor will always be created on the device that is pinned — <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> or <code>torch.device("cuda:0")</code> in the examples above. If the rest of the model is running on a different device this can result in costly memory transfers and synchronization.</p>
<p>This device pinning issue extends to multi-GPU scenarios as well. If you have traced and exported a model on <code>cuda:0</code> and then run it on <code>cuda:1</code> you’ll see transfers and synchronization between the devices. Not good. Perhaps even worse, if such a model is run in an environment without any CUDA-capable device it will fail since <code>cuda:0</code> doesn’t exist.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Replace Tensors Created During Execution With Parameters</strong></p>
<p>Tensors created in the execution path while tracing will have their device pinned. Depending on model logic, these can often be turned into Parameters created during construction.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An example of the problem looks like this in Nsight Systems:</p>

<p>The same pattern holds for <code>tensor[indexes]</code> and <code>tensor.index_select(0, indexes)</code>. This device pinning carries the same performance and portability risks as noted above.</p>

<h2 id="direct-graph-modification">
  Direct Graph Modification
  <a href="#direct-graph-modification">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Once we’ve used <code>torch.jit.script</code> or <code>torch.jit.trace</code> to generate a ScriptModule or ScriptFunction we can use <code>.graph</code>, <code>.inlined_graph</code> or <code>.code</code> to understand exactly what TorchScript has been generated. Though it has an entirely undocumented interface it is possible (and fun) to access and modify the generated TorchScript AST directly via the <code>.graph</code> method.</p>
<p>The most useful parts of the API are defined in <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp">torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp</a>. As you can see, all the basic functionality is present for finding and changing the graph nodes you want. If you change nodes or arguments and then persist the module your subsequent TorchScript load and inference will reflect your changes, though modules cannot be changed recursively in this way (<code>torch.jit.freeze</code> can be useful here).</p>
<p>An example of the kind of graph modification that is possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>undevice</span><span>(</span><span>tsc</span><span>):</span>
    <span># use ::to variant which does not hardcode device</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>to_node</span> <span>in</span> <span>tsc</span><span>.</span><span>graph</span><span>.</span><span>findAllNodes</span><span>(</span><span>'aten::to'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>,</span> <span>pin_mem</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>inputs</span><span>())</span>
        <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>removeAllInputs</span><span>()</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span><span>]:</span>
            <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>addInput</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>constant</span> <span>in</span> <span>tsc</span><span>.</span><span>graph</span><span>.</span><span>findAllNodes</span><span>(</span><span>'prim::Constant'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>hasUses</span><span>():</span>
            <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>destroy</span><span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above code will modify a traced graph, changing <code>aten::to</code> to use an overload which doesn’t change memory location.</p>
<p>But what is this really useful for? As an undocumented API you’d be unwise to use this capability in a production pipeline unless you like maintenance coding. I would only recommend it for research, as in the above example which I used to understand and profile the transfer/synchronization behavior of tensor subscripting.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don’t Bother With Direct Graph Modification</strong></p>
<p>For legitimate production use-cases you can almost always find a way to modify your model code to generate the TorchScript you want.</p>

<p>You can get some <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/#stage-3-hacked-deepstream-mdash-80-tensorrt-20-torchscript">awesome results with TensorRT</a> but exporting a model from Pytorch to TensorRT is far from a sure thing. The export path to ONNX and then to TensorRT can fail due to missing or incompatible operations at either step and this can be frustrating.</p>
<p>After the obligatory Google search, I’ve found a reasonable hail-mary approach is to rewrite your tensor processing code to avoid unsupported operators. I can’t give general advice for this but let me show you an example of how this can be possible: <code>repeat_interleave</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>RI</span><span>(</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>nn</span><span>.</span><span>Module</span><span>):</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>X</span><span>.</span><span>repeat_interleave</span><span>(</span><span>repeat</span><span>,</span> <span>dim</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

<p>Doesn’t work:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">RuntimeError: Exporting the operator repeat_interleave to ONNX opset version <span>11</span> is not supported. Please open a bug to request ONNX <span>export</span> support <span>for</span> the missing operator.</code></pre></div>
<p>However, the behavior of <code>repeat_interleave</code> with a fixed <code>dim</code> argument can be replicated in a form that will export to ONNX …</p></article></div>

<p>The Last Super is<strong> brand new Super Nintendo (SNES) game</strong> created to celebrate the 30th birthday of the console!</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ1NzUyMDUuZ2lm/original/sd47O2.gif"><br></p>
<p>As the last SNES cartridge on Earth, you'll have to move and jump around in each of the 20 levels of the game so every SNES can play you! But don't let a SNES without cartridge for too long...</p>
<h2>SNES ROM or cartridge?</h2>
<p>The Last Super is an actual game for the Super Nintendo / SNES / Super Famicom console. If you want to play it on a real console, you can <a href="https://catskullelectronics.com/collections/games/products/the-last-super" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">buy a beautiful game cartridge</a> from Catskull Games. As an extra bonus, this cartridge also contains my previous SNES game <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/keeping-snes-alive" target="_blank">Keeping SNES Alive!</a><br></p>

<p>The cartridge is made from newly built elements<em> (PCB, shells, etc)</em> all designed and hand assembled in the US by Catskull himself. The cartridge is region-free. It has been tested and working on NTSC SNES, PAL SNES, JP SFC, and Analogue Super Nt.</p>
<p>If your prefer to play it on emulator, you can <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/the-last-super/purchase" target="_blank">download a ROM version of the game here</a>, and use it with any SNES emulator you like. Here are a few examples: </p>

<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ1ODEyMzIuanBn/original/sTHVSK.jpg"><br></p>
<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>The game was <strong>programmed in C</strong> using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PVSNESlib</a> by Alekmaul.</p>
<p>The <strong>music was composed by </strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/xracecar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>XRACECAR</strong></a>. The two tracks are:</p>
<ul><li><em>"ayyy you know the man"</em> (under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA license)<br><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/ayyy+you+know+the+man.xm/23747/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/ayyy+you+know+the+man.xm/23747/</a> <em><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a></em></li><li><em><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"></a>"7049 Bytes of Memories"</em> (under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA license)<br><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/</a></li></ul>
<p><strong>A fun fact about the audio</strong>: the <em>"shlack</em>" sound that you hear when the cartridge enters a console is an<strong> actual recording of the noise made by my SNES power button</strong> <em>(recorded directly from my childhood console, still alive and kicking after 30 years!)</em></p>
<p>Last but not the least, <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/the-last-super/purchase" target="_blank">the full source code is included</a>.<strong> I spent a lot of time cleaning up and commenting the code as thoroughly as I could</strong>, hoping it'll help and motivate you to start making new SNES games too!<br></p></div></div>]]>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Systemd targets are a special kind of unit, this is how I used
them to serialize the boot order of my server and how I am planning
on using them to shape the supervision tree of my system.</p>

<p>As a Linux user I have systemd installed on my devices but I usually tweak
somebody else unit or write a service unit to start a program at boot.</p>

<p>This has changed some time ago when I started looking more into other
unit types that are available for use.</p>

<p>I started with <em>timers</em> to automate recurring tasks such as renewing
certificates using certbot but there is little information about how to
use the rest of the unit types.</p>

<p>For this time we are going to look at a target unit because I see it
as the most useful to get out and I happened to be working on mine recently.</p>

<h3 id="targets">targets</h3>

<p>As I run more and more services on my server I find that there is
more need to divide them into layers looking at their common dependencies and
what they provide; some of them are there to provide an internal service and others
are there for displaying HTML to me.
E.g. most of my web services use the same postgresql cluster and they should all
be started when this becomes available.</p>

<p>Basically for this instance we are going to divide programs I run into two
categories, infrastructure and front-facing. For both groups we will make
a target unit to group them and impose a start order.</p>

<p>For this experiment we will make two targets, <strong>infra.target</strong> and <strong>front.target</strong>,
group the services to be started by their target and add everything to the
supervision tree.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span># infra.target
</span><span>[Unit]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span><span>infrastructure target</span>
<span># a lists of units that will be started along this one
</span><span>Wants</span><span>=</span><span>postgresql.service nginx.service</span>
<span>Wants</span><span>=</span><span>multi-user.target</span>

<span># front.target
</span><span>[Unit]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span><span>front-end target</span>
<span>After</span><span>=</span><span>infra.target</span>
<span>Wants</span><span>=</span><span>infra.target web-app.service</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now for a brief explanation, when starting <strong>infra.target</strong> we are also starting
the units <strong>postgresql.service</strong> and <strong>nginx.service</strong> as they are listed as <em>Wants</em>
and the same is true for starting <strong>front-end.target</strong> starting <strong>infra.target</strong> and
<strong>web-app.service</strong>.</p>

<p>With out dependencies out of the way we also have to ensure order of execution, starting
a web app before the database server is started is not what we want.</p>

<p>What we have to understand here is that we have expressed dependency but not ordering; to
express ordering of units startup we have to use the <em>After</em>, <em>Before</em> directives.</p>

<p>So going back to the previous example we want <strong>front.target</strong> to be started after <strong>infra.target</strong>
and all its dependencies have completed the start up sequence as this means that both
<strong>postgresql.service</strong> and <strong>nginx.service</strong> have been started.</p>

<p>We have taken our initial problem, ensuring some infrastructure will be started, and put a
time constraint on when our front end is started. But we are not done yet!</p>

<p>The startup sequence differs from unit type to unit type; e.g. a service unit has finished the
startup sequence when all <em>ExecStart*</em> directives have been issued, what about a target unit<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>?</p>

<p>This could become an issue with a long startup time, e.g. connection to a another machine to register
you have booted, but for things such as starting nginx or a small postgresql cluster things should be
fast enough.</p>



<p>The last step to take is to notice that we have a chain linking our
targets <strong>front-end.target</strong> -&gt; <strong>infra.target</strong> -&gt; <strong>multi-user.target</strong>
and we can then change the default target from <strong>default.target</strong> to
<strong>front-end.target</strong> and the boot sequence will still go through you previous setup.</p>

<p>So wrapping up we saw how you can use a target unit to wrap together part of your services and wait for
them to start all together, this will enable you to have layers of services and overall
abstract a little more over the server you are booting.</p>

<p>Both are APIs for shared-memory programming. In C, OpenMP is a relatively high-level extension, providing compiler directives for parallelizing many programs with ease while some low-level thread interactions may be difficult to program. Pthreads provide some low-level coordination constructs that are unavailable in OpenMP, making other programs easier to parallelize while requiring explicit specification of the behavior of each thread, which may virtually be any that is conceivable.</p>
<p>Pthreads programs can be used with <em>any</em> C compiler, provided the system has a Pthreads library. OpenMP requires compiler support for some operations, which <em>many</em> compilers provide.</p>
<h3 id="area-under-the-curve">Area Under the Curve</h3>
<p>The program we are about to develop is oftentimes called the 'Hello world!' of parallel programming. We will be using the following formula for <cite>arctan(1)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></cite> in approximating the value for π.</p>
<p><span><span><img src="https://hasithsen.github.io/tech/posts/parallelizing-pi-approx-openmp/Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png" alt="Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png"></span><span><span>Just as we learned a long time ago in Kindergarten, the value of the integral here is the area between the graph and the x-axis while x goes from 0 to 1.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Going through the serial version of the program in C, the value for above is calculated for each integer within range <strong>[1, N)</strong> and summed up within a loop. The resulting <strong>sum</strong> is them divided by <strong>N</strong> for getting an estimate of <strong>π / 4</strong>, before printing out the calculated <em>approximate</em> for π.</p>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="modifying-parallelized-code">Modifying Parallelized Code</h3>
<p>Before changing anything, it pays to understand whatever we want changed in the first-place. So, let us go through the above code. The function <code>omp_get_wtime()</code>, defined in <code>omp.h</code>, returns the amount of seconds since a previous <em>fixed</em> point in time (included for execution timing purposes). Setting the number of threads to spawn when running parallel code (code inside parallel scope, that is) done by <code>omp_set_num_threds</code>. Changing the <code>set</code> to <code>get</code> and calling from <em>within</em> a parallel section returns the number of threads in execution (<code>get</code> counterpart is available for most functions with <code>set</code>). However, due to resource constraints on the system, it is possible we ending up with a lower number of threads.</p>
<p>The directive <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> is for parallelizing the code–it is safe to assume if this is not present somewhere, the program will not be parallelized by OpenMP. The scope of code that needs to be executed in parallel may be defined the same way we do scoping in C, with <code>{}</code>, or without–whereas only immediately following code line will be considered in-scope. This is where new threads will be spawned and start running alongside the master thread, branching the execution.</p>
<p>Any variables created within the parallel scope are private for each thread (i.e. <code>sum_thread</code>), and will not contribute to race conditions. Therefore, the <code>for</code> loop incrementing <code>sum_thread</code> is divided among threads spawned. Please note the way threads divide the iterations among themselves can be handled up to some extent with specific directives, the default behavior is expected here by omitting them.</p>
<p>Critical sections may be scoped within <code>#pragma omp atomic</code> or <code>#pragma omp critical</code>. The former enables low level atomicity of execution (with higher performance) if available, and only accepts a single assignment statement (of an allowed form) within scope, while the latter can handle multiple statements. Both effectively serializes execution. If we end up with most of the code within the scope of either, our code is probably too poor for parallelization with OpenMP.</p>
<p>Outside the <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> scope, previously spawned threads will join the master thread, and it will continue executing similar to a serial program. It is worth mentioning that we may have as many parallel/serial sections as we please.</p>
<p>As should be apparent from above, OpenMP is designed to be easy to learn and can be used for parallelizing existing serial code with minimal modifications. What if we could further simplify the above code?</p>
<h3 id="reducing-the-parallel-code">Reducing the Parallel Code</h3>
<p>Modifying the <code>sum</code> variable at the end of the <code>for</code> loop in above code could be simplified with a reduction operation provided by OpenMP. That is, we can instruct OpenMP to synchronously add the <em>local sum</em> calculated by each thread (within loop) to the shared variable <code>sum</code> as shown in the parallel version below.</p>

<p>Here, we have a single statement <code>#pragma omp parallel for</code> that tells we want the immediately-following <code>for</code> loop parallelized, which is identical to having <code>#pragma omp for</code> immediately before a <code>for</code> loop <em>within</em> the scope of <code>#pragma omp parallel</code>. The <code>reduction(+:sum)</code> tells that we want the <code>sum</code> variable to contain the <em>sum</em> of each local sum calculated in each iteration only available locally to the thread that runs it. OpenMP does this by creating a private <em>sum</em> variable for each thread and initializing it to <strong>unit</strong> according to the operation (ex. <strong>0</strong> for <code>+</code>, <strong>1</strong> for <code>*</code>), this is how we use the <strong>reduction operator</strong> in OpenMP. The <code>shared(N)</code> tells that the <code>N</code> variable should be shared with all threads, this is fine since threads are only reading it–therefore no potential data races. Finally, the approximated values along with the time taken for calculations are printed.</p>
<p>Now that we went through the code, note that the  <code>omp_set_num_threads</code> is not mandatory when using OpenMP, the program defaults to spawning the maximum number of threads possible on the system at execution time.

		<p>The most exciting moment of the web application development is a deployment. Your app is going live! It can also be nerve-wracking moment. Unfortunately. There are many options, many variables and configurations. It is easy to miss something … In this article, I will show you how to pack Django and React application into containers and deploy them with <code>docker-compose</code>. The presented approach can be reused on any Cloud Provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, GCP, Heroku) - you just need a Virtual Private Server (VPS).</p>

<p>In this article:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will create two <code>docker-compose</code> configuration files. One for development (easier version) and one for production (with SSL certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>).</li>
  <li>The React static files will be served by <code>nginx</code>.</li>
  <li>The Django static files (from admin and DRF browsable API) will be served by <code>nginx</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>nginx</code> will be reverse-proxy to the Django server (<code>gunicorn</code>).</li>
  <li>In the production, we will add <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/"><code>certbot</code></a> to renew the certificate. To issue a certificate we will use a bash script. You need to have a domain to issue the certificate .</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be using code from the previous article: <a href="https://saasitive.com/tutorial/crud-django-rest-framework-react/">CRUD in Django Rest Framework and React</a> (code with <a href="https://github.com/saasitive/django-react-boilerplate/tree/v6">tag v6</a>).</p>

<h2 id="create-dockerfile-for-django-and-nginx">Create Dockerfile for Django and Nginx</h2>

<p>Let’s start by adding a new directory <code>docker</code> in the main directory of the project. Your project structure should look like below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── backend
├── docker
├── frontend
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the <code>docker</code> directory please add <code>backend</code> directory with two files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>docker/backend/Dockerfile</code> - it will define how to build Django container,</li>
  <li><code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> - it will be entrypoint for Django container. It will apply migrations, collect static files and run WSGI server with <a href="https://gunicorn.org/"><code>gunicorn</code></a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="django-dockerfile">Django Dockerfile</h3>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> to build Django container:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># docker/backend/Dockerfile</span>

<span>FROM</span><span> python:3.8.3-alpine</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app</span>
<span>ADD</span><span> ./backend/requirements.txt /app/backend/</span>


<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install</span> <span>--upgrade</span> pip
<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install </span>gunicorn
<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> backend/requirements.txt

<span>ADD</span><span> ./docker /app/docker</span>
<span>ADD</span><span> ./backend /app/backend</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this <code>Dockerfile</code> the <code>python:3.8.3-alpine</code> is used as base image. Let’s decode this image name and tag. It contains python in version <code>3.8.3</code>, running in the Linux distribution <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/"><code>Alpine</code></a> which is lightweight. The purpose of using lightweight Linux is to have small image which will result in faster builds. You can of course use different base image. For purpose of this tutorial the <code>python:3.8.3-alpine</code> is sufficient.</p>

<p>We create <code>/app</code> directory in the container and copy <code>/backend/requirements.txt</code>. Then, <code>gunicorn</code> and all needed packages are installed. The backend source code is copied at the end of the container build. It is on purpose. It makes building faster. When you change something in the code (without changing the <code>requirements.txt</code> file), only the last line of the <code>Dockerfile</code> will be executed and the rest will be read from cache (of course if available).</p>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> is not executing any command, we will use <code>wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> script for this purpose.</p>

<h3 id="docker-entrypoint">Docker entrypoint</h3>

<p>Please add a new file <code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> and add execute rights to the file (it is a bash script):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># add execute rights</span>
<span>chmod</span> +x docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>until </span><span>cd</span> /app/backend/server
<span>do
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for server volume..."</span>
<span>done

until</span> ./manage.py migrate
<span>do
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for db to be ready..."</span>
    <span>sleep </span>2
<span>done</span>

./manage.py collectstatic <span>--noinput</span>

gunicorn server.wsgi <span>--bind</span> 0.0.0.0:8000 <span>--workers</span> 4 <span>--threads</span> 4

<span>#####################################################################################</span>
<span># Options to DEBUG Django server</span>
<span># Optional commands to replace abouve gunicorn command</span>

<span># Option 1:</span>
<span># run gunicorn with debug log level</span>
<span># gunicorn server.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 1 --threads 1 --log-level debug</span>

<span># Option 2:</span>
<span># run development server</span>
<span># DEBUG=True ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above script is waiting till serever volume and database is ready. It runs migration on database and collect static files. It runs <code>gunicorn</code> server with IP address <code>0.0.0.0</code> and (docker default IP) and port <code>8000</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>gunicorn</code> is running <code>4</code> workers with <code>4</code> threads each. You can set different numbers here. It depends on your machine. There are some heuristic rules that set number of workers as <code>4 * CPU cores</code> (see the <a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#workers">gunicorn docs</a>). If you are deploying application to machine with 1 CPU core, then you can use <code>4</code> workers. (Remember, it is just heuristic not an exact rule). Then you can specify how many threads will be running in each worker. In our case, there are <code>4</code> threads (<a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#threads">gunicorn docs</a>). This means that we can process <code>4 * 4 = 16</code> concurrent requests.</p>

<p><strong>1st Note:</strong> We are using <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for our development - it doesn’t support concurrency. We will need to replace SQLite with advanced database engine like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. I will replace database at the end of this tutorial to make final deployment. I think it is good to deploy application. We will practice deployment and code updates in the production. That’s why we are here.</p>

<p><strong>2nd Note:</strong> One more thing, I added other options to run Django server in <code>wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> which are commmented. Why? You might need them for debugging. The first option add logging to the console with debug level and run <code>gunicorn</code> with one worker and single thread. The second option runs Django development server with <code>DEBUG=True</code>. It needs setting environment variable and load it in <code>settings.py</code> with <a href="https://github.com/henriquebastos/python-decouple"><code>python-decouple</code></a> (for example), I will write about this in the future post.</p>

<h4 id="django-static-files">Django static files</h4>

<p>Before going further, let’s update <code>STATIC_URL</code> variable in the <code>backend/server/server/settings.py</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># backend/server/server/settings.py
</span>
<span>MEDIA_URL</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/media/'</span>
<span>STATIC_URL</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/django_static/'</span> 
<span>STATIC_ROOT</span> <span>=</span> <span>BASE_DIR</span> <span>/</span> <span>'django_static'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We overwrite <code>STATIC_URL</code> with a new value. All static files will be served with <code>/django_static/</code> in the URL. We add two new variables:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>MEDIA_URL</code> - it is URL for serving files uploaded to Django application, we will use it in future posts.</li>
  <li><code>STATIC_ROOT</code> - it is a directory where static files from Django application will be stored after running <code>collectstatic</code> command. The <code>nginx</code> will point to this path.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please add <code>nginx</code> directory in the <code>docker</code> directory. There will be added three files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/Dockerfile</code> - the instructions how to build <code>nginx</code> container image,</li>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/development/default.conf</code> - the configuration file for <code>nginx</code> server used in the development,</li>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/production/default.conf</code> - the configuration file for the production.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> for <code>nginx</code> container will use two stage build.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At first stage, we build the React static files.</li>
  <li>At second stage, the static files are copied and <code>nginx</code> server starts. We copy React static files into <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>docker/nginx/Dockerfile</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># The first stage</span>
<span># Build React static files</span>
<span>FROM</span><span> node:13.12.0-alpine as build</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app/frontend</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/package.json ./</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/package-lock.json ./</span>
<span>RUN </span>npm ci <span>--silent</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/ ./</span>
<span>RUN </span>npm run build

<span># The second stage</span>
<span># Copy React static files and start nginx</span>
<span>FROM</span><span> nginx:stable-alpine</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> --from=build /app/frontend/build /usr/share/nginx/html</span>
<span>CMD</span><span> ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the second stage, we copy only the final product of the first stage: static files. The <code>node_modules</code> (they can take a lot of space) with dependency files are not in the final image. Such two stage-build makes the size of the final image smaller.</p>

<p>Let’s add <code>nginx</code> configuration for development version of <code>docker-compose</code> (without SSL certificate):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span>

        <span>proxy_pass</span>   <span>http://backend:8000</span><span>;</span>

    <span>location</span> <span>/django_static/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>autoindex</span> <span>on</span><span>;</span>
        <span>alias</span> <span>/app/backend/server/django_static/</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you feel when you see <code>nginx</code> configuration file?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No troubles! The <code>nginx</code> is here to help us. It will do what we will ask in the configuration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_tokens</span> <span>off</span><span>;</span>
    <span>client_max_body_size</span> <span>20M</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the begining of the configuration we define a server (<code>server</code> keyword). It will listen on port <code>80</code> (it is a default <code>HTTP</code> port). There is no name assigned to the server (<code>server_name _;</code>). We switch off option to show server version on error pages (<code>server_token off;</code> <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server_tokens">see docs</a>). The last setting is to set maximum request size (<a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size">see docs</a>) (<code>client_max_body_size 20M</code>). It means that requests larger than 20MB will result in error with HTTP 413 (Request Entity Too Large).</p>

<p>We have five <code>location</code> blocks (<a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location">location docs</a>) in the config which specify configuration for each URL (routing for requests).</p>

<p>The first <code>location /</code> defines what to do if the request comes from <code>/</code> (main domain or IP). The <code>index.html</code> file from <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> will be served as a response. It is our React static <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>root</span>   <span>/usr/share/nginx/html</span><span>;</span>
        <span>index</span>  <span>index.html</span> <span>index.htm</span><span>;</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>$uri</span><span>/</span> <span>/index.html</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second and third locations <code>location /api</code> and <code>location /admin</code> redirect requests to <code>location @proxy_api</code>. It is a reverse-proxy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>location</span> <span>/api</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/admin</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What we have in fourth <code>location @proxy_api</code>? It is our Django application served with <code>gunicorn</code>. The <code>nginx</code> forwards all requests with <code>/api</code> and <code>/a…</code></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Regular 1-on-1 (often also written as 1:1) meetings are an important satisfaction factor for remote teams. For managers and companies, it's amazing to stay in the loop and resolve friction quickly. For employees, it's a rare chance to voice opinions and difficulties.</p>
<p>Especially in async environments and other remote teams where face-to-face time is sparse, this regularly scheduled personal time can be a&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's why 1-on-1s are extra important for remote teams, how they work best and why the greatest remote teams are so religious about them.</p>

<h2>What is a 1-on-1 meeting?</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, a 1-on-1 meeting is a discussion between two parties. 1-on-1s are traditionally conducted for things like <strong>performance reviews</strong> or <strong>confidential discussions</strong> between a manager and their direct report.</p>
<p>In remote teams, face-to-face time can be sparse. It's more difficult to catch someone during their coffee break and talk things out. More formally scheduled 1-on-1s can be the solution for that.</p>
<p>Other than what's traditional, it's not uncommon to have 1-on-1s <strong>outside the manager-report relationship</strong>, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>satisfaction survey between employee and HR</li>
<li>knowledge exchange between team leaders</li>
<li>pair review between peers, co-working</li>
</ul>
<p>But even the more traditional manger-report 1-on-1 meetings <strong>holds more weight</strong> in remote work: It's the one place where employees can voice concerns, talk about their growth, their goals or any friction that has come up.</p>

<h2>The benefits of 1-on-1s for remote employees and managers</h2>
<p>When it comes to remote employees, regularly scheduled 1-on-1 meetings are a miracle tool when it comes to retention and employee satisfaction. As mentioned, they are a welcome place to voice concerns early or talk about growth.</p>
<p>For ambitious employees that creates an atmosphere where friction can get moved out of the way quickly, where ears are always open for concerns and growth desires can be made explicit.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/undraw_Meeting_re_i53h.png" alt="" width="600" height="358"></p>

<p>That sounds like an amazing deal for any employee, but obviously, it also comes at a high cost for managers.</p>
<p>For a team with 8 direct reports, bi-weekly 1-on-1s at a duration of 30 minutes per meeting, that's a full workday of added meeting time every single month! What's in it for the managers?</p>
<p>The benefits for employees can be reversed and are just as important for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>get rid of friction early</li>
<li>know where reports want to be in their careers</li>
<li>stay in the loop about newest developments</li>
<li>better picture of morale and difficulties</li>
</ul>
<p>Given any actionable manager, this is definitely worth its time as actions can be taken that improve satisfaction and retention.</p>
<p>And indeed, <a href="https://www.leapsome.com/blog/meeting-with-purpose-the-unique-benefits-of-1-on-1-meetings">research shows</a> that while group meetings tend to lower employee satisfaction rates, 1-on-1 meetings actively improve that same metric!</p>

<h2>Productive 1-on-1 meetings methods</h2>
<p>1-on-1 meetings aren't hard to do right. As long as they are scheduled consistently and follows a common path – besides having a culture that allows for honest feedback – there's definitely a benefit to doing them.</p>
<p>As with so many things, some people have taken it a step further and created detailed methods and best practises to running 1-on-1 meetings.</p>

<h3>The traffic light check-in</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.connorswenson.com/blog/red-yellow-green-the-traffic-light-that-can-transform-your-meetings">traffic light check-in</a>, also called "Red Yellow Green" check-in is one of the meeting methods that has brought success to companies like Google, Etsy and many startups. So much, in fact, it's being taught by executive and management coaches around the world.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/eliobed-suarez-PN-YnI5stdQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>

<p>The concept is quite simple: If we take a traffic light as a model, your 1-on-1 partner describes their mood as one of the colors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green</strong> means everything is OK, nothing that dampens the mood or blocks you from being near your peak. Let's talk.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> means so-so. Maybe things are stressful or there's an upcoming blocker. Let's discuss.</li>
<li><strong>Red</strong> is bad! The person is overwhelmed, blocked or is feeling terrible. Let's solve this.</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative form of this is to collect topics and assign them to each of the colors, for example, <strong>green</strong> describes all the things that were great,&nbsp;<strong>yellow</strong> includes discussion topics that could have gone better and&nbsp;<strong>red</strong> are priority discussion points about things that failed.</p>

<h3>Skip-level meetings</h3>
<p>A skip-level meeting "skips" one layer of responsibility and is usually conducted with the person's manager's manager or even a head of department or CEO.</p>
<p>For remote teams, this can be a great irregular thing to schedule. On one side, employees have the possibility to discuss wider changes and bring up interesting ideas, while managers and executives have a more direct line to the culture and issues of their sub-reports.</p>
<p>Skip-level meetings are usually not done more than once per year per 1-on-1 combination, for leaders, however, it can be a good idea to schedule these monthly or even bi-weekly to have a deeper look into different teams.</p>

<h3>Goal and growth conversations</h3>
<p>A growth (or goal) conversation is different from the regular 1-on-1 check-ins as that it's designed to be a more formal evaluation and discussion. Other than the more traditional performance evaluation, it's a discussion around goals, current progress and growth.</p>
<p>As such, it doesn't have much influence on things like salaries or promotions but instead can help to improve employee satisfaction. In fact, <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/career-development-and-job-satisfaction/career-development-an-enabler-for-job-satisfaction">research shows</a> that the major reason for employee satisfaction boils down to career development, so it's something that shouldn't be dismissed.</p>
<p>Growth conversations happen more often than traditional evaluations – usually every quarter up to once per month – and help answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my short-term goal?</li>
<li>Did I reach my goal last time?</li>
<li>What stopped/enabled me to reach my goal?</li>
<li>What is my big goal for the next year?</li>
<li>What is my progress in reaching that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the situation, these conversations can be difficult. For ambitious employees, however, they could be the main driver in motivation, engagement, loyalty and retention.</p>

<h2>7 Tips for better 1-on-1 meetings</h2>
<p>When it comes to 1-on-1 meetings, learning by doing is the keyword. Even if you don't have a plan for them, to start today is to begin the investment in retention and loyalty.</p>
<p>Before you go, though, we hope that these practical tips can help you get started with better 1-on-1 meetings.</p>

<h3>1. Start with an agenda</h3>
<p>It's good practice to set up a way for you and your meeting partner to build an <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/remote-meeting-best-practices/">agenda before the call</a>. Some popular methods to do so are Google Docs and <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/todoist/">Todoist</a>, where projects can be shared between two people.</p>
<p>The great part – simple to solve questions can be solved in writing even before the meeting and when it comes to harder discussions, your meeting partner can prepare for those beforehand. It also helps to keep meetings running smoothly and ending on time.</p>

<h3>2. Stick to a type of meeting</h3>
<p>A little earlier in this post, we described a few popular meeting techniques. While you can tweak meetings and even switch them around, it's usually good to stick to a certain interval and meeting form for a while, to make sure it works out.</p>
<p>Sticking to something for a while helps both of you to settle into a certain flow and helps with evaluating how good something works.</p>

<h3>3. Keep async stuff away</h3>
<p>In the first point, we talked about getting simple questions out of the way early through your agenda. Your agenda items should be evaluated whether they <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/making-asynchronous-communication-work/">should have been an email</a> – or a message – instead.</p>
<p>For example, it feels natural to give a status update during these meetings and checking in whether everything is on track. However, it's a better practice to write this down somewhere and have it recorded – so it can be crossed away from the meeting agenda.</p>
<p>Instead, the meeting should include socialization, talking about emotional topics and hashing out difficult discussions.</p>

<h3>4. Stay consistent</h3>
<p>As with anything, consistency is key! As you go into this new form of collaboration, give yourself the challenge to keep up with it for a few months or even a year.</p>
<p>It's important to keep each other accountable, so pick a specific timeslot, reserve a calendar block and don't make these optional. While some of them can be skipped, it shouldn't become the norm.</p>

<h3>5. Take notes</h3>
<p>Taking notes during the discussion can help you recall information, go back to previous meetings and find patterns and also help you to digest the information on the next day.</p>
<p>Hopefully, good notes can help you read between the lines and see recurring themes that are being discussed again and again.</p>

<h3>6. Build action items</h3>
<p>We all love homework, don't we! For 1-on-1 meetings, however, it could be a good idea to set agenda items and to-dos for the next meeting already, so-called action items.</p>
<p>These action items are usually not about the core work, but instead about the topics that were discussed – specific thoughts about growths or an issue that has been cumbersome for a few weeks.</p>

<h3>7. Run regular retrospectives</h3>
<p>1-on-1s are never set in stone! The great part about running these small meetings is that changes can happen quickly and easily – so, if anything doesn't work for you about these 1-on-1 meetings, change it! Be it timing, frequency, agenda or format, let none of it undiscovered!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A week ago, I was looking for something to tinker with over the weekend. I ended up switching my site hosting from GitHub Pages to Netlify.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/">comparison was compelling</a>. I was appealed by the 1-click rollbacks, ability to use more Jekyll plug-ins, and A/B testing my site (fun!).</p>
<p>However, I switched back to GitHub Pages today. Why?</p>
<h2 id="my-mx-records-werent-migrated-automatically">My MX records werenâ€™t migrated automatically</h2>
<p>(MX records are DNS records for delivery email to your address.)</p>
<p>When I switched my DNS servers to Netlify, it was pretty painless: Update the DNS name servers, provision the cert, and weâ€™re good to go.</p>
<p>However, I didnâ€™t realize that my MX records werenâ€™t automatically migrated as well. (When I previously moved to Cloudflare, this was taken care of).</p>
<p>As a result, emails to my domain bounced for a few days before I noticed. Thankfully, people reached out via other channels to inform me of it.</p>
<h2 id="adding-mx-records-on-the-dns-provider-was-a-pain">Adding MX records on the DNS provider was a pain</h2>
<p>Trying to add the MX records with the DNS provider, NS1, was a pain.</p>
<p>I had to create an account with NS1 and provide them with credit card details. (Update: Was charged $2 within a day; will enquire why).</p>
<p>Then, I had to set up a â€œZoneâ€� to attach the MX records. However, when I tried setting up the zone for my domain, it was not allowed as the domain already exists. Probably from the Netlify integration.</p>
<p>I spent some time trying to figure this out. I also asked some Netlify folks. Turns out that while they use Netlify to host their site, they use other DNS providers (instead of NS1).</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-custom-certificate-didnt-work">Adding the custom certificate didnâ€™t work</h2>
<p>By now, Iâ€™ve switched my DNS provider back to Cloudflare, and added the Cloudflare Origin cert to my Netlify app. (I really wanted to continue using Netlify.)</p>
<p>However, I soon got complaints that people couldnâ€™t access my site due to the error: â€œPeerâ€™s Certificate issuer is not recognized.â€�. I faced the same issue too. Iâ€™m not sure where the issue lies (cert or host) but I had lost patience by now.</p>
<h2 id="another-gotcha-300-build-minutes-monthly">Another gotcha: 300 build minutes monthly</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/">GitHub Pages vs Netlify comparison</a> indicates that both are free, with Netlify being superior at 3 builds a minute, it leaves out one major gotcha: On the free tier, Netlify only provides 300 minutes of build time monthly. AFAIK, GitHub Pages has no limitations.</p>
<p>For someone who frequently adds and tweaks content, and mucks around with the CSS and whatnot, 300 minutes didnâ€™t last long.</p>
<p>On its own, this limitation would have been bearableâ€”I figured I would try to be more frugal. But the DNS issues broke the camelâ€™s back.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-github-pages">Back to GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>Now, Iâ€™m back to hosting on GitHub Pages and merrily pushing updates as inspiration strikes. Previously, I was checking the build minutes remaining ever so often.</p>
<p>I guess Iâ€™ll have to do without the fancy Jekyll plug-ins, 3 builds/min, and A/B testing for now. In return, I get peace of mind.</p>

<p><em>Edit: Thank you to the 80k people who have read this piece. It looks like many people are struggling with the concept of "greatness". Let's continue to support one another on the journey there. </em></p><p>Over the years, we’ve all encountered our fair share of successes and failures. As I’ve acquired more of both under my name, I’ve started to contemplate which experiences were truly “great” and why.</p><p>Interestingly enough, I realized that it was not the sporadic highs that were exceptional, but instead the long hauls; the sequences of events that seemed minimal at each juncture, but compounded into major gains. This led me to think further about what <em>greatness</em> truly means. I’ve come to learn that it’s not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Perhaps “great’, is just “good”, but repeatable. </strong></em></blockquote><h2 id="consider-this">Consider This</h2><p>Before stepping into the bulk of this article, I want to clarify two things:</p><ul><li>Greatness is not instantaneous</li><li>Greatness is earned</li></ul><p>The first step in becoming great is recognizing that you’re likely not already great. In fact, it comes from recognizing that there is no such thing as greatness at a specific instance in time. Greatness is instead a reflection of a period of effort, since greatness in a single instance can be reduced to luck. </p><p>Moreover, being “great” is not about being better than someone else. It is about being dependable and disciplined, and ultimately it is earned. </p><p>Many people, in theory, want to be “great”. In fact, each month 1000 people search “how to be great”, 260 people search “how to become perfect”, and 2400 people search “how to be the best”, looking for discrete answers on how to get from 0 to 1. Yet, many people in life realistically do not want to put in the effort over a sustained period of time to actually get to 1. They are looking for the “secrets to success” that in many ways, do not exist. You know what brings success? Hard work brings success. </p><p>So before proceeding forward in this article, I implore each of you to consider that if greatness truly is a reflection of non-instantaneous, earned effort, ask yourself if that’s the life you’d like to live. Ask yourself whether you’d like to spend your days, weeks, months, and years in a constant uphill battle. </p><p>If you ultimately find that you don’t want to do that, that’s fine! It doesn’t make you less of a person. At least you’ve broken from the holding pattern of thinking you want to do X but not understanding why you haven’t gotten there yet. And if that’s the case, go enjoy your Netflix and chill completely guilt-free.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s dive into what truly makes someone “great’. </p><h2 id="it-s-hard-to-be-consistent">It’s Hard to be Consistent</h2><p>There’s a false impression that success or notoriety comes with being flashy. This notion comes from the media focusing on outliers, whether it be events or personalities which diverge from the norm. Not only can this encourage people to aim for notoriety just for the sake of it (think Elizabeth Holmes), but it makes the rest of us believe that correlation (of those outliers) is causation; in other words, success of those individuals is due to their offbeat ways. But here’s another storyline: the most sure and therefore the <em>best</em> way to “success” is through consistency.</p><blockquote><em>“Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.”</em> - James Clear, <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a></blockquote><p>To be clear, consistency isn’t necessarily the easiest way to success, but one that can be achieved with a higher level of certainty, rather than hoping for a lottery win or someone to “discover” you. Continuous effort is a more thoughtful approach that leads to greatness when the following statements are true:</p><ol><li>Inputs are consistent over time</li><li>Intentional inputs lead to expected outputs</li></ol><h3 id="consistency">Consistency<br></h3><blockquote><em>“No one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich”</em> - <a href="https://amzn.to/2Fcnn4K">Outliers</a></blockquote><p>There is a famous saying from Napolean Hill which says, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way”</em>. I would actually argue the quote should be, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things a great number of times”.</em></p><p>If you don’t have the opportunity to “do great things”, focus on consistently achieving small wins. These small things in fact do not need to be done in a great way, but a good way, repeatably. In fact, I would advise not to focus on perfection, as it is often the enemy of the successful. </p><p>There’s glimmer and hoopla around unpredictability, but in reality, it’s much more difficult and therefore impressive, to be predictably good. For example:</p><ul><li>It’s easy to wake up whenever you “feel like it”. </li><li>It’s hard to stick to a routine of getting up at 6AM.</li><li>It’s easy to pivot from side project to side project, focusing on the new shiny object of the month.</li><li>It’s hard to stick with a side project for years, many of which may not be profitable for a long while. </li><li>It’s easy to give up on someone when you hit a roadblock or the next potential partner becomes available. </li><li>It’s hard to be faithful and invest in a relationship for decades.</li></ul><p>We normally set out in life with good intentions. We <em>intend</em> to set a morning routine or work on a business until it's profitable or to “love someone forever”. We imagine that as we invest in something, we will naturally continue to move in the right direction. If anything, things will get easier, right?</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NQV_7RXfM2ZYDJsT4E4JAaAW2i9KphrB7-fE8XveJlrW-Msf1aIot9ayls-wSCWIroq155Fzdz6vE3d8br71E6Tc5sTQRyhnT0Zb6EJCUoV41B5EoZSczjtWcHo9KV-T9c6s16Cb"></figure><p>The described trajectory is what we perceive on the left. Predictable, linear, and a direct reflection of effort put in. </p><p><strong>Rarely does success in anything look like that.</strong> Life is a series of tiny nodes that tend to look more like the right hand side. There two key elements worth calling out in the more realistic graph on the right:</p><ul><li>Compounding is always present. The earlier steps in any process will be more strenuous, yet it’s difficult to imagine the potential compounding that comes later on. </li><li>With the ups, there are always downs. This seems obvious, but we often forget this when we are in periods of down. We quit at these local minimums (the highlighted sections in red above), because we cannot see the next peak right around the corner. </li></ul><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>a friend just emailed me this note in response to my 'burn out' video. wanted to share;</p><p>'the addiction to having success is what makes you feel unsuccessful at the times when you're not feeling the immediate dopamine hit of your work 'succeeding' at that precise moment.'</p></div>— Casey Neistat (@Casey) <a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1093520669286064133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have lost our ability to appreciate delayed gratification and, some of us who struggle with perfectionism, can either create repeatedly until we ‘get it right’ never truly feeling fulfilled with our work, or, we avoid creating all together in fear of failing.</p>— Marcio Novelli (@MarcioNovelli) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcioNovelli/status/1093522120536150017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The local minima are especially psychologically taxing due to something called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">Hedonic treadmill</a> or hedonic adaptation. Essentially, as someone achieves new successes in various aspects of their lives, their baseline shifts to reflect that new level and therefore, their expectations and desires are re-established as well. There is no net gain in happiness and thus, it becomes even more difficult to stay “level-headed” during these down moments. </p><p>That is exactly why a specific search for success can be problematic and instead of looking for unsustainable shortcuts in life, it’s much more effective (and healthy) to aim for continuous habits that bring you success as a byproduct, not as the end goal.</p><blockquote><em>“The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.” - <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a>, James Clear</em></blockquote><p>On your journey to greatness, you need to fall in love with the process which includes many local minima and maxima. Staying consistent and pushing through both of these continuously is what will truly differentiate you from those that are simply “good” and isolate you as one of the few that are “great’.</p><h3 id="inputs-outputs">Inputs → Outputs</h3><p>The second important aspect of achieving greatness is acting with intention. Your actions and results will not always reflect your intentions, but as you move towards “greatness”, you should have a better idea of what inputs actually deliver output. You’ll still make mistakes﹣as we all do﹣but you’ll have a better grasp on what is more likely to work out. For example, your success rate may be 30%, versus someone flying blind with a 5% success rate. </p><p>Let’s look at a simple example:</p><p>Imagine company X has two sales people. Salesperson A happens to land a $1M deal in his first week. However, he struggles to land anything substantial for the next 6 months. Meanwhile, salesperson B manages to develop a process over the first month, bringing in only $100k which he’s able to scale up and double month over month.</p><p>After six months, this will be the revenue generated by each party.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.stephsmith.io/content/images/2019/05/image-5.png"></figure><p>You’re probably thinking… "So what? That’s just a classic example of compounding." </p><p>Yes! That’s exactly the point. The best things in life often aren’t miracles, but well-thought out approaches that are sustainable. The same thing is true with businesses, marriages, and just about anything with repeatable elements. If you invest time into solving for what leads to success continuously, you will reap those benefits for years to come. <em>So even in the least quantifiable situations, reflect back on what could’ve made a previous loss a future win. </em></p><p>Consider the best companies over time. None of them emerged overnight, nor was there a single inflection point that determined the success or notoriety of these companies. The line of separation between the “great” companies of all time and the “not so great”, is their ability to stand the test of time. </p><p>Would you rather be Juicero that <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/juicero">raised $100M</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/rip-juicero-the-400-venture-backed-juice-machine/">went bankrupt</a> within a year of its Series C, or Zoom, which <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zoom-video-communications/funding_rounds/funding_rounds_list#section-funding-rounds">took almost 8 years to take on more funding than $30M</a> and is now one of the most profitable and highly sought after “unicorns” in the valley?</p><p>On top of consistency, greatness comes from asking the right questions and iterating to learn what …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

    <p>To capture your ideas and turn them into tangible products, mind mapping software is a must. During the brainstorming process, ideas happen quickly, and if not appropriately tracked, can become overwhelming.
There are many reasons that mind mapping software is the best solution for this. To fully understand the benefit it can provide to your organization, it’s best to explore the concept of mind mapping and how it helps bring projects to life.</p>

<h2>The concept of mind mapping</h2>
<p>The concept of mind mapping stems from extracting useful ideas and developing links between them. During the brainstorming process ideas flow freely, but sometimes connections are not immediately noticeable. This makes the process of putting these ideas together and creating plan for an entire project extremely difficult. This is where mind mapping plays a critical role.</p>
<p>The best way to describe a mind map is a hierarchical tree is it shows a natural progression between ideas. A mind map separates a project into modular components and then breaks those down into even more specific tasks.</p>
<h2>What is mind mapping software?</h2>
<p>Although mind-mapping is possible by hand, utilizing mind mapping software is a modern and more refined way to get the job done. Utilizing these mind mapping tools enables a project leader to visualize and build out their projects. Generating a mind map by hand can take quite a bit of time, so specialized mind mapping apps condense the process and streamline delivery.</p>
<h2>Best mind mapping software to improve your productivity</h2>
<p>Within the software world, many mind mapping solutions exist. It isn’t difficult to find software for any platform, including the cloud.

<h2>How to pick a mind map tool</h2>
<p>To pick the best mind mapping tool for your unique situation, there are a few factors that should be considered. Depending on your individual needs, you may find that some software lacks a few essential items that are critical for your purposes.
Here are the major factors that should play into your decision.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Team access</h3>
    <p>If you are working on a project that requires multiple team members to access mind maps and edit them simultaneously, you’ll need to consider this. Some mind mapping software does not allow for real-time editing, although it’s supported in most. If you need this feature, then consider Miro or Coggle.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>More than mind maps</h3>
    <p>If you plan on doing more than just mind-mapping for your project, you’ll need to keep this in mind when picking a mind mapping software. While all of the aforementioned software is excellent for mind mapping, some options stand out and are exemplary for other tasks and different diagram types. Mind Meister and Coggle allow for unparalleled customization of charts.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Integrations</h3>
    <p>If you intend to integrate your mind maps into social media or utilize existing technologies—such as Google Drive or Microsoft 365—you’ll need to make sure it’s supported with the mind mapping software you choose. Two excellent options for this are Mindmup and Miro.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Supported platforms</h3>
    <p>You’ll also need to consider which platforms are supported by each type of mind mapping software. If your organization is primarily Apple-based, you’ll need to select mind mapping software compatible with Mac. Your best bet is to choose an option that is cloud-based so it works across all platforms and devices.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Budget</h3>
    <p>Your last consideration will be your budget for mind mapping software. If you have a complex set of projects that need many detailed diagrams, you’ll need to make sure that you select a software option that fits with your budget and allows you the mind maps you need.</p>
</div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, there are many different types of mind mapping software available that fit a variety of needs. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so it’s best to make a list of your needs, and then start shopping to find the mind mapping software for you.
A great place to start would be to select a few of the options that offer free plans, and start creating a mind map focused on selecting the best mind mapping software. This will give you a real-world view of the features so you can select the software solution that’s right for you.</p>

<p>by Sven Nilsen, 2020</p>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/poi">Poi 0.18</a> is released!</p>

<p>In this blog post I will discuss the new Levenshtein heuristic used in Poi.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advancedresearch/advancedresearch.github.io/master/images/lev.png" alt="Levenshtein distance"></p>

<p><em>The Levenshtein distance measures minimum single-character changes between two strings.<br>
It is named after Vladimir Levenshtein, which considered this distance in 1965 (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Wikipedia</a>)</em></p>

<h3 id="why-automated-theorem-proving-is-hard">Why automated theorem proving is hard</h3>

<p>Automated theorem proving is hard for the same reason the boardgame chess is hard.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number">The Shannon number</a> is a conservative lower bound
of the game-tree complexity of chess: 10^120.
This is more than the number of atoms in the observable universe.</p>

<p>However, in automated theorem proving, the complexity is sometimes countable infinity.
With other words, if one tries to search the whole space of possible proofs, the program will run forever.</p>

<h3 id="heuristic-measurements">Heuristic measurements</h3>

<p>In order to prioritize search of possible proofs, one needs a heuristic.</p>

<p>Here, the word “heuristic” means the same as e.g. using utility to optimize course of action for AI agents.
In fact, an automated theorem prover is very much alike an AI agent, except there are no interactions with an environment.
The automated theorem prover usually lives in a world with “perfect information”, aka chess.
However, there is no opponent. Instead, the “opponent” is the complexity of math itself.</p>

<p>The following properties was desirable when choosing a heuristic measurement for Poi:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reaches minimum value when reaching goal</li>
  <li>Smooth gradient when getting closer to the goal</li>
  <li>Rule agnostic</li>
  <li>Easy to maintain</li>
</ul>

<p>My first idea of how this heuristic should look like,
was something that used sub-expressions matching with the goal.</p>

<p>I was thinking about how difficult this would be to code.</p>

<p>Then, I realized that I was thinking too complicated: Why not use strings instead of expressions?</p>

<h3 id="levenshtein-distance">Levenshtein distance</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">The Levenshtein distance</a> is the minimum number of
single-character edits required to transform one string into another string.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lev("a + b", "c + d") = 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because you only need to replace <code>a</code> with <code>c</code> and <code>b</code> with <code>d</code> in the first string to get the second string.</p>

<p>The Levenshtein distance also allows adding and removing characters, but not swapping them.</p>

<p>At first sight, it might seem a bit hacky to use strings this way,
when we are talking about a theorem prover which uses complex expressions behind the scenes.</p>

<p>However: It satisfies all the properties I mentioned above!</p>

<p>For example, an alternative could be to use machine learning,
which would become gradually better at assisting the theorem prover over time.
In this case, you would probably use strings, bytes or numbers to feed the neural network.
Would you consider this to be a hacky solution too?</p>

<p>I am interested in hearing what people think about what they consider a hacky heuristic versus a more robust heuristic.</p>

<p>So, why not just use a simple string algorithm?
After thinking about this, I decided to go for it, because I could not figure out any rational reason to not do it.</p>

<h3 id="try-first-learn-afterwards">Try first, learn afterwards</h3>

<p>How did I figure out whether Levenshtein distance was the right heuristic to use?</p>

<p>I simply added <a href="https://crates.io/crates/levenshtein">levenshtein</a> to the Cargo.toml
and coded for a few hours: Turned out that it works pretty well.</p>

<p>It took a couple iterations to get it right.
At first, the algorithm just picked the minimum Levenshtein distance from unreduced equivalences.
This worked surprisingly well, but more testing revealed that this algorithm was not sound.</p>

<p>I ended up with using <code>std::collections::{BinaryHeap, HashSet}</code> instead,
picking the minimum Levenshtein distance across all sub-proofs found so far.
This algorithm fixes the soundness problem, but uses a lot of memory.</p>

<p>Only after getting it working, I learned more about the theory behind Levenshtein distance in detail.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-about-the-design">Thoughts about the design</h3>

<p>Since Levenshtein is not very good at strings where substrings are swapped,
I believe it will perform less well on commutative operators.</p>

<p>However, I believe that using the normal exhaustive search up to some depth,
will resolve some of the issues with commutativity.</p>

<p>The problem is how to deal with large expressions and lots of commutative operators, e.g. addition.
In this case, increasing the depth of exhaustive search will lead to significant slowdown.</p>

<p>One approach to solving this problem, is to assist the automated theorem prover by designing proper utility rules.</p>

<p>This is something I am testing now, by designing worst-case proofs and doing some experiments.</p>

<h3 id="utility-rules">Utility rules</h3>

<p>Utility rules are rules that can be proved from existing rules, e.g.:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x0 + x1 + x2 + x3 &lt;=&gt; x0 + x3 + x2 + x1;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The expression <code>x0 + x1 + x2 + x3</code> is constructed similarly to a linked list (sort of).</p>

<p>The left-most term <code>x0</code> functions as a “tail” that pattern matches anywhere in the expression.
Keeping the left-most term fixed on both sides makes it possible to manipulate the expression at any depth,
instead of manipulating only at the leafs.</p>

<p>This is important when there are long chains of commutative operators,
because it avoids transformations via tree-like structures, which requires many more steps.</p>

<p>Although you can in principle prove the same using <code>a + b &lt;=&gt; b + a</code> only,
the automated theorem prover can not look that many steps ahead to make a realistic estimate using the Levenshtein distance.</p>

<h3 id="future-improvements">Future improvements</h3>

<p>In one test run I am running while writing this blog post, Poi uses 500 MiB of memory.</p>

<p>I might replace <code>HashSet</code> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_filter">Cuckoo filter</a> (an improved Bloom filter) in the future,
in order to lower memory usage.</p>

<p>Also, I would like a replacement for <code>BinaryHeap</code> which uses less memory.</p>

<p>Thinking a bit about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">Trie</a> or finite state machines, as in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fst">fst</a> crate.</p>

<p>The problem is, I need to pop the minimum sorted by some numeric key.</p>

<p>Basically, I want something behaving like <code>BinaryHeap</code>, but more efficient for strings.</p>

<p>A minor improvement in performance could be to reuse the cache used in the Levenshtein algorithm.</p>

<p>At this stage, I am mostly focusing on testing that things work,
but in the future I might be focusing to how long time it takes to complete the proof search.
I have not decided yet whether the REPL should have built-in benchmarks or whether the REPL code should be refactored for running external benchmarks.</p>

<p>Allegedly “Kernel Text Readonly Region”.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>This post tries to detail the mechanism used in Apple’s A10 chips and later to prevent modification of an iOS kernel at runtime.<br>
Older chips attempt to do this via a monitor program loaded in EL3, which is inherently flawed and bypassable though as detailed in <a href="https://xerub.github.io/ios/kpp/2017/04/13/tick-tock.html">“Tick Tock” by xerub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>On some sites you’ll see the term “memory-mapped registers” being thrown around. To avoid confusion I will not use that term, but instead:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Register” to mean actual registers such as those accessed by the arm64 <code>msr</code> instruction. Each CPU core has its own copy of such registers, and the values held by them will be lost when the core goes to sleep.</li>
  <li>“MMIO” (memory-mapped I/O) to mean a portion of the physical address that can be used to interact with a device on the SoC. Like regular RAM, this is global to the entire SoC and does not lose its values when any core goes to sleep, as it is a separate device.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that code shown here will often have been shortened, expanding or removing macros that are assumed to be defined (<code>KERNEL_INTEGRITY_KTRR</code>, <code>MACH_BSD</code>, <code>__arm64__</code>) or not (<code>DEVELOPMENT</code>, <code>DEBUG</code>).</p>

<h3 id="primitives">Primitives</h3>

<p>Besides abandoning EL3 altogether (leaving only EL1 and EL0), A10 chips introduce two new hardware features that serve as the corner stones for KTRR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“RoRgn”<br>
A piece of MMIO consisting of a “start”, “end” and “lock” fields. The “lock” field, when   written to, will lock down all three fields, i.e. prevent any modification of them. The start and end fields hold numbers of pages in DRAM, spanning up the RoRgn. Inside this region, the memory controller will reject any and all attempted writes.<br>
XNU has three macros to refer to them:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>#define rRORGNBASEADDR (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7e4))
#define rRORGNENDADDR  (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7e8))
#define rRORGNLOCK     (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7ec))
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>“KTRR registers”<br>
A set of three registers added to every CPU core, holding “low”, “high” and “lock” values respectively. The lock register, again, locks all three down. The low and high registers hold physical addresses, spanning up the executable range. If the CPU is at EL1 and the MMU is turned on, then any instruction fetch (i.e. trying to execute memory) outside of that range will fail, even if it is marked as executable in the page table. If the CPU is at EL0 or if the MMU is turned off, this range has no effect.<br>
For those too, XNU has macros:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_LOWER_EL1                        S3_4_c15_c2_3
#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_UPPER_EL1                        S3_4_c15_c2_4
#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_LOCK_EL1                         S3_4_c15_c2_2
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Also it is worth mentioning another feature that was present in past chips already, but is set up differently now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“IORVBAR”<br>
A piece of MMIO holding one field for every CPU, designating the physical address at which it will start executing on “reset” (basically when waking from sleep). This too has a locking mechanism, which is activated by writing to it a value that as its least significant bit set to 1.<br>
On A9 CPUs and earlier this was set to a physical address inside TrustZone, where WatchTower (KPP) resides. Since A10, this is set to <code>LowResetVectorBase</code> as found in XNU, which iBoot calculates from the kernel’s entry point as outlined by this comment:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>/*
 * __start trampoline is located at a position relative to LowResetVectorBase
 * so that iBoot can compute the reset vector position to set IORVBAR using
 * only the kernel entry point.  Reset vector = (__start &amp; ~0xfff)
 */</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-theory">In theory</h3>

<p>The above primitives are virtually unbreakable due to their locking mechanism, but do by themselves not protect a running kernel. In order to look at what else is needed, we have to look a potential attacks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>(Asserted:) The primitives need to actually uphold what they promise.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to disable any protections or choose to not enable them, thus they must be set up and locked down before the attacker can gain code execution.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch any data you consider critical, so all of it needs to be inside the RoRgn. This sounds obvious in theory, but in practise a bunch of critical things are easily overlooked.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch page tables that are used to map memory from the RoRgn, otherwise they can copy said memory to a writeable location and patch page tables to point there instead. Such page tables must thus be inside the RoRgn themselves.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to employ a custom page table hierarchy, so the translation table base register that maps the kernel’s half of the address space (<code>ttbr1_el1</code> in this case) must be unchangeable.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch or inject any executable memory, otherwise they could add the instruction <code>msr ttbr1_el1, x0</code> and gain the ability to change <code>ttbr1_el1</code>. Therefore the “executable range” must be a strict subset of the RoRgn.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to turn off the MMU, since when the MMU is off all pages are considered executable and an attacker could again inject <code>msr ttbr1_el1, x0</code>. The MMU status is controlled by the least significant bit of the register <code>sctlr_el1</code>, so said register must to be unchangeable as well during normal operation.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to gain code execution before the MMU is turned on (for afore mentioned reasons). Since a CPU starts out with the MMU turned off when it wakes from sleep, this means IORVBAR must point to memory within the RoRgn, and any code executed before the MMU is turned on must not have its control flow controlled by data outside the RoRgn.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="in-practice">In practice</h3>

<p>So let’s examine how iOS implements all of the above:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>IORVBAR is the first primitive to be fully set up, done so by iBoot before it jumps to the kernel’s entry point. Loaded and locked down all in one go.<br>
RoRgn gets its start and end values set by iBoot as well, but is not locked down yet. This is necessary because a lot of the data that is later readonly actually needs one-time initialisation, which is done by the kernel itself. I’ll skip over most kernel bootstrapping here, but after setting up virtual memory and all const data including kexts, we arrive at <code>kernel_bootstrap_thread</code>, part of which reads:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>machine_lockdown_preflight</span><span>();</span>

    <p>The first thing we’re interested in is <code>machine_lockdown_preflight</code>, which is just a wrapper around <code>rorgn_stash_range</code> that grabs the values computed by iBoot, translates them to physical addresses and stahes them in RoRgn memory for later:</p>
    <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>rorgn_stash_range</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>

    <p>Next, <code>arm_vm_prot_finalize</code> patches page tables for the main kernel binary one last time before they become readonly, removing the writeable flag from all const and code regions.<br>
And then, right before <code>bsd_init</code> there is a call to <code>machine_lockdown</code>, which is a wrapper around <code>rorgn_lockdown</code>. This call seems to have been <code>#ifdef</code>‘ed out of public sources, but if we compare a few functions to some disassembly, it’s evident a call to <code>machine_lockdown</code> was inlined there:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                                <p>An overview of the ECS system scheduling problem, the constraints a
prospective solution should consider, and a pair of algorithm examples.</p>
<p><em>This article is written within the context of Rust language ecosystem and
describes concepts mostly relevant to ECS (entity-component-system).
However, no knowledge of the ECS paradigm, Rust's ecosystem, or even Rust
language is necessary for understanding its ideas and conclusions.</em></p>

<p>Behavior of an ECS program is described by one or several "systems" -
the "S" part of ECS - functions that operate on the shared data contained within
the "EC" part.
ECS paradigm is used almost exclusively in the context of game and engine
programming, with some set of systems the program contains normally running
every "frame" - a pre-determined time interval, not necessarily tied to the
video frame rate.
The amount of time required for all systems in a set to finish their work for
the frame can be referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makespan">makespan</a> of the set.</p>
<p>The time a single system needs in order to be done for the frame is usually
not known beforehand, because it usually scales with the data the system
operates on.
Said data can change at runtime, often through user input.</p>
<p>For performance's sake - to minimize the makespan - it's sometimes desirable to
have several of these systems executed at the same time, in parallel.
In practice, however, systems often operate on intersecting sets of data,
which necessitates the use of some kind of synchronization mechanism.</p>
<p>Said mechanism can't be a simple lock over the shared data, since that would
force the execution of systems to be sequential.
It can be several orthogonal locks, but that's not the most performant approach,
and runs the risk of deadlocking in a naive implementation.</p>
<p>A more popular solution is to employ a special algorithm - a "scheduler" -
that queues systems to run in a way that has better utilization of processing
resources (read: threads, since a thread can be running only one system at
a time) than running them sequentially, yet doesn't violate data access rules,
without the need for locks.
(In Rust these rules state that data may be changed from only one place
at a time, and data that may be changed elsewhere cannot be read.)
The problem of finding such an algorithm is closely related to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessor_scheduling">multiprocessor scheduling</a> problem; finding the optimal schedule for the
systems, assuming their run times are known, is always NP-hard.</p>
<p>For an ECS program to be schedulable it needs to be executable at least
sequentially, i.e. whatever constraints on system order execution it might have
must not contain cycles of dependencies - the systems must form an acyclic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_graph">disjunctive graph</a>.
Execution order will be elaborated upon further in the article; for now, the
set  will be said to contain all such programs:</p>

<p>An ECS program  consisting of 
systems is further defined as such:</p>

<p>where  is an individual system, 
is the time it needs to complete its work, and 
is the set of data it operates on. Then, a scheduling
algorithm  is a mapping of  to
some schedule :</p>

<p>The makespan  is the optimal makespan for a
given ,  is the makespan
of , and  is the practical
worst-case makespan of executing all systems of  in
sequence:</p>

<p>The problem then can be stated as finding</p>

<p>and, ideally,</p>

<p>In this article, two systems are described as disjoint if running them in
parallel would not violate access rules,
i.e. .
If the rules would be violated, the systems are intersecting,
i.e. .</p>
<p>Disjointedness is not necessarily transitive. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>system <code>0</code> with required access to <code>A</code></li>
<li>system <code>1</code> with <code>B</code></li>
<li>system <code>2</code> with <code>A</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Systems <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are disjoint, systems <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> are disjoint, yet <code>0</code> and
<code>2</code> intersect; or, .</p>
<p>Likewise, intersection is also not necessarily transitive. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>system <code>0</code> with required access to <code>A</code></li>
<li>system <code>1</code> with <code>A</code> and <code>B</code></li>
<li>system <code>2</code> with <code>B</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Systems <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> intersect, systems <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> intersect, yet <code>0</code> and <code>2</code>
are disjoint; or, .</p>

<p>The first instinct is to generate an execution schedule once, when the scheduler
is first defined and populated.
Even if doing so is NP-hard, it wouldn't be a constant cost, seeing as changes
to  are comparatively rare in practice, if there are any
at all.</p>
<p>One way or another, a sequence of sets of disjoint systems is produced; when
the schedule is executed, sets are iterated sequentially, and systems within
them are ran in parallel.
This can be thought of as a directional acyclic graph where nodes are the
implicit synchronization points between the sets, and edges are the systems and
connect the points in such a way that edges originating in one node all
terminate in the same other node.
Formally:</p>

<p>Since the run time of a system is usually not known at the point of schedule
creation, the schedule has to assume that all systems take equally long.
There is an obvious problem: run times are in no way guaranteed to be equal,
and often independently change during the program's operation.
This almost inevitably produces a situation where some systems in a disjoint
set take longer than the rest, reducing average resource utilization.</p>
<p>Assuming sufficient processing resources (all systems in a
set  can run in parallel at full performance),
the best-case makespan  of 
is the sum of  of the longest-running system in each
disjoint set:</p>

<p>Trivially, if all systems of  are disjoint:</p>

<p>(Naturally, all correct scheduling algorithms should be able to
produce  when applied to such .)</p>
<p>The first idea for alleviating the unknown time problem is to make the
time known.</p>
<p>The scheduler could ask its user to provide hints for the system run time,
be it manually, or via some automated benchmark framework.
However, anticipating all factors that might influence the run time is
impractical for most projects, so this approach would be feasible only for
programs with well-behaved, predictable time coefficients.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the scheduler could collect the run times of systems during
execution, picking up on any changes, and adjusting the schedule to maximize
utilization on the fly (making "static" a misnomer).
Potential volatility of the run time could thwart this approach: if a system
is recorded to take some amount of time to finish during this frame, it's not
guaranteed to not take a vastly different amount next frame, when the
measurement is actually used (in practice, persistently high volatility
between frames is uncommon).</p>
<p>The feasibility of pure  is further undermined by
requirements of certain kinds of ECS, most notably archetypal ECS - a subtype
distinct in the way it organizes data internally.
Without going into specifics: sometimes when the data in such an ECS changes
it also changes which systems are disjoint (this is what the phrase "world's
archetypes have changed" in the examples later in the article refers to).
To address that, the scheduler must partially rebuild its execution graph
whenever such a change occurs.
(Technically, it could also ignore this avenue for parallelization and instead
rely only on statically provable disjointedness; however, that still leaves it
with the unknown time problem.)</p>

<p>The idea of tweaking the schedule on the fly can be taken much further:
a scheduler could retain no static execution graph at all.</p>
<p>Such  would, instead, start
execution of whichever system, then find another one that is disjoint with
the one now running, then another that is disjoint with the two now running...
Once no systems can be started the scheduler simply waits for one of them to
finish; as soon as that happens, it checks again if more systems can now start.</p>
<p>This eliminates the biggest problem stemming from unknown run time of systems:
there are no implicit synchronization points, systems start as soon as
resources are available (access and threads).</p>
<p>However, the order in which systems start matters. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>systems <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code></li>
<li><code>2</code> intersects <code>0</code> and <code>1</code></li>
<li><code>3</code> intersects <code>1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are started first, <code>2</code> can start after both of them finish,
and <code>3</code> can start as soon as <code>0</code> finishes; <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> can run in parallel.</p>
<p>If <code>0</code> and <code>3</code> are started first, <code>1</code> can start after <code>3</code> finishes, and <code>2</code>
can start after <code>0</code> finishes, but <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> can't run in parallel.</p>
<p>This implies that a naive  implementation cannot be said
to always produce an optimal schedule.</p>

<p>An important but not yet elaborated upon property of
any  can be gleaned from its definition: it needs to
work for all .
In practice, these programs often impose additional requirements, which may
narrow the search space (the amount of valid schedules) the algorithm has to
contend with by constraining some of their systems to certain positions in the
schedule.</p>
<p>While these constraints may reduce the running time
of  itself, reducing the search space can potentially
exclude the optimal schedule, which, coupled with the fact that no constraint
can ever increase the search space, means that  is
either increased or not affected by any given constraint.</p>
<h2 id="thread-local-systems"><a href="#thread-local-systems" aria-label="Anchor link for: thread-local-systems">
    
    §§
    
</a>Thread-local systems</h2>
<p>Some systems may require being executed on the thread that defined them, due to
some of the system's internal data being thread-local (in Rust terms, <code>!Send</code>
and/or <code>!Sync</code>, depending on mutability of systems in a given implementation).</p>
<p>This requirement does not forbid parallelization: thread-agnostic systems (or
even systems local to different threads) may still run in parallel on other
threads.</p>
<p>While scheduling thread-local systems, it is only necessary to consider them in
the context of their threads - an obvious constraint.
The makespan of a program containing such systems has an additional lower
bound - it cannot be less than the greatest sum of execution time of systems
local to one thread:</p>

<p>where  is a set of all  local to
thread .</p>

    §§
    
</a>Thread-local data</h2>
<p>Some of the data managed by the ECS may only be accessed by its defining thread
(<code>!Sync</code> for strictly immutable data, otherwise  <code>!Send</code>).
This case is similar to thread-local systems, differing in one key way:
the thread-local data can be shared between several systems.</p>
<p>However, it's impossible to run those …</p></div></div>

The previous post received a lot of great feedback and it seems that people are interested in this topic, so I wanted to continue the series and expand upon another hardware debugging mechanism. For those who are unfamiliar, JTAG is a hardware level debugging mechanism that many embedded CPUs utilize, with this post I hope to explain how to approach JTAG from a reverse engineers perspective and provide some practical examples along the way.</p><h2 id="goals">Goals</h2><p>With this post, I hope to do the following:</p><ol><li>Explain how JTAG works</li><li>Demonstrate how to discover and utilize a JTAG port/interface on an unknown target</li><li>Provide an overview of some of the current OSS tools that can be used to interact with a JTAG interface</li><li>Utilize JTAG to extract firmware and debug a target</li></ol><p>Also, before I give an overview, I wanted to point out a few great resources for learning about JTAG</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/cyphunk/JTAGenum/wiki/Embedded-Analysis#jtag">Cyphunk’s Embedded Analysis Page</a></li><li><a href="https://www.fpga4fun.com/JTAG.html">FPGA4Fun JTAG Overview</a></li><li><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/69ac/07f94832ceb4d2344c9c2d2bc8fc04e68124.pdf?_ga=2.81325524.238759085.1584580795-2049975628.1584580795">Blackbox JTAG Reverse Engineering</a></li></ul><h2 id="jtag-overview">JTAG Overview</h2><p>JTAG is a hardware interface that was developed to assist developers and testers with low level debugging. JTAG was originally developed for testing integrated circuits and more specifically, sampling IO pins on a target under test. This type of debugging interface allows engineers to test connections on PCBs without needing the probe the physical pin itself. The JTAG interface is controlled via the state machine outlined below:</p><p><img data-src="http://openocd.org/doc-release/doxygen/jtag-state-machine-large.png" alt="JTAG State Machine" src="http://openocd.org/doc-release/doxygen/jtag-state-machine-large.png"></p><p>One of the important things to remember about JTAG at this level is that it involves two registers, the instruction register, and the data register. To utilize these registers, the proper states in the above state machine must be entered using the following interface signals:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Line</th><th>Usage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TMS</td><td>This pin is used to navigate and control the JTAG state machine</td></tr><tr><td>TDI</td><td>Input pin, used to write data to the target</td></tr><tr><td>TDO</td><td>Output pin, Used to read data back out from the target</td></tr><tr><td>TCK</td><td>Used to determine when data is sampled for all inputs and outputs</td></tr><tr><td>TRST (Optional)</td><td>This pin can be used to reset the state machine to the starting state</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The state machine is navigated using the TMS and TCK lines, while data is written to or read from via TDI and TDO respectively. TMS is sampled on the rising edge of TCK, meaning that the TMS line must be asserted before TCK is toggled to navigate through the state machine. Data is then shifted into the instruction register (IR) or data register (DR) depending on the state of the JTAG state machine. When an operation is completed (or after the update DR/IR phase) the resulting data can be <em>shifted</em> out of DR by entering the <code>Shift-DR</code> state. With these primitives in place, manufacturers can implement whatever features they wish over JTAG.</p><p>The JTAG standard treats IR and DR as shift registers, and due to this, multiple targets can be daisy-chained together.</p><p><img data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Jtag_chain.svg/654px-Jtag_chain.svg.png" alt="JTAG Daisy Chain" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Jtag_chain.svg/654px-Jtag_chain.svg.png"></p><p>In a nutshell, JTAG defines a state machine that is navigated with a minimum of 4 signals. With this state machine in place, end users can write and read from two shift registers, IR and DR.</p><h3 id="jtag-registers">JTAG Registers</h3><p>JTAG utilizes two main registers, the instruction register, and the data register. The instruction register is used to determine what function the JTAG controller is about to carry out such as a memory read, or memory write for example. The data register is then used as an additional input to the instruction register, for the previous example, they may be used to provide an address to read from or write to. These registers can vary in size based on their function.</p><p>To write to a register one would perform the following steps, we’ll use the IR as an example:</p><ol><li>Enter <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state (TLR) (This can be done by asserting the <code>TMS</code> line and cycling <code>CLK</code> 5 times)</li><li>Enter <code>Select IR Scan</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Capture IR</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Shift IR</code> – This is where we load the data into IR from TDI</li><li>Enter <code>Exit IR</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Update IR</code> state – This stage “latches” the value into IR.</li></ol><p>Following this, if there were no data registers required, the operation would be performed, and the result (if any) would be loaded into the data register to be shifted out. However, many instructions require a data register to be filled out as well before operating. In that case, once the data register is written to and updated, the operation will be performed and the result can be shifted out of the data register.</p><p>Some instructions do not require the DR to be loaded, for example, if we had loaded the <code>IDCODE</code> instruction into IR (1110b), this would load the processor’s IDCODE value into the data register for us to then clock out and read it on <code>TDO</code>. To read the result out of <code>TDO</code>, one would navigate to the <code>Shift-DR</code> state, and clock in 32 bits on <code>TDI</code>, this would cause the data in the data register to be shifted out on the <code>TDO</code> line. See the image below for a visual representation of what would happen if one loaded the IR with the <code>IDCODE</code> instruction</p><p><img data-src="https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean5/images/jtag-architecture-2.png" alt="IDCODE Instruction" src="https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean5/images/jtag-architecture-2.png"></p><p>It’s important to remember, that <code>IR</code> and <code>DR</code> can be thought of as shift registers, meaning that when we update them with new values, the old values are then shifted out on <code>TDO</code>.</p><p>The JTAG standard defines the following instruction registers:</p><ul><li><code>BYPASS</code><ul><li>This instruction connects <code>TDI</code> and <code>TDO</code></li><li>In the <code>Shift DR</code> state, data is transferred from <code>TDI</code> to <code>TDO</code> with a delay of one <code>TCK</code> cycle</li><li>0 is loaded into the data register during the <code>Capture DR</code> state</li><li>This can be used to determine how many devices are in a scan chain</li></ul></li><li><code>IDCODE</code><ul><li>When loaded the Device Code Id Register is selected as the serial path between TDI and TDO</li><li>In the Capture-DR state, the 32-bit device ID code is loaded into this shift section</li><li>In the Shift-DR state, this data is shifted out, least significant bit first</li></ul></li><li><strong>Core JTAG Concepts</strong><ul><li>The state machine is navigated with 4 signals: <code>TCK</code>,<code>TMS</code>,<code>TDO</code> and <code>TDI</code></li><li><code>TDI</code> is used to provide input, <code>TDO</code> is used for output</li><li>Using this state machine data can be shifted into the IR (<code>Shift IR</code>) and the DR (<code>Shift DR</code>)</li><li>The instruction register (<code>IR</code>) can be thought of as a function, and the data register (<code>DR</code>) can be considered the argument to that function</li><li>As data is shifted into <code>DR</code> and <code>IR</code>, the previous contents are shifted out on <code>TDO</code></li><li>Once data is shifted into these registers, an operation can be performed (entirely dependent on host implementation aside from a few reserved instructions)</li><li>Data is <em>read</em> out of the target by shifting it onto <code>TDO</code> from the data register in the <code>Shift DR</code> state.</li></ul></li></ul><p>So now that we have gone over how JTAG works at a low level, we should talk about why we might care about it, and how this interface can grant access to useful features for reverse engineers. One of the most commonly used applications of the JTAG interface is hardware-level debugging (hence the title of this post). This is implemented by the chip manufacturer, and can vary from chip to chip, however, one of the most common implementations of hardware-level debugging for ARM targets is <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0314h/DDI0314H_coresight_components_trm.pdf">ARM’s CoreSight Debug Interface</a>. This is the same implementation that we <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/stm-xbox-jtag/">communicated with over SWD in my last post</a>, only, in this case, the Debug Access Port is communicated with over JTAG. The specifics of the JTAG implementation can be <a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0031/c/IHI0031C_debug_interface_as.pdf">found here</a>. Luckily for us, some excellent OSS tools can be used to communicate with these ports - this post will focus on using OpenOCD.</p><p>OpenOCD takes care of utilizing the JTAG or SWD interface to grant the end-user various primitives that are provided by the debug interface exposed through the CoreSight DAP. The Coresight / DAP architecture is fairly complicated and too much to cover in this (already long) post, so I will potentially save that for another post</p><h2 id="jtag-for-reverse-engineers">JTAG for Reverse Engineers</h2><p>It’s extremely important to have a solid understanding of the protocol fundamentals when approaching something like this from a reverse engineer’s perspective. When reverse engineering hardware (or software) you want to have your ground truth covered since there are always infinite unknowns. These next few sections will go over how we can take advantage of our low-level knowledge of these protocols to assist us on our path to gaining access to hardware level debugging via JTAG. The first thing that we need to do is determine the pinout, and if the pins exposed allow access to the JTAG interface.</p><h3 id="determining-the-pinout">Determining the pinout</h3><p>JTAG signal lines are often grouped together, sometimes (if you’re extremely lucky!) you will see one of the following headers:</p><p><img data-src="https://elinux.org/images/4/48/Ti_arm_jtag.jpg" alt="JTAG Headers" src="https://elinux.org/images/4/48/Ti_arm_jtag.jpg"></p><p>If you find something like this however, it may not have the exact signal groupings, so we will discuss how to determine a pinout if one assumes it’s used for JTAG.</p><p>When reverse engineering something like this, you want to start with what you know. Since we know that most manufacturers at <em>least</em> implement <code>IDCODE</code> and <code>BYPASS</code> let’s talk about how we can take advantage of those two instructions.</p><p>If you have identified what you believe to be a potential JTAG header or pinout, but do not know the pins, we can use the behavior of these two registers to determine the pinout.</p><p>Since the <code>IDCODE</code> register is typically loaded as the default IR, one can test an assumed pinout by doing the following:</p><ol><li>Assign roles to potential output pins (TMS, TCK, etc)</li><li>Enter the <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state</li><li>Enter the <code>Select DR Scan</code>, <code>Capture DR</code>, <code>Shift DR</code></li><li>Clock 32 values on <code>TDI</code> and monitor <code>TDO</code> for a valid <code>IDCODE</code> value</li><li>Check the <code>IDCODE</code> value that you shifted out if it looks valid congratulations! Otherwise, reassign pins and repeat!</li></ol><p>In addition to taking advantage of the fact that the <code>IDCODE</code> register is often loaded into the IR by default, we can also utilize the fact that both the IR and DR behave as shift registers, so if we assume a common register length (32 bits often works) we can attempt to brute force the pinout by doing the following:</p><ol><li>Assign roles to potential output pins (TMS, TCK,etc)</li><li>Using these assumed values, enter the <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state</li><li>Enter the <code>Shift IR</code> state</li><li>Shift in a unique 32-bit value on <code>TDI</code></li><li>Continue to shift 1’s on <code>TDI</code> while monitoring for your unique pattern on TDO (be sure to do this as lease 32 times!).</li><li>If the pattern is discovered, congratulations! Otherwise, …</li></ol></div></div>

		<div><p>I went into my office yesterday for the first time in a few months to pick some stuff up. We got notified
a couple of days ago to get any personal property out of the office before Thanksgiving or else it'd be
thrown out, so I guess we're moving out of the office<sup id="fnref:moving-out"><a href="#fn:moving-out">1</a></sup>. It was a pretty eerie place to be; even now, 8
months later, most people haven't been back and it kind of looks like the entire office was abducted by aliens in
early March.</p>

<p>Despite how weird it is, I still miss working out of the office.</p>

<p>I miss having a clean delineation between "work" and "home".</p>
<p>I miss having copious desk space and a big monitor<sup id="fnref:house"><a href="#fn:house">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I miss the 48" TVs on the wall showing Grafana dashboards with key metrics so there was always ambient knowledge of
what was going on with the product.</p>
<p>I miss having meetings in conference rooms where you can see other people and have a giant whiteboard to sketch on.</p>
<p>I miss casual collaboration. Video chat is a poor substitute and Slack is a deeply irritating tool that combines the
worst aspects of synchronous and asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>I miss productivity! Our engineering productivity has fallen through the floor since COVID despite everyone
working longer and harder; I fundamentally do not think remote teams can <em>ever</em> be as productive as in-person teams.</p>
<p>I miss having my employer pay for electricity and heat and fast symmetric multi-gigabit Internet access instead of
shifting those costs to me.</p>
<p>I miss having a plethora of convenient and delicious options for take-out lunch! I miss the gyros and french fries

<p>I miss the succession of friendly baristas at our <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hermanos-coffee-juice-san-francisco">favorite coffee shop</a> who always knew our orders and put up with our banter.</p>
<p>I miss occasional after-work drinks at the <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/4/25/18516128/skydeck-spirits-in-the-sky-rooftop-bar-san-francisco">sky bar</a> with the $18 well drinks that we always convinced management to pay for.</p>
<p>Hell, I miss <a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> in all its loud and smelly glory.</p>
<p>Look, I know, it's not all bad. It's a lot easier taking care of a baby while working from home than it would be if
I were commuting 45 minutes each way every day. I'm spending a lot less money on food and coffee and BART. And I'm
not arguing that we should be in the office now; not a single one of those things I listed above is worth the health
risk of jamming 150 people<sup id="fnref:deniers"><a href="#fn:deniers">3</a></sup> into an open-plan office with a quasi-functional ventilation
system<sup id="fnref:ventilation"><a href="#fn:ventilation">4</a></sup>. But I
really hope that office-work isn't a permanent victim of this pandemic, that all the companies pushing for
permanent WFH to save a few bucks on rent reconsider their stances, and that there comes a time when I can go back to
work again.</p>

<p>Anonymous Sum Types are one of those Rust features that doesn't exist yet and you either are very familiar with the idea and can't wait for the day an RFC gets approved or... you've never heard of it and think the name sounds as gibberish. Luckily in my experience the transition from the latter to the former is a smooth one!</p>

<h2>What's an Anonymous Sum Type?</h2>
<p>Let's break it down word for word. (If you're already familiar, feel free to skip this)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anonymity, the programming term, refers to a variant of a construct which bears no name. For example, in Javascript you have this little guy:</p>

<p>And, for those who are neither familiar with javascript nor anonymous functions as a whole, you might be confused about what the purpose of a function with no name to call it with! However a function in javascript is an object, which means the above is an expression. So any API which takes a function as a parameter can now take an anonymous function. So you can do the following:</p>

<p>And if you're familiar with Rust, you'll realize Rust has a very similar construct, closures!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sum Types</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure if you're reading this you're likely familiar with both a sum (as most programmers are familiar with algebra) and a type, but what exactly is a sum type? (also known as a "tagged union" or "discriminated union" or "tagged variant" and probably one or two other things I'm sure)</p>
<p>You might have even used a sum type without being familiar with the overly academic nomenclature of "sum type", let's take at a really common use case in Rust for sum types and, "coincidentally", the topic of this blog post: error handling.</p>
<p>In Rust error handling it has a strong emphasis on returning errors, as opposed to many languages which reach for exceptions. Here is how this difference looks in <em>reality</em>:</p>


<p>In the Java/exceptions version, the addition of error handling does not affect the return type. However, in Rust, you return one of the two types: either <code>CsvFile</code> or <code>io::Error</code>. So, if you think about the actual type you are returning, <code>Result&lt;CsvFile, io::Error&gt;</code> is a type representing the combination of the two types. (Spoiler: this is what a sum type is, more on that in a second)</p>
<p>Let's try doing something similar by hand in Rust:</p>

<p>Now, at risk of over-explaining the concept, let's represent this in a different manner. A type is merely a set of values that allows us to constrain the values we have to work with. Let's try representing <code>bool</code> and <code>u32</code> as sets:</p>
<pre><code>bool = { true, false }
u32 = { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , (2^32) - 3, (2^32) - 2, (2^32) - 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>that means we can represent our type <code>BoolOrU32</code> as the union of the set <code>bool</code> and the set <code>u32</code>:</p>
<pre><code>BoolOrU32 = bool ∪ u32 = { true, false, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , (2^32) - 3, (2^32) - 2, (2^32) - 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>Now one thing to consider is that with our <code>BoolOrU32</code> enum, we are still storing the information which tells us if it is a <code>bool</code> or a <code>u32</code>. This is what differentiates a sum type from a C-styled union. This concept of storing which variant the enum is is the "tagged" part of the other name for sum types, "tagged unions".</p>
<p>To put that all together, <strong>an anonymous sum type is an unnamed combination of types</strong>.</p>
<h2>Error Handling Woes</h2>
<p>Taking a look back at our previous example there's a bit of a problem:</p>
<pre><code>warning: this is super limiting
  --&gt; ~/dev/csv-parser/src/lib.rs
   |
33 | fn parse_csv(path: &amp;Path) -&gt; Result&lt;CsvFile, io::Error&gt;;
   |                                              ^^^^^^^^^ this sucks
   |
   = help: consider using one of the following libraries:
           thiserror
           eyre
           snafu
</code></pre>
<p>While some errors from parsing a file might be I/O related (for example if the file doesn't exist), but some are parsing related errors! We could use <code>io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, my_error_here)</code> but that's rather verbose to construct, hacky, and it's even somehow an order worse to extract our error type from the <code>io::Error</code>!</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is to hand roll an <code>enum</code> to make a sum type for your error type. This is a really great way of going about things, and is my goto for error handling! It's a great fit for libraries as it allows library consumers to handle only certain errors, or specify error handling by type. It's not very helpful to handle a missing file and an invalid webpage certificate the same way!</p>
<p>However... this introduces a new problem. Internally, you often want granularity as far as your error types. It allows people new to the codebase to see exactly which 2-3 errors a function could return, it allows you to use exhaustive matching to catch more bugs at compile time, etc. However, it's not very appealing to make a new enum for every new combination of errors a function produces. I mean how do you even get past the gruelling process of naming such a type? <code>IoOrParseError</code> isn't exactly what I call a lovely name...</p>
<h2>A Solution! (Sort of)</h2>
<p>Not wanting to name a sum type? That sounds like a job for... anonymous sum types! This is, admittedly, one of the features I've wanted since I first fell in love with Rust's enums being sum types (in a systems programming language? scandelous!). However, last I checked, bumping every Sum Type RFC with an alt got me nowhere! (Yes, for anyone who is paying attention, I <em>will</em> recycle the exact same joke as from my RustConf talk)</p>
<p>It's time to take matters into my own hands. Introducing <code>some-error</code>!</p>

<p>The idea is simple: use an attribute macro to allow for a very minimal/focused version of anonymous sum types specifically aimed at use in error handling. To use it you just slap <code>#[some_error]</code> on your function, set the return type as <code>Result&lt;T, E1 + E2 + ...&gt;</code> and you're good to go! You can even use <code>?</code> for any of the included error types.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wait, what's the big idea with this hand-wavey black magic nonsense!"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Man Behind The Curtain</h2>
<h3>The Syntax</h3>
<p>In Rust, you can return trait objects, for example:</p>

<p>Where <code>dyn Any + Send + Sync</code> can be any object which can be any type that implements <code>Any</code>, <code>Send</code>, and <code>Sync</code>, the same single function can even return any number of types, so long as all of those types implement <code>Any + Send + Sync</code>. Tiny bit of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/trait-system/dyn-trait-for-trait-objects.html">Rust history</a>, but before Rust 2018, the syntax for this didn't include <code>dyn</code>:</p>

<p>And since this still parses in spite of being deprecated, that means we can use it for our own nefarious macro purposes! (<del>until it is inevitably removed</del>)</p>
<h3>The Pattern Matching</h3>
<p>Unlike the function itself, matching on the anonymous sum type requires no macro. That means this time around we can't cheat! Everything must be above board or <code>rustc</code> will give me a slap on the wrist. Although, I can't quite say I got out of the macro hackery unscathed, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79148"><code>rustc</code> punished me with a bit of ICE for my crimes</a>.</p>
<p>This time, I abuse a lesser-known <a href="https://jam1.re/img/rust-fact.png">Rust fact</a> that Rust functions and modules exist in different scopes, allowing you to make them overlapping:</p>

<p>And, similarly to traits and derive macros, this allows you to import both at once:</p>

<p>which gives the illusion that the function can have associated constants, types, functions, etc.</p>
<h3>Making <code>?</code> "Just Work"</h3>
<p>This part is rather easy! One really wonderful feature of Rust is that the <code>?</code> operator will automatically coerce from <code>Result&lt;T, E1&gt;</code> to <code>Result&lt;T, E2&gt;</code>, given <code>E2: From&lt;E1&gt;</code>. Meaning all we have to do is generate some trivial <code>From</code> implementations and voila! Now any part of the sum type can be returned using <code>?</code>.</p>
<h3>The Variants</h3>
<p>One problem that occurred while making this is that, unlike a normal enum, the variants can't really have identifiers as names. Since it's a common pattern in Rust to refer to errors in the form of <code>module::Error</code> (such as <code>io::Error</code> or <code>fmt::Error</code>), the variants need to be paths (as I don't really consider any form of normalization such as <code>IoError</code> to really be an appealing solution).</p>
<p>So how can we go about this? Since we're already using a macro anyways, we might as well make the most of it! Let's just generate modules to emulate the paths and then re-export the individual variants of our error type!</p>

<h2>Wait What Do You Mean "Sort of" a Solution?</h2>
<p>Welllllllllllllll. While I am rather happy with how far I was capable of pushing what is possible, I can't say whether or not I actually like it. I haven't been able to extensively test it as I started writing the library a day before writing this. Perhaps this results in a lot of problems! Maybe those problems are all solvable by language-level support of anonymous sum types. Maybe someone else needs to "yes and" this idea before it is actually truely useful. I can't say!</p>
<p>My goal here was not to make <strong>The</strong> error handling library, but rather to explore a new design idea. And possibly to give people something to play with to find sharp edges to motivate a language-level implementation.</p>
<p>You're free to use some-error in your projects, and I will certainly maintain it to the best of my ability, but I guess what I'm trying to say is please don't flame me on reddit just because this library isn't going in anyone's million LOC codebase.</p>

November 21, 2020 | https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>In 2015, I gave a talk in which I called <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/skade/tex-the-ultimate-yakshave">Donald Knuth the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves</a>. The reason is that Donald Knuth achieved the most perfect and long-running yak shave: TeX.</p>
<p>I figured this is worth repeating.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-achieve-the-ultimate-yak-shave">How to achieve the ultimate Yak Shave</h2>
<p>The ultimate yak shave is the combination of improbable circumstance, the privilege to be able to shave at your hearts will and the will to follow things through to the end. Here’s the way it was achieved with TeX. The recount is purely mine, inaccurate and obviously there for fun. I’ll avoid the most boring facts that everyone always tells, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">why Knuth’s checks have their own Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>So, let’s get things started.</p>
<h2 id="the-pre-shave">The Pre-Shave</h2>
<p>TeX was invented to typeset a book. No plural. It was invented to typeset the second edition of “The Art of Computer Programming”. The second edition had to be typeset again, as “hot type” typesetting, which was used for the first edition, was not available anymore. Being unimpressed by the available options, Knuth decided to write his own system, which later ended up as TeX.</p>
<p>But “The Art of Computer Programming” is an impressive book in its own right: it is still unfinished, currently spanning 3.5 volumes (yes, the fourth is unfinished, but the first chapters are released). It was called a book of the century by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080820030403/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science">American scientist writers</a>.</p>
<p>Yak shave -2: Write a book of the century</p>
<p>Digging deeper into TAOCP, it already shows the works of a yak shaver destined for greater things. All programs in this book refer to a common assembly language: MIX. Which was invented for the book.</p>
<p>Yak shave -1: Invent your own computer for illustration purposes</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The first version of TeX was implemented using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIL_(programming_language)">SAIL</a> programming language. It was later replaced by WEB. What’s WEB? It’s a programming language, invented by… You’ll have guessed it by now, Donald Knuth. It transpiles to PASCAL. Knuth transpiled the WEB before it was cool.</p>
<p>Yak shave 1: Somewhere along the road, implement your own programming language…</p>
<p>WEB is a special language: in WEB, any bare text is just text. It’s interleaved with marked pieces of code, which are later used for the program code. The documentation can be run through a special program to produce… a TeX file. The concept is called “literate programming” and was introduced by… Donald Knuth.</p>
<p>Yak shave 2: Invent your own programming paradigm for it</p>
<p>But, what does TeX do? Mainly, it does text layout and a couple of other things. Knuth being known for research on algorithms couldn’t do without coming up with his own algorithm, later published together with Michael Plass. What does the algorithm do? It finds a visually pleasing way to lay out a paragraph on a page without making line breaks look jarring (for example by adjusting the “glue”, the whitespace between words). Here’s a <a href="https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs490/2015W2/lectures/Knuth.pdf">nice explanation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s still considered good and has a huge factor in the recognisable look of TeX documents.</p>
<p>Yak shave 3: Invent your own layout algorithm for it</p>
<p>Which brings us to the next problem: <em>what</em> does this thing lay out? Generically speaking: objects and clusters of objects of varying sizes. Interestingly, that’s what TeX deals with, it has no concept of a character other then dimensions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these are usually characters and characters are provided by fonts. Fonts must usually be licensed at a fee and free fonts weren’t so available in the 70s.</p>
<p>Another very recognisable feature of TeX documents that they are often set in a font called “Computer Modern”.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make this whole thing a bit more thrilling, so I will let you guess who created that one.</p>
<p>Yak shave 4: Design a font</p>
<p>Fonts need to be authored. Usually, they are described in some vector description, often Bézier curves. This is fairly standard and not an innovation of Knuth. <em>But</em>, he wrote a description language for that, along with an interpreter to turn this descriptions into proper font files. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont">METAFONT</a>. It’s not strictly part of TeX, it’s just that the Yak happened to stand close.</p>
<p>Yak shave 5: Write an authoring tool for fonts</p>
<p>As a side-note, METAFONT was later evolved into METAPOST for generic vector drawings, which has the one feature I still miss from many modern graphics description languages: the ability to describe an (addressable) point as the intersection between two other primitives.</p>
<p>Another side-note: both TeX and METAFONT still see releases, at a slow pace. TeX is currently at version 3.14159265, METAFONT at 2.7182818. Yep, TeX is slowly converging towards pi, while METAFONT towards e. Take that, semantic versioning advocates!</p>
<p>Yak shave 6: Come up with your own versioning scheme<br>
Yak shave 7: Avoid adoption of it for greater good</p>
<p>We’re not done yet. We can layout text (and other things), but where do we convert it to? Now, everyone knows the horror printers invoke, so no one wants to deal with those directly. Classic TeX instead converts things to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format">DVI</a>, the “device independent” format. I don’t know many details about it, except what’s on the wiki page, which feels the need to specifically point out that “DVI is not a document encryption format”. It is again a stack-based language (in contrast to PostScript not turing complete), which can then be interpreted through a driver, which would then send that to whatever target (a printer, PDF or such). It was designed by…</p>
<p>David R. Fuchs, Knuth just wrote the implementation.</p>
<p>Yak shave 8: Implement a custom language for printable documents</p>
<p>Note that I haven’t mentioned that TeX is an… interesting… language by itself, but I don’t consider that a yak shave, this was just the implementation.</p>
<p>That makes most of the initial implementation complete. Which means, in orderly fashion, you should give matters in the hand of the community.</p>

<p>Since the release of TeX, the community has been busy working on using it as a platform. If you ever downloaded the full TeX distribution, please bear in mind that you are downloading the amassed work of over 40 years, to make sure that each and every TeX document ever written builds. We’re talking about documents here.</p>
<p>But mostly, two big projects sprung out of that. The first is LaTeX by Leslie Lamport. Lamport is a very productive researcher, famous for research in formal methods through TLA+ and also known laying groundwork for many distributed algorithms. LaTeX is based on the idea of seperating presentation and content. It is based around the idea of document classes, which then describe the way a certain document is layed out. Think Markdown, just much more complex. The second is ConTeXt, which is far more focused on fine grained layout control.</p>
<p>Both share a common property:</p>
<p>Community yak shave 1: Create not one, but two programs that are very ungoogleable… Before Google is invented.</p>
<p>Being active in a language that has lingo built around “Rust”, “Cargo” and “manifests”, I feel right at home.</p>
<p>Now, the community also wants to evolve TeX: a lot has changed over the years in technology, so, for example, you’d like to use modern font formats, directly write to modern output formats or use this new UTF-8 thingy. For that, there are specialised TeX interpreters, such as <code>pdf(la)tex</code>, <code>lua(la)tex</code> and <code>xe(la)tex</code>. There’s a problem here: you are not allowed to change TeX and distribute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#License">it under that name</a>. The thinking here is that if you have a <code>tex</code> binary, you can compile any valid TeX from the past and from the future.</p>
<p>The first issue on that road is that WEB isn’t really a popular programming language, neither is PASCAL and running it on modern systems is a bit of a pain. Which means…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 2: Transpile WEB to C and work from there</p>
<p>This is just the start of a great endeavour…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 3: Build a lot of tooling around that</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The Moral of the Story</h2>
<p>Whenever you feel like “can’t we just replace this whole thing, it can’t be so hard” when handling TeX, don’t forget how many years of work and especially knowledge were poured into that system. Typesetting isn’t the <em>most</em> popular knowledge around programmers. Especially see it in the context of the space it is in: they can’t remove legacy. Ever. That would break documents.</p>
<p>TeX is also not a programming language. It might resemble one, but mostly, it should be approached as a typesetting system first. A lot of its confusing lingo gets much better then. It’s not programming lingo.</p>
<p>By approaching TeX with an understanding for its history, a lot of things can be learned from it. And yes, a replacement would be great, but it would take ages.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope I thoroughly convinced you why Donald Knuth is the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves.</p>

<p>This comes out of a enjoyable discussion with <a href="https://lambdaisland.com/">Arne from Lambda Island</a>, who listened and said “you should totally turn this into a talk”.</p>

<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

</code></pre></div><p>Besides basic OCaml syntaxes[1], interesting bits in the example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can force OCaml to always inline a function via adding an attribute <code>[@inline]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent">
				<p>This post concludes my introduction to the chrono extension in C++20. Today I present the time-zones functionality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage.png" alt="TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage" width="650" height="278"></p>
<p>I should have written, today I mainly present the time-zones functionality in C++20. Before I write about the time-zones in C++20, I want to present the online resource <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes </a>from Howard Hinnant, which has about 40 examples of the new chrono functionality. Presumably, the chrono extension in C++20 is not easy to get; therefore it's quite important to have so many examples. You should use these examples as a starting point for further experiments and, therefore, sharpen your understanding. You can also add your recipes.</p>
<p>To get an idea of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes</a> I want to present a program for<a href="https://github.com/rbock"> Roland Bock</a> that calculates ordinal dates.</p>
<h2 id="h1-calculating-ordinal-dates">Calculating Ordinal Dates</h2>
<p>"<em>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_date" rel="nofollow">ordinal date</a> consists of a year and a day of year (1st of January being day 1, 31st of December being day 365 or day 366). The year can be obtained directly from year_month_day. And calculating the day is wonderfully easy. In the code below we make us of the fact that year_month_day can deal with invalid dates like the 0th of January</em>:" (Roland Bock)</p>
<p>I added the necessary headers to Roland's program.</p>
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div>
<pre><span>// ordinalDate.cpp</span>

<span>#include "date.h"</span>
<span>#include &lt;iomanip&gt;</span>
<span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>()
{
   <span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> date;

   <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> ymd <span>=</span> year_month_day{daypoint};         
   
   <span>// calculating the year and the day of the year</span>
   <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> year <span>=</span> ymd.year();
   <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> year_day <span>=</span> daypoint <span>-</span> sys_days{year<span>/</span>January<span>/</span><span>0</span>}; <span>// (2)</span> 
                                                              <span>// (3)</span>
   std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> year <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'-'</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>setfill(<span>'0'</span>) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>setw(<span>3</span>) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> year_day.count() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
   
   <span>// inverse calculation and check</span>
   assert(ymd <span>==</span> year_month_day{sys_days{year<span>/</span>January<span>/</span><span>0</span>} <span>+</span> year_day});
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>I want to add a few remarks to the program. Line (1) truncates the current time point. The value is used in the following line to initialize a calendar date. Line (2) calculates the time duration between the two time points. Both time points have the resolution day. Finally, <code>year_day.count()</code> in line (3) returns the time duration in days.<img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/ordinalDate2.png" alt="ordinalDate2" width="350" height="181"></p>
<p>My following examples to time-zones are also inspired by the already mentioned web resource <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h2-times-zones">Times-Zones</h2>
<p>First of all, a time-zone is a region and its full history of the date such as daylight saving time or leap seconds. The time-zone library in C++20 is a complete parser of the<a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones"> IANA timezone database</a>. The following table should give you a first idea of the new functionality.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/timeZone.png" alt="timeZone" width="600" height="277"></p>
<p>I use in my examples the function <code>std::chrono::zones_time</code> which is essentially a time-zone combined with a time point.</p>
<p>Before I show you two examples I want to make a short remark. To compile a program using the time-zone library, you have to compile the<code> tz.cpp</code> file and link against the <code>curl</code> library. The curl library is necessary to get the current <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones"> IANA timezone database</a>. The following command line for g++ should give you the idea:</p>
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div>
<pre>g<span>++</span> localTime.cpp <span>-</span>I <span>&lt;</span>Path to data<span>/</span>tz.h<span>&gt;</span> tz.cpp <span>-</span>std<span>=</span>c<span>++</span><span>17</span> <span>-</span>lcurl <span>-</span>o localTime
</pre>

<p>My first program is straightforward. It displays the UTC time and the local time.</p>
<h3 id="h2-1-utc-time-and-local-time">UTC Time and Local Time</h3>
<p>The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"> UTC time or Coordinated Univeral Time</a> is the primary time standard worldwide. A computer uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a> which is a very close approximation of UTC. The UNIX time is the number of seconds since the Unix epoch. The Unix epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.</p>
<p><code></code><code>std::chrono::system_clock::now()</code> in line (1) returns in the following program<code> localTime.cpp </code> the Unix time.<code><br></code></p>

<p>I have not to add too much to the program. The code block beginning with line (1) gets the current time point, truncates it to seconds, and displays it. The call<code> date::make_zoned</code> creates a <code>std::chrono::zoned_time localTime. T</code>he following call<code> localTime.get_local_time() </code>returns the stored time point as a local time. This time point is also truncated to seconds. <code>localTime</code> (line 3) can also be used to get information about the time-zone. In this case, I'm interested in the offset to the UTC time.</p>

<p>My last program answers a crucial question when I teach in a different time-zone: When should I start my online class?</p>
<h3 id="h2-2-various-time-zones-for-online-classes">Various Time-Zones for Online Classes</h3>
<p>The program <code>onlineClass.cpp</code> answers the following question: How late is it in given time-zones, when I start an online class at the <code>7h, 13h,</code> or <code>17h</code> local time (Germany)?</p>
<p>The online class should start on the 1st of February 2021 and should take 4 hours. Because of the daylight saving time, the calendar date is essential to get the correct answer.</p>

<p>Before I dive into the functions<code> getMinutes</code> (line 1) and <code>printStartEndTimes</code> (line 2), let me say a view words about the <code>main</code> function. The <code>main</code> function defines the day of the class, the duration of the class, and all time-zones. Finally, the range-based for-loop (line 3) iterates through all potential starting points for an online class. Thanks to the function <code>printStartEndTimes</code> (line 2) all necessary information is displayed.</p>
<p>The few lines beginning with line (4) calculate the<code> startDate</code> and <code>endDate</code> of my training by adding the start time and the duration of the class to the calendar date. Both values are displayed with the help of the function <code>getMinutes</code> (line 1). <code>date<span>::</span>floor<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>chrono<span>::</span>minutes<span>&gt;</span>(zonedTime.get_local_time())</code> gets the stored time point out of the<code> std::chrono::zoned_time</code> and truncates the value to the minute resolution. To properly align the output of the program, line (5) <code> </code><code></code>determines the size of the longest of all time-zone names. Line (6) iterates through all time-zones and displays the name of the time-zone, and the beginning and end of each online-class. A few calendar dates even cross the day boundaries.<img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/onlineClass.png" alt="onlineClass" width="600" height="760"></p>
<p>There is more to write about the extended chrono library. For example, C++20 offers new clocks such as<code> std::chrono::utc_clock</code> that include leap seconds, or the<code> std::chrono::tai_clock</code> that represents the International Atomic Time (TAI). Additional, thanks to the new formatting library in C++20, time durations can be nicely formatted. This feature is not available so far. If you want to study the formating rules for time durations, here are they: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/system_clock/formatter#Format_specification">std::formatter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h3-what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>If you want to compare signed and unsigned integrals, you may have a lot of fun. This fun ends with C++20.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskiSieve.html">Sierpinski triangle</a> is a famous mathematical figure which presents an interesting computer science problem: how to go about generating it. In this article I'll explain one method of generating the Sierpinski triangle recursively, with an implementation written in Vanilla JavaScript using HTML5 canvas. I'll also explain how to you'd go about downloading the contents of an HTML5 Canvas element as a PNG.</p>
<p>First, here's what the Sierpinski triangle looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/sierpinski-triangle.jpg" alt="The Sierpinski Triangle"></p>
<h2>What is the Sierpinski Triangle?</h2>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle is a Fractal, Making it Naturally Recursive</h3>
<p>One initial thing to notice about the Sierpinski triangle is that every triangle is composed of smaller, identical triangles. Those triangles are also made up of even smaller, identical triangles, which are also made up of more triangles, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/fractal.jpg" alt="Sierpinski Triangle Fractal"></p>
<p>This property in which the Sierpinski triangle is made up of identical, scaled-down copies of itself makes it a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Fractal.html">fractal</a> in mathematics. Fractals are shapes that are made up of scaled down copies of themselves. The Sierpinski triangle is actually arguably one of the most famous fractals that exist, along with <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagorasTree.html">Pythagoras Trees</a>, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html">the Mandelbrot set</a>, and more.</p>
<p>The fact that fractals are made up of copies of themselves makes them naturally recursive, and it tends to be simpler to programmatically generate fractals recursively as supposed to using an iterative approach.</p>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle Only Uses Equilateral Triangles</h3>
<p>Next, notice how the Sierpinski triangle is made up of a single shape: the equilateral triangle. This is not a coincidence, and it is in fact one of the reasons the Sierpinski triangle is a notable mathematical figure.</p>
<p>The Sierpinski triangle takes advantage of a property of equilateral triangles: that they are one of the only shapes that can be made up solely by scaled down versions of itself, where a large equilateral triangle can be made by tesselating four equally smaller equilateral triangles. This makes them uniquely positioned to be the centerpiece of simple fractals, since it is intuitive to encompass smaller copies of an equilateral triangle inside a larger one.</p>
<p>This also makes it possible for fractals based on equilateral triangles, like the Sierpinski triangle, to be composed of only one shape. Other polygon-based fractals that don't use equilateral triangles often include several different shapes.</p>
<h2>Generating the Sierpinski Triangle in JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas</h2>
<h3>Setting Up the HTML and Canvas Element</h3>
<p>Let's start by setting up the <code>canvas</code> element and basic HTML markup:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sierpinski Triangle&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="canvas" width="1000" height="1000"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;

    &lt;!-- JavaScript Code Here --&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note that the width and height variables in the canvas represent the inner dimensions of the canvas, not necessarily its size on the page. This means it can be resized in the future to fit different screen sizes, while maintaining its inner dimensions of 1000px by 1000px.</p>
<h3>Creating Equilateral Triangles on the Canvas in JavaScript</h3>
<p>Since equilateral triangles are the only shape used in the Sierpinski triangle, it makes sense to write a utility function to draw a given equilateral triangle on the canvas at a specified position and of a specified size.</p>
<p>This function will take in two arguments: the position of the bottom left vertex on the triangle (<code>pos</code>), and the length of the sides of the triangle (<code>sidelen</code>).</p>
<p>To create polygons in HTML5 canvas, there are several functions to move to positions on the canvas, draw a path around an area of the canvas, and fill in that area. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>context.beginPath()</code> and <code>context.closePath()</code> — create and close a path; commonly used with <code>context.fill()</code> after closing the path</li>
<li><code>context.moveTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas.</li>
<li><code>context.lineTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas while drawing a line from the current position.</li>
<li><code>context.fill()</code> — fill the most recent canvas path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a triangle simply means identifying the positions of the three vertices, drawing a path around those vertices, and filling the drawn area with a color. Identifying the positions of the vertices is pretty intuitive. Below is a visual showing the positions of the vertices. Note that the height of an equilateral triangle is mathematically equal to as <code>sin(Pi/3) * sidelen</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/equilateral-triangle.jpg" alt="Equilateral Triangle Vertex Positions"></p>
<p>With the positions of the vertices done, here's what the function to create an equilateral triangle on the canvas would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const c = document.getElementById("canvas");
const ctx = c.getContext("2d"); // context variable is used to draw on a 2D plane

const createTriangle = (pos, sidelen) =&gt; {
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(...pos); // go to the left vertex

  // note that (0,0) in canvas is the top left, so 'up' on the vertical component would use substraction.
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen / 2, pos[1] - sidelen * Math.sin(Math.PI/3)); // draw line from left vertex to top vertex
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen, pos[1]); // draw line from top vertex to right vertex
  ctx.lineTo(...pos); // draw line from right vertex back to left vertex
  ctx.closePath();
  ctx.fill(); // fill triangle
};</code></pre>
<h3>Implementing an Algorithm to Generate the Sierpinski Triangle</h3>
<p>Now that the canvas and HTML has been set up and the <code>createTriangle</code> utility function has been written, we can start implementing an algorithm to generate the Sierpinski triangle.</p>
<p>Since fractals are naturally recursive, we'll use a recursive approach to generate the entire triangle.</p>
<p>First, recall that every triangle in the Sierpinski triangle is made up of three smaller triangles, one on the left, another on the right, and a final one on the top. Each smaller triangle is a copy of the outer triangle, the Sierpinski triangle. So, simply create a smaller Sierpinski triangle inside of each of the three triangles, and then more smaller Sierpinski triangles inside of those, and so on. Technically, the Sierpinski triangle repeats forever, but for visualizations like this, a stopping point should be defined when there have been enough repeats that the smallest triangles are hard to make out. At this point, filling in the smallest triangles acts as an effective substitution of repeating further.</p>
<p>To create this stopping condition, a variable called <code>depth</code> can be used. <code>depth</code> would represent the amount of times the program should continue repeating the fractal. <code>depth</code> should start at a certain value and decrease for every repeat, and every smaller Sierpinski triangle created. Once <code>depth</code> reaches zero (the base case), the program would stop and fill in the three triangles instead of continuing to repeat the fractal.</p>
<p>To create this functionality, let's create a function called <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> which takes the position of the Sierpinski triangle to generate, its side length, and the depth. The function should identify the positions of the three inner triangles, draw them if depth is equal to zero, or call <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> on the three inner triangles if the depth is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const createSierpinskiTriangle = (pos, sidelen, depth) =&gt; {
  const innerTriangleSidelen = sidelen / 2; // side length of inner triangles is half the side length of the outer triangle
  const innerTrianglesPositions = [
    pos,
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen, pos[1] ],
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen / 2, pos[1] - Math.sin(Math.PI/3) * innerTriangleSidelen ]
  ]; // these positions are the same as what was used in the createTriangle function
  if(depth == 0) {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen);
    });
  } else {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createSierpinskiTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen, depth - 1);
    });
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>To call the function, draw the Sierpinski triangle at the bottom left of the canvas (<code>(0, 1000)</code>) with a side length of <code>1000</code>px (the width of the canvas) and a depth of <code>5</code>.</p>
<pre><code>createSierpinskiTriangle([0, 1000], 1000, 5);</code></pre>
<p>Here's the result:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/sierpinski-triangle.jpg" alt="Recursive Method Result"></p>
<p>Try increasing the depth, and you should see that the triangle gets more and more detailed. Increasing the depth by one will result in three times the amount of total triangles to be drawn, so very high depths like 20 might not be performant since the canvas would have to draw 3^20 (~3.5 billion) triangles.</p>
<h3>Downloading the Generated Triangle From the Canvas as a PNG</h3>
<p>Now that we've generated the triangle recursively, one thing you may want to do is download the generated Sierpinski triangle as an image on your computer. Luckily, this is very simple to do in HTML5 Canvas.</p>
<p>First, the canvas must be converted to a data URL. If you're not familiar with data URLs, here's a simple definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A data URL is a URL scheme that allows data and files (images, audio files, etc.) to be respresented in a single URL containing all of the data. For example, if one wanted to include an image on a website, you would add the image to the web server and link to it in the HTML. With data URLs, the data URL contains the contents of the entire file, so it can simply be put into the HTML directly. This is useful in canvas because we want to export the image without it having a specific public URL, and data URLs allow that to be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contents of the <code>canvas</code> element can be converted to a data URL with the <code>.toDataURL</code> method.</p>
<p>Next, let's download the data URL into the user's machine. In HTML, downloading a file is done by clicking a link and specifying the <code>download</code> attribute. For example, here's how someone would download an image as <code>myimage.png</code> when the user clicks a link: <code>&lt;a href="image.png" download="myimage.png"&gt;download!&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Downloading a file through JavaScript is as simple as creating a link element with the specified <code>href</code> and <code>download</code> attributes, and artificially clicking on it.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const downloadCanvasContents = () =&gt; {
  const link = …</code></pre></div></div>

</p>
<p>RubyConf 2020</p>
</div>
<p>Due to COVID-19, and a rough year for humanity in general, I was looking forward to hanging out with
fellow Rubyists even if virtual. The team behind managing and hosting the event did an excellent job
in making it a fun and welcoming experience. Kudos!</p>
<p>I’ve been enjoying the virtual format for conferences this year and hoping this becomes more of a
mainstay for future conferences. During Slack conversations, people had mentioned taking a hybrid
approach where people could attend in person but there would also be a way, for people who couldn’t
travel, to also experience the joy of Ruby remotely. I like this idea a lot.</p>
<p>If I had one complaint, I would have wished the service for hosting the event was an all-in-one
platform. Instead, you had to jump between multiple services:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/">Crowdcast</a> - Used for streaming both live and pre-recorded
presentations. I do have to say I enjoyed being able to rewatch parts of a presentation after it
was over since it only took a few minutes to become available. Even better, you could jump over to
a track you didn’t attend and catch up on it at double speed. ⚡️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> - No complaints here. Although, it would have been nice to have the
Slack experience embedded within Crowdcast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.alchemists.io/articles/avoid_zoom">Zoom</a> - Necessary for some of the workshops and sponsored events. This
was unfortunate as I’ve written about my <a href="https://www.alchemists.io/articles/avoid_zoom">dislike for Zoom</a> before and we
should do better as an industry in this regard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>What I was hoping for was more of an experience like <a href="https://hopin.com/">Hopin</a>. I had
experienced an event on their platform earlier in the year and really loved how you could <em>hop</em>
between reception, the main stage, chats, sessions, expos, and other networking activities.</p>
<p>With all of the above said, the following are notes captured from the conference that caught my
interest. It wasn’t possible to attend all of the talks live but, as mentioned above, being able to
catch up on them after the fact at double speed was a nice bonus. Enjoy and may the following be of
use to you.</p>

<h3 id="_automatic_gc_compaction_in_mri_by_aaron_patterson">Automatic GC Compaction in MRI by Aaron Patterson</h3>
<p>Aaron’s talk dives into a his work around <code>GC.compact</code> which was added in Ruby 2.7.0 to move objects
around and update references in order to keep memory smaller and well organized. The goal is to make
this process more concurrent. I had seen an earlier version of this talk when Aaron spoke at our
local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/boulder_ruby_group">Boulder Ruby Meetup</a> group but was nice to
watch again in a more polished format. While this isn’t recommended for production, at least not
yet, Aaron does recommmend turning this on for your continuous integration builds.</p>
<p>As an aside, Aaron used macOS <a href="https://help.apple.com/instruments">Instruments</a> to benchmark
Ruby. Instruments comes with a GUI tool for digging into the results. Neat.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_humble_hash_by_ariel_caplan">The Humble Hash by Ariel Caplan</h3>
<p>I wasn’t able to attend this talk live but caught up on it after the fact and ended up having a few
conversations with Ariel afterwards.</p>
<p>In the talk, he made a good points about using primitives (i.e. <code>String</code>, <code>Symbol</code>, <code>Numeric</code>, etc.)
for hash keys which is a good rule to live by. Even an <code>Array</code> or another <code>Hash</code> can work. The
important aspect of any key is that object equality <em>must be obvious</em>.</p>
<p>He also mentioned using default values and even the lesser used and powerful default proc for Hash
construction:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>Hash</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>"test"</span>
<span>example</span><span>[</span><span>:a</span><span>]</span>  <span># =&gt; "test"</span>

<span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>example</span><span>.</span><span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>"test"</span>
<span>example</span><span>[</span><span>:a</span><span>]</span>  <span># =&gt; "test"</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>For default proc support, check out <code>Hash.infinite</code> and <code>Hash.with_default</code> support baked into my
<a href="https://www.alchemists.io/projects/refinements/#_hash">Refinements</a> gem or study the
<a href="https://github.com/bkuhlmann/refinements/blob/master/lib/refinements/hashes.rb#L6-L12">source
code</a> directly. Hashes are definitely powerful. 🎉</p>
<p>That said, I hadn’t seen this variant where a hash is used for memoization which is worth
consideration:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>def</span> <span>expensive_cacluation_example</span><span>(</span><span>argument</span><span>)</span>
  <span>@expensive_cacluation_example</span> <span>||=</span> <span>Hash</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>a_hash</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>|</span>
    <span>a_hash</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>do_expensive_calculation</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>@expensive_cacluation_example</span><span>[</span><span>argument</span><span>]</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here’s another variant using instance variables (non-hash):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>def</span> <span>extract_fees_by_type</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>)</span>
  <span>instance_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'@extract_fees_by_type'</span><span>,</span> <span>type</span><span>.</span><span>to_s</span><span>].</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>'_'</span><span>).</span><span>to_sym</span>
  <span>instance_variable_get</span><span>(</span><span>instance_name</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> <span>instance_variable_set</span><span>(</span><span>instance_name</span><span>,</span> <span>fees</span><span>.</span><span>select</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>fee</span><span>|</span> <span>fee</span><span>[</span><span>:type</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>type</span> <span>})</span>

<h3 id="_improve_your_technical_writing_by_noel_rappin">Improve Your Technical Writing by Noel Rappin</h3>
<p>This was a two-hour workshop on technical writing. I’m always eager to get better as a writer and
communicate complex subjects in a manner that is easy to digest so was looking forward to learning
more in this space. The following are notes from attending the workshop:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The reader should always be able to understand something they were unable to do before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing is a great way to solidify and provide concrete evidence of your expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When writing, you want to communicate in a way that makes ideas <em>travel</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always best to write just after you have learned something and when you still have that learners
mindset.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Noel had a suggested process for tackling writing endeavors which is a nice starting blueprint but
definitely take the time to explore and deviate as best works for you. Starting with any process
helps you unblock and focus. The following focuses on tackling the problem, your perspective, and
the reader’s perspective:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Problem</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be careful not to focus entirely on the solution. You want to illuminate why this is important to
the reader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the reader already know? Make a list and think about what you can and can’t assume.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is your goal to get across?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What value do you bring to the piece that is unique to your perspective?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What makes your perspective different?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reader</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are telling a story, like the hero’s journey, where someone doesn’t know how to do something
and now comes back with the skills needed to perform the task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to set up the problem, goal, and get the reader ready to want to learn how to solve the
problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each step should build upon the previous step. The trick is doing this well to where the reader
is also thinking the same thing right about the same time you reveal the solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoidances</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don’t use metaphors in technical writing due to confusing people from different
languages/cultures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The following are examples of technical writing that mix the use of diagrams, charts, doodles, etc.
to convey a point along with good writing prose:</p>

<h3 id="_the_state_of_ruby_3_typing_by_soutaro_matsumoto">The State of Ruby 3 Typing by Soutaro Matsumoto</h3>
<p>There are a collection of gems/projects you’ll want to know about to get started adding type
checking to your Ruby code:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ruby/rbs">RBS</a> - Provides a language to help you describe the structure of
your Ruby programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ruby/typeprof">TypeProf</a> - Depends upon RBI and helps infer types from your
Ruby programs. The documentation is sparse but the idea is you could use this gem as a tool for
bootstrapping the addition of types to your Ruby programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/soutaro/steep">Steep</a> - Depends upon RBI and helps enforce adding type

<p>Alternatives</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sorbet.org/">Sorbet</a> - This is Stripe’s answer to type checking and will, supposedly,
support a subset of RBI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tupl-tufts/rdl">RDL</a> - At first, I had not recognized this gem. Then, after
digging through my notes, I remembered I had come across this gem back in 2016. There is even a
corresponding <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2017/type-checking-ruby.html">Strange Loop
Presentation</a>. At the time of this writing, there hasn’t been any further activity or development
on this project, though.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Example Implementations</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ruby/gem_rbs">Gem RBS</a> - Uses incompatible semantic versioning to provide
types for existing gems. This also means the versions defined in this project might not match with
the actual gem versions. My initial impression is that this seems a bit kludgey and a potential
source of much confusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/soutaro/strong_json">Strong JSON</a> - Provides an example of a gem built with
type signatures. Pay special attention to the files in the <code>sig</code> folder.</p>

			<p><span>The Crash of 2008 has infused our societies with enormous scepticism on the role of the authorities, both government and Central Banks. It is quite natural that many dream of a currency that politicians, bankers and central bankers cannot manipulate; a currency of the people by the people for the people. Bitcoin has emerged as the great white hope of something of the sort. Alas, the hope it brings to many people’s hearts and minds is false. And the reason is simple: While it is true that local communities have, in the past, generated successful communitarian currencies (that enabled them to improve welfare in their midst, especially at a time of acute economic crises), <b><i>there can be no de-politicised currency capable of ‘powering’ an advanced, industrial society</i></b>.</span></p>


<p><span><b>1. What are bitcoins and what makes them a very special form of digital currency</b></span></p>
<p><span>Bitcoins are digital units of currency that one can use, on the Internet, to purchase (a limited number of) goods and services. The digital nature of bitcoin is not what makes it novel and unique. There are, indeed, a large array of digital currencies, including dollars, euros, frequent flyer points, Amazon points etc. Starting with standard (fiat) money, more than 90% of dollars, euros, yen etc. are, indeed, digital. When your bank gives you a loan, for instance, it appears as digital money in your bank account. And when you use debit/credit cards or Internet Banking in order to transfer it to someone else’s account, from whom you are buying a good or service, your dollars, euros and yen come and go as mere digital currency units. Only a tiny portion of standard money takes a paper or metallic form.</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, when an airline grants you frequent flyer points, that you can add to by using a particular credit card or redeem on some flight, upgrade or duty free item, it is creating a digital currency that you are accumulating for the purposes of using it in the future in order to purchase goods or services. Similarly, when the European Union created its carbon trading scheme, to be used by corporations and traders, it concocted a digital stock of carbon dioxide, divided it up in small bundles, distributed them to corporations (attaching to each such bundle or unit a quantity of carbon dioxide that the bundle’s owner could emit) and then set them free to trade these bundles (or pollution rights) amongst themselves in the hope that this digital market would generate a price for carbon dioxide such that corporations would have an incentive to produce less of it and sell (to less efficient firms) the balance of their bundles. Had this scheme worked, these bundles of carbon dioxide would emerge as a digital-only currency.</span></p>
<p><span>So, bitcoin is not novel because it is a digital currency or because it is a ‘made up’ currency. Digital, ‘made up’ currencies are everywhere. What <i>is</i>, however, genuinely novel and unique about bitcoin is that no ‘one’ institution or company is safeguarding the so-called <i>Ledger</i>: the record of transactions that ensures that, when you have spent one unit of currency, there is one less unit of currency in your (digital) wallet.</span></p>
<p><span>Put differently, take gold sovereigns as an example: By their (metallic) nature they constitute private and excludable media of exchange, in the sense that if I use one to pay Mary for a car that she is selling, I shall end up with one less such unit in my wallet. The great challenge of creating a non-physical, wholly digital, currency is the pressing question: <i>If a currency unit is a string of zeros and ones on my hard disk, who can stop me from taking that string, copying and pasting it as often as I want and become infinitely ‘moneyed’?</i> For if I can do that, then it is as if all of us have a printing press in their living room, in which case we would have the makings of instant hyperinflation.</span></p>
<p><span>Until bitcoin’s emergence, the conventional wisdom was that to make a non-hyper-inflationary digital currency possible, a Ledger of Transactions, keeping track of each unit that you and I spent, must be kept by some Central Bank or some corporation. E.g. the Fed or the ECB or indeed Visa keeping track of our digital dollars, or euros. Or British Airways or Lufthansa or Amazon maintaining a Ledger of the ‘frequent flyer’-like points that they administer. Bitcoin, quite audaciously, broke the back of this assumption.</span></p>
<p><span>Bitcoin was born the day in 2008 some anonymous computer geek, using an unlikely Japanese pseudonym (<i>aka</i> Nakamoto), posted an algorithm (on some obscure listserve website) that made something remarkable possible: It could generate a string of zeros and ones that was unique, ensuring that, before it could be transferred from one computer or device to another, a minimum number of other users had to trace its transfer and verify that it left the device of the seller (of some good or service) before moving to the device of the buyer. Moreover, the algorithm was written in such a way as to guarantee a steady ‘production’ of these strings, or bitcoins, over time and in response to the computing power devoted by users in order to help track transfers and, thus, in order collectively to maintain <i>The Ledger</i>. Lastly, to cap the supply of bitcoins, and thus safeguard their value, the algorithm guaranteed that the maximum number of these strings, or bitcoins, could only grow (given the algorithm’s structure) to 21 million units by the year 2040. Once it reached that quantity, its ‘production’ would cease and the users of bitcoins would have to do with these 21 million units. Meanwhile, before that date, and before the maximum bitcoin supply is reached, the ease with which users could ‘mint’ or ‘dig up’ fresh bitcoins (by making computer power available to the bitcoin community) would be inversely related to the total quantity of bitcoins already ‘created’ or ‘extracted’ from the algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span>In a sense, the designer of the bitcoin algorithm (the delectable Mr ‘Nakamoto’, who has, by the way, dropped off the radar some time ago) seems to have designed the new currency on the basis of faith in the crudest version of the ‘monetarist’ <i>Quantity Theory of Money</i> (i.e. the idea that the value of money depended solely on the quantity of money supplied to the public) and, thus, aimed at creating the digital equivalent to… gold. Come to think of it, bitcoin was, indeed, modelled on gold.</span></p>
<p><span><b>2. Bitcoin as a digital simulation of some precious metal (e.g. gold)</b></span></p>
<p><span>What is the great merit of gold? Its scarcity! The fact that, once humans, for some strange reason (most possibly related to gold’s perpetual glitter and scarcity) started using it as (a) a means of exchange and (b) a store of value, gold became a currency and its smallest possible, meaningful, quantity became a currency unit. The designer of bitcoin’s algorithm tried his damnest to emulate gold. Just like gold, which one presumes to be in fixed supply under the Earth’s surface, bitcoin is also limited, artificially (through the design of its algorithm) to a plateau of 21 million units. And just like gold, there are two ways in which bitcoins can be acquired: One is to buy them using dollars, chickens, silk, honey, whatever… The other is to ‘dig’ for them like 19<sup>th</sup> century gold diggers dug for gold. To that intent, Mr ‘Nakamoto’ designed his brilliant algorithm in a manner that allowed for ‘bitcoin digging’. This is how he did it:</span></p>
<p><span>The uniqueness of bitcoin, as alluded to earlier, is that no centralised institution (private or public) is the custodian of the bitcoin transactions’ <i>Ledger.</i> So, who is? The answer is a spectacularly liberal-<i>cum</i>-communitarian: “We all are!” By that, what I mean is that the bitcoin algorithm is written in a manner that makes it possible (indeed demands) that the whole community of bitcoin users has access to, and polices, the Ledger of Transactions (which ensures that I cannot cut and paste my one bitcoin a large, or indeed infinite, number of times).</span></p>
<p><span>In this sense, bitcoin users must make available computing power to the bitcoin users’ community so that everyone can ‘see’ the Ledger, in order to ensure perfect community ownership of the transactions’ record, as opposed to trusting some government agency (e.g. the Fed) or some private corporation that may have its own agenda. Naturally, as the bitcoin economy, and the number of transactions grows exponentially, the amount of computing power that is necessary for one individual to devote to the ‘bitcoin community’ in order to ‘mint’, or ‘unearth’ a new bitcoin rise exponentially with time. This increasing complexity also acts as a legitimiser of the notion that new bitcoins are delivered to the accounts of the users that put increasing computing power at the bitcoin community’s disposal.</span></p>
<p><span><b>3. Bitcoin’s two fundamental flaws</b></span></p>
<p><span>As with all things digital, there are a number of concerns to do with security; with the fear of hackers and e’spivs. Imagine a world that has shifted entirely to bitcoin. Would we not live in fear that some ingenious hacker will get the better of Nakamoto’s algorithm and manipulate it to his benefit? Would it be wise for humanity simply to assume that the bitcoin algorithm is un-hackable (especially so in the absence of some authority that can intervene and save the day if something horrible happens to the algorithm)? Besides, even if the algorithm is safe, there is always the danger of waking up to the realisation that one’s bitcoin stash was e’looted during the night. And if one entrusts one’s stash to some company with better firewalls and computer security, what happens (in the absence of a bitcoin Central Bank) if that company goes broke or simply disappears into the Internet’s darker crevices (with its customers’ bitcoins)?</span></p>
<p><span>These concerns would probably suffice to put a dent in bitcoin’s prospects. But they are not the main drawbacks of the currency. No, there are two insurmountable flaws that make bitcoin a highly problematic currency: First, the bitcoin social economy is bound to be …</span></p></section></article></div></div>

<p>For a long time mediocre artists have used the stories of outliers like Vincent Van Gogh, who only sold two paintings during his lifetime, to romanticize the starving artist lifestyle.</p>



<p>They popularized the notion that is not just ok but also desirable to fail at selling your work. For them, being broke and unable to feed your family signals talent and even unrecognized genius.</p>



<p><strong>But the truth is that starving artists aren’t obscure geniuses — they’re mostly losers who suck at marketing.</strong></p>



<p>Usually, they have two main problems: they don’t understand why people buy things, and they don’t know how to effectively communicate their ideas.</p>



<p>50 years ago, there might have been some valid excuses for not knowing about consumer behavior and storytelling. But in the digital world we live today those excuses are no longer valid. If you don’t use the internet to learn these skills and sell your work is because you don’t want to.</p>



<p>Van Gogh’s case is excusable — he suffered from severe mental illness throughout his life and never even dreamed of having a computer. But you, that are mentally stable and have an internet connection, have no excuse.</p>



<p>If you don’t sell or monetize your creative work on the internet is not because you’re a genius. Quite the opposite.</p>
