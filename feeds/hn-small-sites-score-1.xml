The player returns.</p><p><em>Ad infinitum.</em> Until either the player or opponent breaks the loop, because they failed to return the ball.</p><p>Tennis folks call this a rally, but for us, this repeating structure is the game's core loop. It's exactly what we were looking for.</p><p>A core loop is the game's <em>essential activity</em>. Every sport has one, and every game has one:</p><ul><li>Baseball: a pitcher pitches a ball; a batter hits the ball, or misses.</li><li>Football: a quarterback receives the ball, and makes a play.</li></ul><p>Games have larger loops of course! In baseball, runners run to bases around a diamond. There are innings. There are game series.</p><p>But we seek the smallest, tightest loop of the game. Such that if you take this loop away, the game won't work.</p><p>Can you find a game that <em>doesn't</em> have a core loop? Heck, one can argue that visual novels –&nbsp;which are heavily story-based –&nbsp;have a core loop of dialogue navigation.</p><p>Since <a href="https://teamavocado.co/sports-game">we're making a boxing game</a>, let's identify the core loop:</p><ol><li>A boxer throws a punch.</li><li>An opponent evades or blocks the punch, or throws a punch back.</li></ol><p>From that core idea, we can scope our project.</p><h2 id="define-project-milestones">2. Define project milestones</h2><p>When game developers say to build on a strong core, they refer to core loops.</p><p>Wanna know why?</p><p>Once you've identified your game's core loop, the path forward is clear:</p><ol><li>🧭 <s><strong>The Goal.</strong> Do you want to tell a story? Express a feeling? Fulfill a game jam prompt? Make a game for a certain demographic?</s></li><li>🍏 <s><strong>The Core Loop.</strong> What's the essential activity that defines your game?</s></li><li>👩 <strong>The First Playable.</strong> Get stuff moving on screen ASAP. Code up your core loop so that your mom can play it.</li><li>🥞 <strong>The Horizontal Slice.</strong> Full gameplay. All game mechanics finalized, including progression and leveling mechanics.</li><li>🍰 <strong>The Vertical Slice.</strong> Full user experience with all game states. Includes menus, and win-lose conditions.</li><li>💅 <strong>Polish.</strong> Juice up your feedback. Add more content.</li><li>🎂 <strong>The Full Cake.</strong> The final game.</li></ol><p>Oh, and if you're using PICO-8, you might need to optimize tokens in between steps. 😛</p><p>These milestones will guide us through the rest of the tutorial series, so keep it in mind!</p><h2 id="design-your-game-loops-length">3. Design your game loop's length</h2><p>I think a <strong>good</strong> game is one where the total player time far exceeds the development time.</p><p>Why? Because players can replay your game over and over if it's genuinely fun. On the other hand, you only had to make the game once.</p><p>You get a lot more bang for your buck.</p><p>Part of that comes from the length of the higher-level game loop.</p><p>If you recall Pico Tennis, the <em>essential activity</em> is hitting the ball back and forth. But the higher-level <em>game</em> loop is the <em>rally</em>.</p><p>And in Pico Tennis, a rally lasts maybe a minute. This is important!</p><p>If you're designing for busy people who play games in pockets of time, maybe you want minute-long game loops. So players can play several rounds within the span of a coffee break.</p><p>(An interesting take: Jan Willem Nijman's <em>Minit</em> has game length in its name. Its game loop lasts exactly 60 seconds.)</p><blockquote><p><em>"Man, that's deep. Can I get some dog treats now?"</em></p><p><em>– Paraphrasing my dog, as she stares intently into my soul.</em></p></blockquote><p>Once you understand the idea of a core loop, you start to see them everywhere.</p><p>Take the game of life.</p><p>Not Conway's Game of Life! But actual day-to-day life.</p><p>The core loop of life is a <em>day</em>. And within those iterations lies a life <em>story</em>.</p><p>(From now on, maybe you'll think twice before creating a recurring event in Google Calendar.)</p><p>That's what we're aiming for. With a game's core loop, we tell a story.</p><p>What story do you want to tell?</p><p>In the next blog post, we'll discuss how to go from core loop to <a href="#define-project-milestones">First Playable</a>.</p><hr><h2>🏃‍♀️ Exercise</h2><p>Try it!</p><p>Head over to the PICO-8 BBS.

July 17, 2020 | https://alexkondov.com/how-a-chrome-extension-broke-my-web-app/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alexkondov.com/how-a-chrome-extension-broke-my-web-app/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a long break from personal projects, the situation around the virus inspired me to build something on the side again. I’ll spare you the details but I decided to build a new kind of job board that would let developers browse open positions based on the technologies they are interested in.</p>
<p>It’s a straight forward full-stack JavaScript application that uses React in the browser, Express on the server and Dynamo for storage. As much as I wanted to give Go, or Svelte a try I wanted to ship something fast. Learning a new technology on the go wasn’t compatible with that goal.</p>
<h2>The First Tests</h2>
<p>So I invested around 40-50 hours in an alpha version that had all the basic functionality in place. It wasn’t visually fascinating but it got the job done. I decided to Heroku for the Express app and Vercel for the React one.</p>
<p>Once the alpha version was ready, I entered a few commands in the terminal and I it deployed for the world to see. I sent it to a couple of my friends to get some feedback. They told me what they liked and what they didn’t and uncovered a few bugs along the way. I had plenty of work to do.</p>
<h2>“Probably nothing serious…”</h2>
<p>One of the bugs they discovered was quite unfortunate. The most important feature of the app was a rich, long form which had a lot of client side functionality. It has different fields, WYSIWYG editors, file uploads, drag and drop elements and what not. Turns out the whole form didn’t on Chrome.</p>
<p>The app was still in its infancy so I didn’t pay much attention to that. I had probably broken something small by accident just before deploying. I didn’t even open the console because I expected to see <code>cannot read property state of undefined</code> or something in those lines. You know what I mean.</p>
<p>Probably nothing serious. So did I think…</p>
<h2>The Plot Thickens</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks later I had made some improvements and fixes. I settled on a name, picked fonts and colors and gave the app a bit of personality. It was time to ship the next version. I tested locally and everything worked fine, including the form.</p>
<p>I run a few commands, type the domain name in the browser and there it is. Everything looks great. I send out the links again and wait for the responses, tapping my foot on the floor. The three dots signaling that someone is writing appeared in the chat box. A couple of seconds later the first message popped up - “The form doesn’t work again”.</p>
<p>That’s not right I tested multiple times. I checked the console and there weren’t even warnings. I didn’t want this to be a blocker for the test so I rolled my sleeves up and started digging. I opened the form on the production environment. Wrote a few letters in one of the text fields - and the form didn’t work.</p>
<p>There’s a small preview widget on the side that should be updated as you type but it wasn’t working. No errors in the console either. I run the app locally and everything works seamlessly. There’s something wrong with the production environment.</p>
<p>But how could that impact the page? I didn’t use any environment variables there, nothing platform specific either. I decided to check the behavior in different browsers. Started Firefox, went to the app and opened the form. It worked. Everything was updated as expected. I started Safari and checked the form there. Everything works again.</p>
<h2>We Knot Who, But We Don’t Know Why</h2>
<p>My friend experienced the same behavior - the bug was only in Chrome. I was completely puzzled. I never thought that Chrome of all browsers would be causing unexpected bugs. It’s usually the others that require special attention. At least I know where the problem is - time to dig.</p>
<p>I rolled my sleeves up and opened the dev tools. I wasn’t using any unsupported browser APIs so it’s not that. No application errors but in the Network tab I see that some of the requests are marked as blocked without a status code for the response. Huh?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those requests are for the JavaScript bundles that make the form page functional. The other pages are working fine, though. Their JS gets downloaded successfully. The one for the form, however, is marked as blocked without any message or any response.</p>
<p>My first thought was that a security rule in Chrome could be blocking the files for some reason. I did some reading around cookies, CORS, checked the configuration in Vercel but found no leads there. I scoured the web (and by that I mean Stack Overflow), searched for different phrases and problems that could give me some insight into what is happening.</p>
<p>No thread, or documentation page held any answers for me.</p>
<h2>On The Verge Of Desperation</h2>
<p>What I thought would be a trivial problem related to a missing check in JavaScript turned out to be a massive blocker. I can’t ship the app without the form. If it was failing only in Safari I could live with it. But this is Chrome - everybody’s using it.</p>
<p>At this point I had already spend my Saturday afternoon with no success. The wise thing here would be to call it a day and go back tomorrow with a clean mind. But since I was so invested I pressed on and continued to jam random words related to the problem in the search bar.</p>
<p>Then something happened. Somehow I put the correct combination of words, the stars aligned and at the top of the list I saw a link. It still had the blue color of a page that I still hadn’t opened. It was a question on Stack Overflow, of course.</p>
<p>I had already opened around 10 such threads, all with similar names, but hope dies last. I click on the link, hold my breath and start digging through the comments. Most of the responses and ideas I had already tried, they were of no help. But as I was about to click the back button, my eye was caught by one of the responses lower on the list. </p>
<h2>A New Hope</h2>
<p>It had the meager 7 upvotes but it was worth the try. All it said was to check the Chrome extensions since one of them could be interfering with the network call. Up until this moment I hadn’t even thought about them. They have access to everything on the page but in my 6 years of web development I hadn’t experienced any problems because of an extension.</p>
<p>But at this point I couldn’t rule it out.</p>
<p>I once again examined the unfortunate bundle. They are all named with an identifier, followed by a hash and the file extension - <code>index</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>listing</code>, <code>advert</code>. The blocked one that was breaking the form page was the <code>advert</code> bundle. I looked at the name for a second. Then I looked at the line of extensions next to the address bar. I looked at the name again. Then back to the extensions. Oh no…</p>
<p>A small red icon on the extension bar caught my attention - the AdBlocker. Could this be it? I disabled the AdBlocker and lo and behold - the page was fully functional. My friend got the same result. Apparently because the file contained the word <strong>advert</strong> it was getting blocked by the extension.</p>
<p>Everyone that tested on Chrome experienced the problem with the form. That’s because that’s their default browser and they most likely have some ad blocking add-on. Once they switched to another browser which they didn’t use and had no extensions installed, everything would work.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect AdBlocker to be that unforgiving but as a person who is not that fond of ads, I should be careful what domain language I use in my applications.</p>
<h2>Live To Tell The Tale</h2>
<p>So, this is it. The result of a Saturday afternoon spent debugging obscure problems. After such a session you usually go out of the room with a stern look on your face. Walking like a veteran with all your knowledge and the things you’ve seen. Well, I can’t say I learned anything new but I’ll be really careful with how I name my files from now on.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was always interested in the RF world, the fact that we are surrounded by an infinite amount of invisible waves that carry information is intriguing. A lot has changed over the years, the technology advanced and today you can easily dive into the electromagnetic realm without fiddling with mountains of equipment and burning your pocket.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll explore using RTL-SDR to read live temperature and humidity stats from cheap 433.92Mhz modules, feeding them to InfluxDB using rtl_433, MQTT and Telegraf on a Raspberry Pi (but any Linux based device can work)</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rsv0f-20&amp;linkId=b3bd3c48a6a7e921144609cb59359f0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">RTL-SDR</a></strong></p>
<p>The definition of SDR is “Software Defined Radio”, it’s a radio-communication system where instead of using components that were traditionally implemented in hardware - software is used, allowing greater flexibility and reducing costs.</p>
<p>RTL-SDR is a high quality USB dongle (but relatively cheap at ~$25) that can be used to scan and receive radio signals from 500Khz (24Mhz for the device I used) up to 1.75Ghz. It was designed and built by the awesome dudes over at <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">RTL-SDR.com</a> based on DVB-T TV tuner dongles. I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rsv0f-20&amp;linkId=b3bd3c48a6a7e921144609cb59359f0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> kit which included two modular dipole antennas.</p>

<p>Almost any RF based wireless thermometer / humidity sensor is probably readable by <code>rtl_433</code>. Since we’re talking about cheap hardware you can’t really get any assurances, checking the RF frequency is probably enough - if it says 433.92Mhz, you are 99% good. I’ve used <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33006820989.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.1b754c4dDEUyyf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> as my indoor sensor and <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000872896502.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.419a4c4duApRRx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> as my outdoor, for monitoring my garden soil humidity level and outdoor temperature</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://cubicsdr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">CubicSDR for MacOS</a></strong></p>
<p>This is an awesome free open-source software for SDR. It wasn’t easy finding one for MacOS, most of the commonly-used projects are made for Linux and Windows. It’s not really required for decoding 433.92Mhz signals, but I wanted to get my hands dirty and look on live RF, it’s pretty neat (and of course to test the device is actually working!)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">rtl_433</a></strong></p>
<p>An amazing project that can be used to decode a variety of RF-based devices on various frequencies (433.92 MHz, 868 MHz, 315 MHz, 345 MHz, and 915 MHz ISM bands). This is the software that does the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Mosquitto</a></strong></p>
<p>Very simple MQTT server and client implementation, we’ll be using that as the output of rtl_433 and input of Telegraf to stream the metrics to a remote InfluxDB instance.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Telegraf</a></strong></p>
<p>Agent for collecting and writing metrics. It will subscribe to our MQTT queue, parse and transmit the metrics to InfluxDB.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-signal">Getting a signal</h2>
<h3 id="connecting-the-antennas">Connecting the antennas</h3>
<p>Let’s start by quickly testing our shiny RTL-SDR receiver, I’ve used the two short 5cm dipole telescopic antennas for this test, you should definitely read <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/using-our-new-dipole-antenna-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this great guide</a> that the awesome dudes over at rtl-sdr.com wrote on using the provided antennas. The antenna used is critical for getting high-quality signal in some cases. For our radio FM test any antenna will probably suffice, but if you want to receive <a href="http://happysat.nl/Setup_Meteor/Setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">weather satellite signal running on 137Mhz</a>, you’ll have to be more specific.</p>
<p>Hopefully you’ve ended up with something like this:</p>

<h3 id="listening-to-radio">Listening to radio</h3>
<p>Now you can connect the dongle to your usb port, launch CubicSDR, choose “Generic RTL2832U OEM” and hit “Start”, you can ignore the extra settings you see on the right for now. You should see a pretty moving signal heatmap, you can change the center frequency by hovering over it and tapping space (the key), I chose a local FM radio station that is broadcasting on 88Mhz (FM).</p>
<p>Now your bandwidth setting should be set to 200Khz, you should get a nice signal and when you hover your mouse over it the band will “encapsulate” the signal, click and you should start hearing radio!</p>
<h3 id="checking-frequency-43392mhz">Checking Frequency 433.92Mhz</h3>
<p>Let’s get ready to use <code>rtl_433</code> by looking at the frequency and making sure there are devices there. Usually they will transmit information in 30 second bursts, you can change the center frequency to 433.92Mhz and check that you see data. Near the end of the video above you can see the signal bursts when I switch to 433.92Mhz</p>

This post briefly covers each type and discusses the situations where you would use either one.</p><p>We'll cover some of the many tools you can use for Postgres backups in future posts.</p><h2>Logical Backups</h2><p>This form of backup is typically achieved by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-dump.html">translating all the data into a set of SQL commands and writing it into a single file</a>. This can then be fed to any database cluster to recreate everything. In your CLI, performing logical backups can be as easy as:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dump db_name </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for a single database, and:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dumpall </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for an entire database cluster.

Recovering from them is comparably as simple:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>psql -d db_name -f file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>Simpler and quicker way of performing backups</h4><p>As shown above, a single command is enough to perform a logical backup and another to recover from it. As a novice with databases, this would be an ideal and non-intimidating ensure that your database is backed up at all times.</p><h4>Migration between different major versions of Postgres</h4><p>If you are planning to migrate to a different major version of Postgres (for example, from Postgres 11 to Postgres 12), logical backups via <code>pg_dumpall</code> would surely be your <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html">tool of choice</a>. This is mainly because internal data storage formats may differ between major versions. This is the basis of physical backups, eliminating it as an option when upgrading. We'll go deeper into migrations and how to perform them in another post.</p><h4>Backing up a single specific database</h4><p>With <code>pg_dump</code>, you can constantly back up a single, targeted database.</p><h2>Physical Backups</h2><p>Physical backups pertain to the actual set of files or file systems where your database data is stored. One option for physical backups involves <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-file.html">taking a snapshot</a> of your data files by making a copy of them.</p><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>More ideal for larger databases</h4><p>As your database grows to the size of a few gigabytes, backing it up through physical backups is more ideal than through logical backups. As explained <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-data-safety-and-continuous-protection#the-performance-impact-of-logical-backups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, over time, performing logical backups in large databases could lead to degraded performance for other queries. Given the long run time as well to successfully perform a logical backup on a large database, errors have a higher chance of occurring, making the eventual backup unusable.</p><h4>Achieving Point in Time Recovery</h4><p>Postgres also generates <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html">Write Ahead Log</a> (WAL) files, which can be used together with a backed-up file system to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html">recover a database up to any chosen point in time</a>. When disaster strikes, this is one of the best options for recreating your database up to the point right before the unfortunate happens. This greatly minimizes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/business-continuity/rpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</a> along the way. Even better, tools such as <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL-G</a> are readily available to simplify the steps involved in setting this up.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, logical and physical backups are generated differently from one another. Neither has an advantage over the other. Depending on your needs, each brings unique uses to the table:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Logical</th><th>Physical</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Simpler way of getting started with backups.</td><td>Better way of handling backups for larger database clusters.</td></tr><tr><td>Using it to migrate between different major versions of Postgres.</td><td>Using it for Point in Time Recovery.</td></tr><tr><td>Having the option to back up a single database.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>3</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p><span>The word trust is a common theme in cybersecurity when it comes to network breaches, yet the idea of lack of trust is whatâ€™s highlighted in these breaches. A companyâ€™s feeling of safety and security can disappear in a nanosecond once their network has been infiltrated, and all control of networks and applications is lost. For all tech-forward organizations, the feeling of lost control becomes more universal with every new breach to hit the headlines.</span></p><p><span>While in some industries this scary feeling may be up and coming, in the network security landscape it is not a new phenomenon. Whether from malware, ransomware, or your classic unauthorized access network breach </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/blog/news/the-capital-one-data-breach-how-crisis-could-have-been-averted/"><span>like we saw with Capital One</span></a><span>, zero optimism is entertained concerning the safety of companies and individuals from hackers. Awareness of oneâ€™s level of a vulnerability is a prerequisite to safety and enables one to take pragmatic steps to secure their data.Â&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Rethink the Approach for Network SecurityÂ&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Until recently, the organizationâ€™s IT and security teams primarily focused all their security efforts on fighting off different attacks on the perimeter. While this was the right approach when everyone worked in the same office, times have changed. Due to COVID-19 accelerating the â€œwork from anywhereâ€� approach, we need to rethink network security strategies and pivot them around the user instead of where the network is based.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With more employees working outside the physical office, there is a quickly growing number of endpoints for hackers to attack. In most organizations, the typical employee uses multiple devices to do their daily job. Is each device secure? The answer is probably yes – but you canâ€™t be certain. With each unsecured every device, organizationsâ€™ networks are taking an unnecessary risk. When networks are breached, the process of understanding where and how access was gained is not instant and by the time you have your answers, it is too late.</span></p><p><span>IT and security teams need to change their approach, and instead of solely emphasizing perimeter security, transform their employeesâ€™ permissions and access policies. One of the most common mistakes organizations make is trusting their users when it comes to authorized access. When you provide unrestricted access to any user or device in your network, you simply open the gates for your organizationâ€™s network to be breached.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Once a user or organization is compromised, their credentials can easily be used to infiltrate the network, especially with different attacks. This presents the idea that organizations need to have better visibility when it comes to authorized user access to their network. So how can organizations trust their employees once again?</span></p><h2><span>Zero Trust Helping Us Trust AgainÂ&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Can we trust our employees once again, and reduce their responsibility and impact as guards of the organizationâ€™s network against hackers? I believe we can, as humans are meant to be trusted even though in many instances human error puts that trust in doubt. People arenâ€™t perfect, we all make mistakes, but we must account for them proactively.</span></p><p><span>A common approach that has gained popularity over the past decade for secure network access is by implementing the <a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/solutions/zero-trust-security">Zero Trust model</a>. Zero Trust was </span><span>originally proposed by Forrester in 2010, with the motto </span><span>â€œnever trust, always verifyâ€�. This is the idea that until the user can verify him or herself via authentication, they will not receive access to the network. </span><span>Adopting Zero Trust is not a specific product or architecture, instead, itâ€™s taking a more modern approach of setting up organization-wide guidelines inside the companyâ€™s resources.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>By implementing the ZTNA model for secure network access, IT teams will have full control over who is granted access, enters and leaves the network at all times. For each network, resource or application, there should be a set of rules and policies in place enforced by the key elements of the Zero Trust model: multi-factor authentication, proper device management, limited privileged access and network segmentation using software-defined architecture.</span></p><h2><span>ZTNA The Approach Not the ModelÂ&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Organizations that take the right approach with ZTNA can erase the concept of trusting in their employees and wonâ€™t fear to grant access. To achieve secure network access inside your organization you will need to have the proper principles implemented and distributed throughout the company. Treat </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/zero-trust-network-access"><span>Zero Trust Network Access</span></a><span> as a manual for how organizations should strategize and â€œtrustâ€� their employees with the keys to the kingdom.Â&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]>

                    <section>
                <p>I learned how to build websites the old fashioned way: looking at website source code and trying to replicate the things I saw. I threw in the odd book for the stuff I couldn’t <em>see</em> (like PHP/MySQL), and I was on my way.</p>

<p>This was back in 1999, when we’d write things like <code>&lt;font size="4" color="#000000"&gt;</code> and DHTML was a <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>When CSS came along my approach to learning didn’t differ. But I <em>really</em> wish I’d taken the time to learn CSS properly: there was so much fundamental stuff I missed.</p>

<p>Here are some things I didn’t know that I wish I’d learned earlier.</p>

            </section>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
        
        
                        
<h2 id="block-inline-and-inline-block">Block, inline and inline-block</h2> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
                    <section>
                <p>Even though I <em>knew</em> about these properties, I didn’t fully understand them for a long time.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>block</code> elements expand horizontally to take up a whole line (like a heading). We can apply vertical margin to these.</li>
<li><code>inline</code> elements expand horizontally just enough to contain their content (like <code>strong</code> or <code>em</code> elements). We <strong>cannot apply vertical margins to these</strong> and they should usually be placed inside a <code>block</code> element.</li>
<li><code>inline-block</code> elements are like <code>inline</code> elements, <strong>but you can apply vertical margins to these</strong> (making them useful for things like buttons).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, <code>block</code> elements have a blue border, <code>inline</code> elements have an orange background, and our <code>inline-block</code> element has a red border.</p>

                    <section>
                <p>Images being inline by default isn’t a problem, but it can cause confusion when trying to position them or add vertical margins.</p>

<p>If your CSS reset doesn’t include this already, I’d suggest adding the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>img {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will make their behaviour much more predictable. You might also want to add <code>max-width: 100%;</code> to stop them breaking out of their container, too.</p>

            </section>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
        
        
                        
<h2 id="how-height-and-width-are-calculated">How height and width are calculated</h2> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
                    <section>
                <p>By default, the width/height of a box is calculated by adding together the dimensions of the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content area</li>
<li>Padding area</li>
<li>Border area</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t usually a problem for an element’s height: we’re usually not too bothered about how content reflows vertically. The problems usually occur when trying to calculate an element’s width, especially if there’s more than one element in a row.</p>

<p>If we had the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.some-class {
    width: 50%;
    padding: 2em;
    border: 0.1rem;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The total calculated <code>width</code> for <code>.some-class</code> would be:</p>

<p><code>50% + 4em + 0.2rem</code></p>

<p>That’s because of a property called <code>box-sizing</code> which has a default value of <code>content-box</code>. This value means the <code>width</code> property <strong>applies to the content area</strong>: everything else is added on top of this.</p>

<p>We can change this for all elements with the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Returning to our example, the element’s width would now apply to the <code>border</code>, so our element’s total <code>width</code> would be <code>50%</code>.</p>

<p>What happens to the <code>border</code> and <code>padding</code>? Those properties/values still apply, but they don’t affect the total <code>width</code> of the element: they sit within the defined area.</p>

<li><code>margin</code> is the space <strong>between</strong> elements</li>
<li><code>padding</code> is space <strong>inside</strong> an element</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes <code>padding</code> useful for elements that have a <code>background</code>. We often don’t want the content to be close to the edge of the element’s box and <code>padding</code> helps us achieve that.</p>

                <p>This has been the source of frustration for CSS newcomers for a long time. Rachel Andrew <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/#margin-collapsing">describes the behaviour</a> as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When margins collapse, they will combine so that the space between the two elements becomes the larger of the two margins. The smaller margin essentially ending up inside the larger one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we have two block elements with <code>margin-bottom: 1em</code> on one element and <code>margin-top: 1.5em</code> on the element directly below it, the total space between the two elements would be <code>1.5em</code>.</p>

<p>We can see that here:</p>

                <p>When two margins meet, the larger margin absorbs the smaller margin. If the margins are the same value, they absorb each other.</p>

<p>As soon as we know this, <code>margin</code> calculations become easier. It might also change our approach to managing them, and that’s where something like <a href="https://cssfordesigners.com/articles/managing-vertical-margins-in-css">the Lobotomised Owl selector can be useful</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Margins don’t collapse when the parent element is set to <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: flex</code>.</p>

                <p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. It’s no surprise therefore that the <strong>cascade</strong> is one of the fundamental concepts of CSS.</p>

<p>Though we might be aware of how our own stylesheets interact with each other, we have to remember that there’s <strong>always a default browser stylesheet</strong>. This is loaded <em>before</em> any custom stylesheets, making it easy to redeclare existing values.</p>

<p>The declared styles vary by browser, but they’re the reason that, by default:</p>

<ul>
<li>Headings have different sizes</li>
<li>Text is black</li>
<li>Lists have bullet points</li>
<li>Elements have any <code>display</code> property (such as <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And many other things.</p>

<p>Even if a website only has a single stylesheet, that stylesheet will always be merged with the browser’s default styles.</p>

                <p>Using pixels (<code>px</code>) is tempting because they’re simple to understand: declare <code>font-size: 24px</code> and the text will be <code>24px</code>. But that won’t provide a great user experience, particularly for users who resize content at the browser level or zoom into content.</p>

<p>I started using <code>em</code> (and later <code>rem</code>) for font sizing early. It took much longer to feel comfortable using <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> for other things such as <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code> and <code>border</code>.</p>

<p>Understanding the difference between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> is critical to making relative units manageable. For instance, we might use <code>em</code> for <code>@media</code> queries and vertical margins, but <code>rem</code> for consistent <code>border-width</code>.</p>

<p>The benefits of going all-in on relative sizing are well-worth the small adjustment in thinking that requires.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Snap Search completes one year today 🥳</p><p>To be absolutely correct, it’s been a year since Version 1.1.1 went live on the store, I’m not even sure when I started working on it – but I assume at least 1 week before release.</p><p>This has been an amazing journey. I’ve made many apps/websites/products before – but never have I been so committed to something for so long. I usually get ‘bored’ after releasing and barely hold on for a month or so.</p><p>I’m going to try to share as much as I can about the inception of the idea, the process, what I learnt, future plans and then some numbers 📈</p><p>BUT, before I start – if you don’t have Snap Search and you have an Android device – consider downloading it: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Play Store</a>.</p> <h2>Why a Browser for Android??</h2><p>Building a browser for Android was never the plan. Snap Search did not start as a browser. The idea was born as a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snap-sarch/diidgminbhdappppdmgglehmdoeiaheg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">browser extension</a>. I’ve made many apps before, but it was the first time I was making an extension. I had so much fun making that, I literally just wanted to make an Android version of Snap Search because I wanted that thrill. The extension currently follows the exact same format:</p><ul><li>Select your website/search engine</li><li>Enter your search term</li><li>Results will show in Incognito Mode</li></ul><p>However, on Android I could do much more. Incognito mode alone is <span>not</span> safe for browsing. I went a step ahead and did a lot more on Android because it was technically possible for me.</p><h2>The Process ♺</h2><p>Honestly, I do not have any process. May be if I had one I’d make better stuff or may be this just works for me – I’m not sure and I doubt I’ll ever find out. I’m more of a build first guy than plan first guy. This is a comparison of what the first version looked vs what it looks like now:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png" alt="Home screen for Snap Search before vs now" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-50x43.png 50w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-50x43.png 50w"><figcaption>Before (left) v/s Now (right)</figcaption></figure><p>There were a couple of things I knew from the start about what I wanted this app to be and how I wanted it to be.</p><ol><li>I knew I wanted a Proxy Mode/VPN ability for those users who really wanted to be safe on the web. Doing so wasn’t going to be easy or cheap – and so I had to introduce a ‘Premium Mode’. Now, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://snapsearch.online/app-change-log/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27 releases later</a> there are multiple <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://snapsearch.online/general/why-should-i-pay-for-premium-mode-of-snap-search/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reasons to buy a premium plan</a> for Snap Search.</li><li>The app should NEVER ask for permissions. No storage, no location, no gallery, no contacts – nothing. If any feature required it, I would have to find a way around it or Snap Search would just have to be a browser without it.</li><li>No ads on Snap Search. Personally, I hate ads.</li></ol><p>And so, I just kept building.</p><p>Most app updates involved introducing New Features and UI Improvements. I made myself understand a few things beforehand:</p><ul><li>It needs to look good or people won’t use it.</li><li>It needs to be unique or people won’t use it.</li><li>It needs to work as promised or people will hate it.</li></ul><p>I guess these are standard points for any application/platform/service. However, that doesn’t make it any less important. In fact, I made sure to remember the same every time I sat down to write code or work on the app.</p><h4>Deciding What To Do Next</h4><p>Have you heard of a concept called the “Writer’s Block”? I was scared I’d face something similar – like a “Developer’s Block” or “Maker’s Block”. After every update I’d sit down and think – Do I have anything to do for the next update?</p><p>I always had the option of just improving what is already there – which is a good thing to do obviously, but I wanted something new to add, whether it was a new feature or an update to the UI. The current browser is a result of just that. I didn’t think of the current design at the start, it came to look like this after changes again and again.

<p>In this article, we will discuss multiple perspectives that involve the receptive field of a deep convolutional architecture. We will address the influence of the receptive field starting for the human visual system. As you will see, a lot of terminology of deep learning comes from neuroscience. As a short motivation, convolutions are awesome but it is not enough just to understand how it works. <strong>The idea of the receptive field will help you dive into the architecture that you are using or developing</strong>. If you are looking for an in-depth analysis to understand how you can calculate the receptive field of your model as well as the most effective ways to increase it, this article was made for you. In the end, fundamentals are to be mastered! Let’s begin.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia [1], the receptive field (of a biological neuron) is “<strong>the portion of the sensory space that can elicit neuronal responses, when stimulated”</strong>. The sensory space can be defined in any dimension (e.g. a 2D perceived image for an eye). Simply, the neuronal response can be defined as the firing rate (i.e. number of action potentials generated by a neuron). It is related to the time dimension based on the stimuli. What is important is that it affects the received frames per second (FPS) of our visual system. It is not clear what is the exact FPS of our visual system, and it is definitely changing in different situations (i.e. when we are in danger). Wikipedia [2] says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insight: The human visual system can process 10 to 12 images per second and perceive them individually, while higher rates are perceived as motion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s observe this image to further clarify these concepts:</p>

<em>The visual human system. Source: <a href="https://brainconnection.brainhq.com/2004/03/06/overview-of-receptive-fields/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brainconnection</a></em></p>

<p>Based on the image, the entire area (the grid in the figure) an eye can see is called the field of view. The human visual system consists of millions of neurons, where each one captures different information. We define the <strong>neuron’s receptive field</strong> as <strong>the patch</strong> of the total field of view. In other words, <strong>what information a single neuron has access to</strong>. This is in simple terms the biological cell’s receptive field.</p>

<p>Let’s see how we can extend this idea in convolutional networks.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-receptive-field-in-deep-learning">What is the receptive field in deep learning?</h2>

<p>Similarly, in a deep learning context, the Receptive Field (<strong>RF</strong>) is defined as <strong>the size of the region in the input that produces the feature</strong>[3]. Basically, it is a measure of association of an output feature (of any layer) to the input <strong>region</strong> (patch). Before we move on, let’s clarify one important thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insight: The idea of receptive fields applies to local operations (i.e. convolution, pooling).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/receptive-field-in-convolutional-networks.png" alt="receptive-field-in-convolutional-networks">
<em>Source: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-receptive-field-of-each-convolution-layer-with-a-3-3-kernel-The-green-area-marks_fig4_316950618" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Research Gate</a></em></p>

<p>A convolutional unit only depends on a local region (patch) of the input. That’s why we never refer to the RF on fully connected layers since each unit has access to all the input region. To this end, our aim is to provide you an insight into this concept, in order to understand and analyze how deep convolutional networks work with local operations work.</p>

<p>Ok, but why should anyone care about the RF?</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-care-about-the-receptive-field-of-a-convolutional-network">Why do we care about the receptive field of a convolutional network?</h2>

<p>There is no better way to clarify this than a couple of computer vision examples. In particular, let’s revisit a couple of dense prediction computer vision tasks. Specifically, in <a href="https://theaisummer.com/Semantic_Segmentation/" target="_blank">image segmentation</a> and optical flow estimation, we produce a prediction for each pixel in the input image, which corresponds to a new image, the semantic label map. Ideally, we would like each output pixel of the label map to have a big receptive field, so as to ensure that no crucial information was <strong>not</strong> taken into account. For instance, if we want to predict the boundaries of an object (i.e. a car, an organ like the heart, a tumor) it is important that we provide the model access to all the relevant parts of the input object that we want to segment. In the image below, you can see two receptive fields: the green and the orange one. Which one would you like to have in your architecture?</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/receptive-fields-semantic-segmentation.png" alt="receptive-fields-semantic-segmentation">
<em>The green and orange rectangles are two different receptive fields. Which one would you prefer? The green and orange rectangles are two different receptive fields. Which one would you prefer? ￼￼Source: <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/image-segmentation-using-digits-5/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia’s blog</a></em></p>

<p>Similarly, in <a href="https://theaisummer.com/Localization_and_Object_Detection/" target="_blank">object detection</a>, a small receptive field may not be able to recognize large objects. That’s why you usually see multi-scale approaches in object detection. Furthermore, in motion-based tasks, like video prediction and optical flow estimation, we want to <strong>capture large motions</strong> (<strong>displacements</strong> of pixels in a 2D grid), so we want to have an adequate receptive field. Specifically, <strong>the receptive field should be sufficient if it is larger than the largest flow magnitude of the dataset</strong>.</p>

<p>Therefore, our goal is to design a convolutional model so that we ensure that <strong>its RF covers the entire relevant input image region</strong>.</p>

<p>To convince you even more, in the diagram below you can see the relation of the RF to the classification accuracy in ImageNet. The radius refers to the amount of floating-point operations (FLOPs) of each model. The purple corresponds to the ResNet [4] family (50-layer, 101, and 152 layers), while the yellow is the inception [5] family (v2, v3, v4). Light-blue is the MobileNet architecture.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/imagenet-classification-and-receptive-field.png" alt="imagenet-classification-and-receptive-field">
<em>Image is borrowed from Araujo et al. [3]</em></p>

<p>As perfectly described by Araujo et al. [3]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We observe a <strong>logarithmic relationship between classification accuracy and receptive field size</strong>, which suggests that large receptive fields are necessary for high-level recognition tasks, but with diminishing rewards.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, the receptive field size <strong>alone is not the only factor</strong> contributing to improved recognition performance. However, the point is that you should definitely be aware of your model’s receptive field.</p>

<p>Ok,  so how can we measure it?</p>

<h2 id="closed-form-calculations-of-the-receptive-field-for-single-path-networks">Closed-form calculations of the receptive field for single-path networks</h2>

<p>In the amazing work by Araujo et al. [3], they provide an intuitive way to calculate in an analytical form the RF of your model. A single path literally means no <a href="https://theaisummer.com/skip-connections/" target="_blank">skip connections</a> in the architecture, like the famous AlexNet. Let’s see some math! For two sequential convolutional layers \(f2 , f1\) with kernel size \(k\), stride \(s\), receptive field \(r\):</p><p>

\[r_1 = s_2 \times r_2 + (k_2-s_2)\]

</p><p>Or in a more general form:</p><p>

\[r_(i-1) = s_{i} \times r_{i} + (k_{i}-s_{i})\]

</p><p>The image below may help you clarify this equation. Note that <strong>we are interested to see the influence of the receptive field starting from the last layer towards the input</strong>. So, in that sense, we go backwards.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/receptive-field-1d-conv-visualization.png" alt="receptive-field-1d-conv-visualization">
<em>1D sequential conv. Layers visualization taken from Araujo et al. [3]</em></p>

<p>It seems like this equation can be generalized in a beautiful compact equation that simply applies this operation recursively for L layers. By further analyzing the recursive equation, we can derive a closed form solution that depends only on the convolutional parameters of kernels and strides [3]:</p><p>

\[r_0 = \sum_{i=1}^{L} ( (k_{i} -1) \prod_{j=1}^{l-1} s_{j}  ) + 1 \quad \quad (eq.1)\]

</p><p>Where \(r_0\) denoted the desired RF of the architecture.</p>

<p>Ok, I measured the <strong>theoretical RF</strong> of my model. Now, how can I increase it?</p>

<h2 id="how-can-we-increase-the-receptive-field-in-a-convolutional-network">How can we increase the receptive field in a convolutional network?</h2>

<p>In essence, there are a plethora of ways and tricks to increase the RF, that can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Add more convolutional layers (make the network deeper)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add pooling layers or higher stride convolutions (sub-sampling)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/52drsq/what_is_dilated_convolution/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dilated convolutions</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depth-wise convolutions</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s look at the <strong>distinct characteristics</strong> of these approaches.</p>

<h4 id="add-more-convolutional-layers">Add more convolutional layers</h4>

<p>Option 1 increases the receptive field size <strong>linearly</strong>, as each extra layer increases the receptive field size by the kernel size [7]. Moreover, it is experimentally validated that as the theoretical receptive field is increasing but the effective (experimental) receptive field is reducing. RF refers to the RF, while ERF corresponds to the effective RF.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/Effective-receptive-field-ratio-with-more-layers.png" alt="Effective-receptive-field-ratio-with-more-layers">
<em>Increasing the number of layers decreases the ERF ration, taken from Luo et al. [7]</em></p>

<h4 id="sub-sampling-and-dilated-convolutions">Sub-sampling and dilated convolutions</h4>

<p><strong>Sub-sampling</strong> techniques like pooling (option 2) on the other hand, <strong>increases</strong> the receptive field size <strong>multiplicatively</strong>. Modern architectures like ResNet combine these techniques(option 1 and 2). On the other hand, sequentially placed dilated convolutions, <strong>increase the RF exponentially</strong>.</p>

<p>But first, let’s revisit the idea of dilated convolutions.</p>

<p>In essence, dilated convolutions introduce another parameter, denoted as r, called the dilation rate. <strong>Dilations introduce “holes” in a convolutional kernel</strong> [3]. The “holes” basically define a spacing between the values of the kernel. So, while the number of weights in the kernel is unchanged, the weights are no longer applied to spatially adjacent samples. Dilating a kernel by a factor of \(r\) introduces a kind of striding of \(r\).</p>

<p>The pre-described equations can be reused by simply replacing the kernel size \(k\) for all layers using dilations:</p><p>

\[k’= r (k−1)+1\]

</p><p>Keep this equation in the back of your mind.</p>

<p>All the above can be illustrated in the following gif, produced by Dumoulin et al. 2016 [11]. I think the image speaks for itself:</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be no more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p>



<p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p>



<p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p>



<p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p>



<p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p>



<p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p>



<p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponded singular value of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p>



<p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p>



<p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p>



<p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p>



<p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, we have</p>



<p>So $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2$ is actually the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector $\mathbb{V}\big(\langle x, w \rangle\big)$.</p>



<p>We further have another expression of $\text{MSE}(w)$.</p>



<p>Because $\mathbb{E}\big(\langle x, x \rangle\big)$ is not dependent on $w$, minimizing the mean of the residual sum of squares $\text{MSE}(w)$ turns out to be equivalent to maximizing the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector.</p>



<p>The variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector could also be expressed using the dataset matrix $X$.</p>



<p>where $\frac{X^{\top} X}{n}$ is the covariance matrix of $X$.</p>



<p>If we project the data vectors to $q$ orthogonal unit vectors $w_0$, $w_1$, $\cdots$, $w_{q-1}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. Then our optimization goal becomes maximizing the residual sum of squares on all these projection vectors.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<h4 id="maximizing-variance">Maximizing Variance</h4>

<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $p$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, and $W$ is a orthonormal matrix.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>Let’s try to maximize one $\mathscr{L}(w) = w^{\top} X^{\top} X w$ first, and the constrain is $w^{\top} w = 1$. We would use Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to help us solve the optimization problem.</p>





<p>We set $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\lambda} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{w} = 0$, we get</p>



<p>So by definition, $\lambda$ and $w$ are the eigenvalue and eigenvector of matrix $X^{\top} X$.</p>



<p>Because $X^{\top} X$ is real symmetric matrix and positive semi-definite, all the eigenvalues of $X^{\top} X$ are non-negative.</p>



<p>$X^{\top} X$ has exact $p$ eigenvalues $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_{p-1}$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$. The matrix $W$, which consists of the eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$, happens to be the global maximum solution for $\mathscr{L}(W)$. The global maximum value for $\mathscr{L}(W)$ is the sum of non-negative eigenvalues.</p>



<p>Because these eigenvalues are non-negative, and their contribution to the global maximum could be sorted by their values.</p>



<p>We call the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue the first principal axis, the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue the second principal axis, and so on.</p>



<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $q$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$, and $q \leq p$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. The optimization problem becomes maximizing the following equation.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>However, the solution is obvious. We just have to pick the $q$ largest eigenvalues and their …</p></div></div>

</center><p>1. This handbook is different. It starts with the question, â€˜How can you learn to lead?â€™ In our research with over 1,000 leaders at all levels in public, private and voluntary sectors the answer was clear: leaders learn not from courses but from experience, bosses, peers and role models.</p><p>2. Finally, it is worth learning one lesson from the worldâ€™s top athletes. Each gold medallist is supreme in one discipline: they focus relentlessly on becoming the best at one thing. They do not focus on their weaknesses. No one asks weightlifters to improve their synchronized swimming skills. Leaders, like athletes, cannot succeed at everything. They have to focus on their strengths, practise relentlessly and find the context or discipline in which they can flourish.</p><p>3. <b>Our research found no effective leaders who were cynical about their work, their organization, themselves or their lives. They were relentlessly positive about everything.</b></p><p>4. <b>If you want a high-performing team, do not be afraid to set high expectations.</b></p><p>5. To build trust with your followers, you have to be honest with them. This is hard-form honesty: telling the whole truth promptly, even when it is painful.</p><p>6. <b>Authority and popularity are weak currencies for leadership. Authority can be removed in a reorganization. Popularity leads to weakness: you avoid the difficult conversations; you avoid stretching the team too far; you accept excuses. Honesty and trust are the true currencies for leadership. No one can take them away from you. Honesty and trust build respect, which lasts longer than popularity.</b></p><p>7. An ineffective team will all be clones of the leader. An effective team will complement the leaderâ€™s technical strengths and personal style. Your job is not to be the best person on the team. As a leader, your job is to get all the best people onto the team.</p><p>8. Athletes, like leaders, do not win by playing to their weaknesses and imagining failure. They win by building on their strengths and rehearsing, visualizing success in their minds. From this comes four principles :</p><blockquote>
<p>i. Play to your strengths</p>
<p>ii. Visualise Success</p>
<p>iii. Think like a winner</p>
<p>iv. Create a team that compensates for your weaknesses</p>
</blockquote><p>9. Coach yourself by following the plan-do-review cycle on all your activities:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. Plan - what you want to achieve and how.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>ii. Do it.</p>
<p>iii. Review it - Review stage is where you learn most and it is your chance to accelerate your career. It is your secret weapon.</p>
</blockquote><p>10. After any key event, ask yourself two questions:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>Â&nbsp;i. WWW. What went well? Success is not the natural state of things. When things work well, step back and ask why? This is how you will build your personal success formula.</p>
<p>Â&nbsp;ii. EBI: Even better if. Ask what you could have done differently, or tried to make things work better.</p>
</blockquote><p>11. Warren Buffet remarked that â€˜when a great manager joins a lousy company, it is normally the reputation of the company that remains intactâ€™.</p><p>12. Strong teams are diverse. Diversity means more than diversity of race, gender, age and faith.Â&nbsp; It means the subtler diversity of building a team with complementary styles, skills and perspectives. A football team of 11 great goalkeepers is unlikely to do well.</p><p>13. <b>Failure to delegate traps you into doing low-level jobs. You cannot lead if you cannot delegate. </b>Here is why you must delegate :<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. Delegation is the only way to create more than 24 hours in a day. If you don't delegate, you work yourself into an early grave.</p>
<p>ii.Delegation allows you to focus on the areas where you make the most difference.</p>
<p>iii. It shows you have trust in the team, and most teams will respond to your vote of confidence in them by working hard to show they are worthy of your trust.</p>
<p>iv. It builds and stretches your team: they have to learn new skills.</p>
</blockquote><p>14. Principles of delegation :Â&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>
<p>-Ensure clarity of the task and the eventual success criteria.</p>
<p>-Make the team summarise back to you what they think the task and outcomes are meant to be. Do not assume they have understood anything until they say it back to you.</p>
<p>-Ensure people have enough skills and resources to complete the job : do not delegate too much too soon.</p>
<p>-Be clear about how you want to work together (progress reports). Discuss concerns before you start.</p>
<p>-Be available to help, but do not interfere all the time. When they ask for help, require them to suggest solutions so that they always learn.</p>
<p>-Delegate meaningful projects, not just adminstriva. Stretch people and they will rise to the challenge. Giving away mundane jobs only demotivates people.</p>
<p>-Show faith and trust in the team : praise successes and do not undermine them</p>
<p>-Remember, you may have delegated authority, but you cannot delegate away responsibility. You are still accountable for the outcomes.</p>
</blockquote><p>15. Always try to figure out how to appeal to fear, greed and idleness.</p><p>16. Five drivers of motivation in the workplace:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. My boss shows an interest in my career.</p>
<p>ii. I trust my boss; he/she is honest with me.</p>
<p>iii. I know where we are going and how to get there.</p>
<p>iv. I am doing a worthwhile job.</p>
<p>v. I am recognized for my contribution</p>
</blockquote><p>17. The best way to communicate is to shut up. If necessary, put duct tape over your mouth and force yourself to listen. The more you listen, the more you understand. When you really understand what the other person is thinking, then you can influence them positively.</p><p>18. Good leaders normally have a simple agenda, which boils down to three things: idea, people, money, or the IPM agenda:</p><blockquote>
<p>i. Idea. You need to have a simple idea about what you will do that will be different from and better than the past. The best ideas are simplest: â€˜We will increase customer satisfactionâ€™, â€˜We will increase reliabilityâ€™, â€˜We will reduce costsâ€™.</p>
<p>ii. People. If you have the B team, you have a recipe for sleepless nights and stress. Do not assume that the team you inherited is the team you must live with.</p>
<p>iii. Money. Make sure you have the right budget to fulfil your goals.</p>
</blockquote><p>19. SPIN â€“ situation and specifics, personal impact, insight and inquiry, and next steps â€“ is a classic and simple framework for giving negative feedback:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. Situation and specifics. Give feedback in the right situation: when the person is calm and the event is still fresh in the mind.</p>
<p>ii. Personal impact. Do not judge the other person: that invites conflict. Say how his or her actions made you feel: feelings are irrefutable. For example, say: â€˜You have turned up late to three client meetings; it makes me feel you think they are unimportantâ€™, not: â€˜You are a lazy idlerâ€™, â€˜I was very embarrassed when the CFO saw the errors in the budget you preparedâ€™, or â€˜You are an innumerate scumbag.â€™</p>
<p>iii. Insight and inquiry. Ask questions to see if the person understands the problem, to help him or her explore and evaluate options and discover the way forward.</p>
<p>iv. Next steps. Mutually agree what happens next. There needs to be a positive way forward. You need to have thought through possible options and actions.</p>
</blockquote><p>20. The Art of War advocated fighting under only three conditions, all of which must be present: 1) only fight when there is a prize worth fighting for; 2) only fight when you know you will win; and 3) only fight when there is no alternative.</p><p>21. The trust equation shows that trust (T) is a function of values alignment (V) and credibility (C) offset by risk (R): high risk means you need higher levels of trust to work together.<br></p><p>22. You have no permanent friends or allies; there are only permanent interests. At some point, your interests and their interests will go different ways simply because you are in different roles and have different priorities.</p><div><p>23. The more senior you become, the harder you have to push for the next step. Early in your career, if you work hard and do well you will be promoted because every firm wants to encourage the next generation of leadership talent. But as your career progresses, there are fewer opportunities and there is more competition. Leadership is not given to you; you have to take it.</p><p>24. Everyone is selling: ideas, proposals and social events. We normally sell at three levels: features (â€˜ My computer has 8GB RAM memoryâ€™); benefits (â€˜ It can handle video editingâ€™); dreams (â€˜ It could turn me into a Hollywood mogulâ€™).</p></div><p>25. Avoid selling features. At least work out the benefits, or ideally the dreams, that will appeal to the person you are selling to. Start with what the person wants, not with what you have.</p><p>26. We have already met fear, greed, idleness and risk in motivation skills. We meet them again in selling skills. They work together:Â&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p>-Fear: What problem am I solving for the other person? </p>
<p>-Greed: What hope or dream am I helping the other person achieve? </p>
<p>-Idleness and risk: Am I making it easy for the other person to agree? Have I removed the risks he or she perceives?</p>
</blockquote><div><p>27. The selling proposition varies dramatically depending on who you are selling to. You succeed when you focus less on the product and more on the buyerâ€™s needs.</p><p>28. It is not enough to know what to sell. You also need to know how to sell. Here is a classic seven-step sales cycle:Â&nbsp;</p></div><blockquote>
<p>-Agree the problem/ opportunity. </p>
<p>-Preview the benefits of addressing the problem/ opportunity. </p>
<p>-Suggest the idea. </p>
<p>-Explain how it works. </p>
<p>-Pre-empt objections. </p>
<p>-Reinforce the benefits. </p>
<p>-Close.</p>
</blockquote><p>29. <b>Many leaders come to the realization that they hire for skills and fire for (the wrong) values. Do not make that mistake. Hire to values, not just to skills.</b></p><p>30. The new currency of leadership is respect. Respect is based on two vital ingredients: trust and positive challenge. Trust is dealt with extensively elsewhere in the book. As a reminder, you build trust through values alignment (you â€˜talk the talkâ€™ of the other person) and credibility (you always deliver on commitments, or you â€˜walk the talkâ€™). Trust is good, but not enough for respect. As a leader you will gain …</p></div></div></div>

That is until a few months ago.</p><p>Google recently announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>. It allows anyone to deploy containers in production really fast. The best part is the pricing: one only pays for the milliseconds that they use. The container becomes "alive" when a request comes in and "pauses" right after.

The term itself is a bit loaded, with <em>dynamic</em> being a broad word that can apply to many things. So really, what is dynamic programming?</p><p>First of all, the concept of <em>recursion</em> is a prerequisite to understanding dynamic programming. If you do not already have a foundation in data structures &amp; algorithms, I<a href="https://booksoncode.com/articles/data-structures-algorithms"> highly recommend studying Grokking Algorithms</a> first, which is the same book that introduced me to these concepts. </p><p>Simply put, <strong>dynamic programming is an optimization technique used to solve problems.</strong> <strong>This technique chunks the work into tiny pieces so that the same work is being performed over and over again.</strong> You may opt to use dynamic programming techniques in a coding interview or throughout your programming career.  </p><p>Dynamic programming caches values so that you don’t have to re-compute operations. This allows you to compute every value just once.</p><p>Great examples of problems you can solve with dynamic programming:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Calculating the Fibonacci sequence. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the amount of change you need to make up a dollar amount. For example, 32 cents USD is one quarter, one nickel, and two pennies. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the number of ways you can add or subtract an array of values to reach a target number. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the optimum combination of items you can include in a knapsack by the knapsack’s weight capacity.</p></li></ul><p>Dynamic programming isn’t best for all problems. In many instances, dynamic programming just can’t help us in the improvement of the runtime of a problem. If your program isn’t performing repeated work, no amount of caching will make any difference.</p><p>If you’re very new to the concept of dynamic programming or have never even heard of it before, don't worry. All of these books on dynamic programming explain the idea in the simplest terms.</p><h2>Overview of the Criteria For the Best Books on Dynamic Programming</h2></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="50.70422535211267" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594947342441_16112"><div>

This book dedicates one chapter per concept under dynamic programming. While discussing the ideas, the author provides straightforward examples. This allows you to maintain focus on the chapter's concept.</p><p>Once the concept is clear to you, the author then shifts focus to complex problem-solving.</p><h3><strong>Book 4: <em>Algorithms Illuminated (Part 3): Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming</em></strong></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594930016355_33881"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0999282948/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0999282948&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=7359407268ab91ff1863a8a453d2538e"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=0999282948&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0999282948" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594930016355_33947"><div><p>Tim Roughgarden describes his <a href="https://amzn.to/3fN8sy8" target="_blank"><em>Algorithms Illuminated (Part 3): Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming</em></a> book as an “accessible, no-nonsense, and programming language-agnostic introduction to algorithms.”&nbsp;</p><p>The book includes hints and solutions …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

Me and Joanne in front of one of our four homemade Grommet backdrops that were featured in all of our early videos.</p></div>
<p>Late last month, my Grommet co-founder Joanne Domeniconi and I were fired. Our majority shareholder Ace Hardware made the call, as is their right. It happens when visions for a company diverge.</p>
<p>Joanne and I are sad to abandon our Citizen Commerce™ mission and not see Grommet through to becoming a household name. But we feel nothing but a great deal of pride when we reflect on the hundreds of careers we shaped, the more than 3,000 small businesses we accelerated, and the thousands of jobs we created. We grew to a meaningful scale: where we could legitimately move markets and create demand for previously unheard-of products and even create new product categories. No one had heard of brands like SodaStream, Fitbit, OtterBox, PopSockets, S’well, Bombas, SimpliSafe and Mrs. Meyers when we embraced and launched them.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news one Grommet maker wrote, “<em>I have said it so many times it must sound like a broken record, but what you created was pure magic</em>!”&nbsp; For a small business with an innovative product, breaking through in a crowded consumer world is excruciatingly difficult. Each Grommet we launched benefited handsomely from our reputation, credibility, and gaining access to our 4M followers.&nbsp; I always saw being chosen as a Grommet as cutting two years of struggle out of their path. Many awesome companies would have died on the vine if it were not for Grommet.</p>

<p>We employed hundreds of the best and brightest.&nbsp; One of the current team members said, “<em>The Grommet has made an impression on me in many ways in the three years since I joined. I’ve worked for a number of small companies now, and while most of their founders have had “hustle” to spare, I have not encountered&nbsp;anyone else with your commitment to&nbsp;values.&nbsp;I did not choose a career path which automatically involves helping others (doctor, nonprofit, etc.), so it has been a comfort to work for someone who steers the ship with moral conviction</em>.”</p>

<p>Lynda Applegate, a Harvard Business School professor, wrote a popular case on The Grommet. Out of the thousands of potential case study subjects at her disposal she chose Grommet because she said we were the kind of business that could uniquely thrive in a <strong>modern</strong> economy—with a groundbreaking approach to creating value for multiple parties. Here’s a small slice of what that means to me: I believe that each person in a company is sacred and capable of leadership. When individuals are <strong>truly</strong> engaged toward a common purpose, powerful gains can be delivered for customers, suppliers, society, and the planet. It is then that a great business–measured in revenue and profits–can also be a great company.&nbsp; I was not interested in one without the other. This is what Lynda recognized.</p>
<p>I also hope our Grommet alums will be brave on the innovation front. As one of our investors John Landry told me, “If you aren’t the lead dog you are just sniffing someone else’s butt.”&nbsp; We originated the use of video in e-commerce. We were the first company to assign societal/personal values to the products we sold. While corporations today are scrambling to show they “care” about products from minority or queer or veteran entrepreneurs, or from social enterprises, or about American made sourcing—moves that I wholeheartedly applaud—I take pride that we sourced all of our products according to those kind of values from Day One.</p>

<p>It seems so basic, but we built a company whose people and products you could trust implicitly. If retail were not a catastrophic race to the bottom, “trustworthiness” would not be a distinctive competitive asset–but it was at The Grommet. And it was measurable. While most e-commerce companies find that dissatisfied customers return 15-25% of what is bought, our customers only returned 3% of Grommets. And these are products from totally unknown small businesses. 3%!! This is because we curated carefully and only launched products worth buying, from people worth supporting.</p>

Our investors Bruce and Bridgett Evans, Jill Preotle, and Peter Lynch hosted a progressive dinner for our whole team to enjoy.</p></div>
<p>As a CEO, I am proud that we defied the odds and built a large-scale business, and shepherded it successfully through two financial crises and a global pandemic. We also defied the odds in attracting visionary angel investors like Peter Lynch and Jill Preotle–in a world where women founders get 2.7% of the funding from venture capitalists.&nbsp; We navigated not just one, but two, strategic investors over seven years.&nbsp; A public company CFO friend told me after the first investment (from the wonderful Rakuten) “<em>I have bought many companies. It never works for the founders. You won’t last six months.</em>” Ha!&nbsp; Joanne and I are not quitters. And we not only defied the odds in scaling the business, but also remained friends and partners throughout. We came into the venture together and there is poetry in the fact that we left Grommet the same way. Joanne and I were always a package deal.</p>
<p>I know this is kind of sappy, but I will think back at Grommet under our leadership as a form of “Camelot” for our team, our Makers and ourselves. My greatest hope is that Grommet alums will go on to use the lessons of how a business can both do good and do well. I know Grommet team members will be contributory to–and demanding of–their future employers when it comes to both ethical and executional standards. We all certainly learned a valuable lesson that one cannot simultaneously grow and harvest the same company–you have to pick a lane.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar: for some reason beyond my understanding, our amazing VP of Operations Jason McCarthy was also terminated. The company was on a fantastic 2020 trajectory with revenues up 50% over plan in May and 25% for the year. Jason was very, very central to that success—our business was extremely operationally intense. Jason is a dynamic leader whose teams will follow him anywhere. &nbsp;He was my go-to person for many things from brainstorming new initiatives to putting models and plans to an analytical or real-world test.&nbsp; At Grommet he had the broadest portfolio of responsibilities among all my reports, including Logistics, Inventory Planning, Account Management, Growth Services and Customer Support. &nbsp;He also founded and built our Wholesale business. &nbsp;Beyond all that he is a culture builder who earned deep respect and loyalty during his seven year+ tenure at Grommet, including mine of course. I will be very happy to introduce him to worthy employers and startup teams.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the day (and our run), while the future course of Grommet will not include its founders’ drive and hustle, or our moral and spiritual guidance, we are happy to have shown the way for individuals and companies to support small businesses, to celebrate&nbsp; the work of underrepresented entrepreneurs, to seek out quality products, and to honor trustworthy people.&nbsp; Grommet was the culmination of my life’s work—and Joanne’s. We share a deep satisfaction and priceless legacy with the many talented and committed individuals who made it all happen.&nbsp; I have no regrets. This is the simplest definition of success that I know.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>With the increasing popularity of Python web frameworks supporting asynchronous I/O like <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a>, and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/releases/3.1">soon in Django 3.1</a>, there has been a growing demand for native async I/O support in the Python Elasticsearch client.&nbsp; Async I/O is exciting because your application can use system resources efficiently compared to a traditional multi-threaded application, which leads to better performance on I/O-heavy workloads, like when serving a web application. </p> <p>The wait is over! Native async / await support is now available in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html">version 7.8.0 of the package</a>, alongside support for all the shiny new Elasticsearch 7.8 APIs. To follow along with the below examples you’ll need Python 3.6 or later installed locally and an Elasticsearch 7.x cluster running. </p> <p><strong><h2>Installing and using the Elasticsearch Python client</h2></strong></p><p>Install the package using the <code>[async]</code> extra to install an additional dependency, <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/">Aiohttp</a>, which is used to make HTTP requests to your Elasticsearch instances: </p> <pre>$ python -m pip install elasticsearch[async] </pre> <p>After being successfully installed, you can now access an async native Elasticsearch client from Python.&nbsp; </p> <p>To show async in action, I’ll demonstrate&nbsp;using <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> since an event loop is available right away, allowing me to call <code>await</code> from the REPL. I’ll connect to an Elasticsearch instance hosted in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/cloud">Elastic Cloud</a> using the <a href="https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/#connecting-via-cloud-id"><code>cloud_id</code> parameter</a> for this quick demonstration: </p> <pre>$ ipython 
In [1]: from elasticsearch import AsyncElasticsearch 
In [2]: es = AsyncElasticsearch( 
   ...:   cloud_id=”async-example:cGVla2Fib28h...”, 
   ...:   http_auth=(“elastic”, “changeme”) 
   ...: ) 
In [3]: es.info()                                                          
Out[3]: &lt;coroutine object info at 0x7f2a59bb6fc0&gt; 
In [4]: # Returns a coroutine! We need to use 'await'                        
In [5]: await es.info()

  },

} </pre> <p><strong>Success!</strong>&nbsp; </p> <p><strong><h2>Start taking advantage of async</h2></strong></p><p>There’s <a href="https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/async.html">additional documentation on the asynchronous client</a> including information on using bulk helpers with async, a section on common scenarios you may encounter, and an example async web application project integrating Elasticsearch and Elastic APM.&nbsp; </p> <p>And if you haven’t tried <a href="https://www.elastic.co/apm">Elastic APM</a> yet, spin up a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/service">free trial of Elasticsearch Service</a> today, instrument the APM Python agent, and make sure your application is spending its time where it should be. </p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about how the Python Elasticsearch client works, you can tune into the upcoming <a href="https://community.elastic.co/events/details/elastic-emea-virtual-presents-introduction-into-the-python-elasticsearch-client">Introduction into the Python Elasticsearch Client</a> webinar on August 5th that’ll include the basics, a discussion of the architecture, and lots of time for Q&amp;A.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

July 16, 2020 | https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
        css-media-vars adds several --custom-css-variables, all namespaced with "--media-" and based on media queries, onto the HTML tag. These vars act as universal mixins for your CSS values. If the media query is true, your value will be used. If it's false, the var(..., fallback) will be used.</p><p>
        
        For example, there are several named breakpoints that respond to the width of the screen, such as <code>--media-lte-sm</code>.</p><p>
        
        In your CSS, if you want a value to only apply when the screen is less than or equal to the "small" breakpoint range, you mix it into your value:<br>
        <code>--my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;</code><br>
        From this point, you can use your variable anywhere and it will only be "2px" if the media query is true. Else, it uses the fallback you provide, like so:<br>
        <code>border: var(--my-small-value, 15px) solid green;</code><br>
        <img src="https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/suchborder.gif" alt="Border changing size at 900px breakpoint"><br>
        Here's a link to the jsbin pictured in the gif: <a href="https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output">https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output</a></p><p>
        
        If you need multiple break points, all you have to do is mix a different breakpoint into another variable and use it in the first fallback:<br>
        <code>
          --my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;<br>
          --my-medium-value: var(--media-md) 15px;<br>
          border: var(--my-small-value, var(--my-medium-value, 30px)) solid green;<br>
        </code><br>
        In this case, because the small values are listed first, this approach is <b>mobile-first</b>! CSS Variables don't compile the fallback unless it's used (similar to the expected short-circuting of conditionals in JavaScript).</p><p>
        
        This is all vanilla CSS. No JS or build step is necessary.<br>
        The library is small and built on a CSS trick called "Space Toggle" discovered in the development of <a href="http://augmented-ui.com/">augmented-ui</a>. You can read more about Space Toggle in these tweets which contain links to JSBins you can explore further with:<br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1283596399196680192">Second Tweet, a simple demo</a><br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1282303255826046977">First Tweet, an advanced demo</a></p><p>
        
        Browser support for CSS Variables is currently 94% globally according to <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">caniuse</a>.<br>
        Each of the --media-* vars are using the actual media query in CSS to switch them to the "true" state. Browser support depends on the feature but will always behave as if it's "false" if the media query isn't supported in the user's browser, such as <code>--media-prefers-light</code> which only recently gained traction.

<p>Let's say your module depends on remote module . When you compile your module for the first time is retrieved, compiled and cached. It will remain this way until you run your module on a new machine (say in production) or reload the cache (through for example). But what happens if the content in the remote url is changed? This could lead to your production module running with different dependency code than your local module. Deno's solution to avoid this is to use integrity checking and lock files.</p>
<p>info from <a href="https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/integrity_checking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deno page</a></p>
<p><strong>use:</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ trex --lock file.ts
</code></pre>
<p>this generates a <code>lock.json</code> file.</p>
<p>if in input file you use <code>import_map.json</code> you can specify it.</p>
<pre><code>$ trex --lock --importmap file.ts
</code></pre>
<p>for more information this is the <a href="https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/integrity_checking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deno document</a></p>

<p>Usually I set up sites on VPS services like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-lamp-on-ubuntu-18-04">DigitalOcean</a>, but wanted to get better at producing quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimum viable</a> proof of concepts. This will mean I focus on creating value, in this case content, instead of having to spend time on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/resource-center/tutorials/building-your-first-website/">one hundred and one other things</a>.</p>



<p>In this instance I’ve chosen WordPress’s $48/year plan, as I’m used to the platform and willing to forego some of the niceties I’m used to like <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-connect-to-your-website-via-ssh-and-why-youd-want-to">full control of the machine with SSH access</a>, FTP to upload custom files, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/24-must-have-wordpress-plugins-for-business-websites/">plugins</a> and additional custom software.</p>



<p>I didn’t expect however that I’d be prevented from making minor adjustments to my site like changing the header colour, centring the site title, changing link colours or fixing spacing.</p>



<p>WordPress also prevent you from removing their “powered by WordPress” advert at the bottom of your site. Although I mind that less because it’s a generally good platform and I’d like to encourage other people to share things they learn, with WordPress remaining a great platform to start doing so.</p>



<p>Just don’t expect much control over how individual things look, or be ready to pay for their $300/year business plan to do so.</p>

                <p>Let’s talk tax! Taxes aren’t the most interesting of topics, but as a mass
exodus from San Francisco begins in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are
a whole bunch of people working at Silicon Valley tech companies who are going
to have to start dealing with them in much more depth.</p>

<p>In general, people expect that taxes will be complicated in the year that they
move. However, if you’re being granted equity, as most Silicon Valley employees
are, you might be surprised to discover that they will be complicated for much
longer.</p>

<p>If you choose to move internationally, rather than just interstate, this counts
for double. My partner and I — neither of us US citizens — moved from San
Francisco to Sydney three years ago, and have spent the last few years figuring
out our tax situation. We struggled a lot to find good guidance on any of this
online, so I’m going to take the time to document what we learned in a few
posts, so that I can make the path more well-trodden for the next person.</p>

<p>Although I’ve spent a lot of time learning about this, I’m not a tax
professional. If any of it sounds wrong to you, or if you have your own story to
share, please <a href="mailto:hello@karla.io">reach out</a>!</p>

<h3 id="trailing-tax-liabilities">📆Trailing tax liabilities</h3>
<p>Income taxes sound like they should be simple: at the end of a tax year, you pay
a percentage of the amount that you earned that year to the relevant tax agency.
In some countries, your employer collects these taxes as you earn them
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-as-you-earn_tax">PAYE/PAYG</a>), and you need
to think about them even less.</p>

<p>Equity complicates this situation. When you’re granted equity, you’re being
promised something of value. There’s a problem though: that equity might not yet
be liquid — it could have a vesting schedule, you might not have exercised it,
it could be in a private company… and if it’s not liquid, you probably
shouldn’t have to pay anything when it’s given to you. Many tax jurisdictions
handle this by choosing to tax you at a later point: rather than when the equity
is granted, instead taxing you when it vests, is exercised (in the case of
options), or is sold.</p>

<p>However, imagine you move tax jurisdictions between the date where you’re given
the equity, and the date on which you actually pay tax. The first jurisdiction
now has a problem: in their eyes, you earned that equity while you lived there,
and they only gave you a free pass on immediately paying tax on it through the
goodness of their hearts. When you eventually pay tax in the second tax
jurisdiction, they want a piece of that too.</p>

<p>This is a trailing tax liability.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, any time that you’re granted equity in one jurisdiction, but
only trigger a taxation event on it in another, the first jurisdiction is likely
to say that they also have taxation rights.</p>

<p>That first jurisdiction is said to have “source” taxation rights, because that’s
where the asset was sourced, while the second is said to have “residency”
taxation rights, i.e. the right to tax you because you are presently a resident.</p>

<h3 id="apportioning-income">💰Apportioning income</h3>
<p>Now presumably, if you worked in both jurisdictions between the point where you
were given the equity, and the point at which you pay tax, there’s some
percentage that each should be considered the source of.</p>

<p>Internationally, this apportionment is governed by pairwise tax treaties between
countries. These are typically based on the
<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page28">OECD model tax convention</a>,
which helpfully has an in-depth commentary on this exact point
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page329">Commentary on Article 15, 12.14</a>).
In short, unless otherwise agreed between two countries, income is allocated
based on the percentage of <em>workdays</em> spent in each jurisdiction, from the day
the equity was granted, to the day that it vested. Note that this percentage
will differ for each tranche, or part of a grant, that vests on a different day.</p>

<p>However, those treaties only apply at the country to country level, i.e. for
taxes levied federally. In addition to imposing federal taxes, the US also has
state taxes, and these are not governed by international tax treaties.</p>

<p>That allows states to take a different view of how to decide whether income
belongs to them, and in fact, they do. For restricted stock, California takes
the same view as the tax treaty, and considers the period from grant to
vest. However, for someone granted options in California, who is a non-resident
when they exercise those options, the source is calculated by the percentage of
workdays spent in California from grant to <em>exercise</em>, rather than to vest (per
the <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/misc/1004.html">Equity-Based Compensation Guidelines</a>).</p>

<h3 id="residency-taxation">🏠Residency taxation</h3>
<p>But the tax doesn’t stop there! In addition to the source jurisdiction taxing
you for the percentage they believe is theirs, the jurisdiction in which you are
currently a resident will also want to tax you, typically on 100% of the
income you earn from an asset. This can lead to double taxation: residency
taxation means you need to pay tax on 100% of the income to your current tax
jurisdiction, but you also need to pay tax on some percentage of the income
(potentially up to 100% again) to the source jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Many tax agencies provide relief against this situation, in the form of tax
credits: if you’ve already had to pay tax in one location for the same event,
they won’t charge you again.</p>

<h3 id="worked-example">📔Worked example</h3>
<p>That’s a lot to take in, so let’s work through an example:</p>

<p>Let’s assume you were granted 1,000 non-qualified stock options (NSOs) with a
strike price of $1.00, on 2018-07-01, while a tax resident of California.
The options vest once a year for the next four years, in four equal tranches of
250.</p>

<p>(If you’re not familiar with options, an NSO gives you the right to purchase a
given company’s stock at a given price, regardless of its current market value.
In this case, the option would be valuable if the company’s stock price rose
above $1.00, because you could exercise your right to pay the company $1.00 for
a share, and then immediately sell that share at its market value, taking the
difference as a profit, and consequently, as income.)</p>

<p>About a year and a half later, on 2020-03-01, you move from California to
Melbourne, Australia. We can figure out the source of each of those tranches
like so:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tranche</th>
      <th>Relevant work period</th>
      <th>Total workdays</th>
      <th>US workdays</th>
      <th>AU workdays</th>
      <th>US source %</th>
      <th>AU source %</th>

      <td>100%</td>

      <td>2018-07-01 – 2020-07-01</td>
      <td>209</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>35</td>
      <td>83%</td>
      <td>17%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2021-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2021-07-01</td>
      <td>313</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>139</td>
      <td>56%</td>
      <td>44%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2022-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2022-07-01</td>
      <td>417</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>243</td>
      <td>42%</td>
      <td>58%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Internationally, these percentages apply regardless of when you choose to
exercise those options, provided you do so after the date you move to Australia.
However, those options are also subject to taxation within California, and as
we’ve mentioned, the tax agency there believes in a different source percentage
scheme.</p>

<p>Let’s say that you don’t touch that equity until three years after your move,
on 2023-03-01, when you choose to exercise it all.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tranche</th>
      <th>Relevant work period</th>
      <th>Total workdays</th>
      <th>California workdays</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2020-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2023-03-01</td>
      <td>487</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>36%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2021-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2023-03-01</td>
      <td>487</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>36%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2022-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2023-03-01</td>
      <td>487</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>36%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If we assume that once exercised, but not prior, your options become liquid
shares, you’ll be taxed by each of the US federally, California, and Australia
on the day you exercise. Taking just the 2020-07-01 tranche into consideration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 83% of the income in the US,</li>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 36% of the income in California, and</li>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 100% of the income in Australia, which has residency
 taxation rights. However, you’ll be able to get tax credits for tax paid
 in the US federally on the 83% of the income considered to be foreign-sourced.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that despite having lived outside of the US and California for 3
years on the date of exercise, you’ll still need to declare US and Californian
income, and pay tax in those jurisdictions. If you’d moved interstate within the
US, you’d still be filing federal returns regardless, but you’d also be required
to file a Californian return that year.</p>

<h3 id="gotchas">🔎Gotchas</h3>
<p>Note that there’s a big gotcha in the worked example above: you only got to
claim tax credits in Australia for the 83% income that the US taxed federally,
but not for the 36% that California taxed.</p>

<p>That’s because, as previously mentioned, the tax treaties only operate between
pairs of countries, not between one country and a state in the other. This
means it’s quite possible that you won’t be able to get tax credits for taxes
paid to a state of another country, and will end up double taxed on part of your
income.</p>

<p>For the worked example, Australia specifically
<a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/pdf/pbr/it2507.pdf">does consider Californian taxes to be a part of the US income tax system</a>,
so you would in actuality be allowed to claim credits for taxes paid there,
though the same isn’t true in all other countries.</p>

<h3 id="investments">📈Investments</h3>
<p>You might wonder what happens when you eventually sell the shares you get as
a result of exercising – will those also be subject to US or Californian
taxes? While I don’t have personal experience with this situation, the OECD
tax treaty commentary clarifies this point in
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page326">Article 15, 12.2</a>):
only the income effectively connected to your employment is taxable in the
source jurisdiction. Since exercising is considered to be an investment
decision, any increase in value of the share resulting from the exercise of an
option is considered to be a capital gain, and is therefore <em>not</em> taxable by the
source jurisdiction. Helpfully, this is also California’s interpretation, giving
us some much-needed consistency between what happens internationally and within
California.</p>

<p>If instead you had chosen to exercise prior to moving, the OECD commentary
states that when you moved the asset would be treated as being capital in
nature, and so would only be taxable in your jurisdiction of residence at sale.
However, several countries, including the US …</p></div></section></article></div></section></section></div>

<p>A privacy-focused bookmarklet to speak any text on a webpage using speech synthesis</p>
<h2>
Why?</h2>
<p>The other night, I found an interesting article, but was feeling too lazy to read it. While searching for a way to have the browser read it aloud, I discovered that most (all?) solutions involve adding yet another browser extension. It turns out that all modern browsers have a built-in library for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis">speech synthesis</a>. This allows anyone to have their browser read any text on any webpage without calling any external services.</p>

<h2>
How does it look?</h2>

<h2>
Bookmarklet code</h2>
<p>This is equivalent to <a href="https://leonar15.github.io/SelectNSpeak/selectnspeak.min.js">selectnspeak.min.js</a> shown in this project, with additional escaping for better cross-brower compatibility.</p>

Online meetings are an entirely different medium than in-person ones and we need to get creative about the way we relate online and offline to make this work for our kids.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Here are a few ways you can develop your children’s social skills in-person during the pandemic:</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Forming a healthy attachment with your own child can go a long way </strong>in helping them develop meaningful connections with other kids down the road. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/gentleparentsunite/">Gentle Parents Unite</a> is a wonderful group of parent coaches and engaged families who can help give you advice on how to connect with your child. Here are “<a href="https://childdevelopmentinfo.com/family-building/7-ways-to-connect-with-your-children">Seven ways to connect with your children</a>” from the Child Life Institute.&nbsp; </p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Nurturing relationships between siblings is a great way help children learn to socialize. </strong>We can use this time of quarantine to help our kids develop better relationships with each other so they can continue to support each other and be friends as adults, a time when they’ll maybe need each other most. The Mayo Clinic has some good advice on addressing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/childrens-health/in-depth/sibling-rivalry/art-20046568">sibling rivalry</a> to get you started.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Quality socialization can happen with one other child</strong>. It doesn’t have to happen in a huge group. If your child is really craving in-person interaction, you can consider making friends with one other family who is also practicing social distancing. Doing this relationship well will help children function well in a group as well. Consider encouraging playdates with your child’s best friend from school or class. You can also reach out to local parenting groups on Facebook or Meetup to make online friends and set up playdates. Children often connect best around shared interests so talking about your child’s interests when you put the call out to friends - or finding online camps or classes can be a good way to make friends. If your child gravitated to a friend in their online camp or class, consider contacting the camp director to make an introduction to their parents and request an online playdate.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>A nature hike wearing masks in a small group can be a good way to socialize. </strong>Consider going on a nature hike in a small group of 3-4 families where all kids and parents wear masks and families stay six feet apart on the trail, but definitely make sure you wear masks and that your children do too. Masks really do help stop the spread of Covid-19. While children don’t often exhibit symptoms of COVID, they most certainly carry it just as much as adults and can pass it along to more vulnerable family members. You can learn more about how <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">masks help stop the spread here.</a>&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3><strong>It’s also possible to create joyful social experiences for kids online. Here are a few ideas to get you started.</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Set up your child’s online environment to encourage movement. </strong>Being online doesn’t mean you have to sit still. Set up your child’s space so they can bounce around, wiggle, dance and play while the screen is on.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Encourage kids to do projects together online with one other child or a small group. </strong>Doing a project together online can be more enriching than just sitting and talking or listening to a lecture<strong>. </strong>Even if kids don’t talk during the project. While I bet you already have a lot of great ideas for arts and crafts, cooking or other activities, there are a lot of websites that can give you wonderful ideas for projects: <a href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/">Teachers Pay Teachers</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube,</a> or <a href="https://www.enrichmentactivities.org/">The Ultimate Guide to Staying at Home With Kids</a>.&nbsp; I also encourage you to reach out to local parenting groups or learning communities like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/445786889466638/">Amazing Educational Resources </a>or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/seahomeschoolers">SEA homeschoolers</a> to ask for ideas for great projects that kids in your child’s age group can do online together.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Get creative. </strong>If we stop trying to do online activities the way we do in persons ones, kids can have a lot of fun online, making friends and developing social skills.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3><strong>I asked families to share some of their best ideas for connecting online</strong>. <strong>Here’s what they said worked well for them</strong>.</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Virtual playdates:</strong> One dad told me that his daughter spends an hour a day with her best friend on skype: playing, chatting and dancing around. The parents were thrilled after 3 months to give the girls a chance to get together for an in-person bike ride. After the bike ride, the father asked his daughter, “weren’t you so excited to see your friend in person?” To which the daughter replied, “what are you talking about? I see her every day!?”</p></li><li><p><strong>Tutoring and mentorship: </strong>Many sites like <a href="https://coda.io/@schoolhouse/welcome">Khan Academy</a> and<a href="https://schoolclosures.org/"> Schoolclosures.org</a> are offering free tutoring to families during the pandemic. One mom I spoke to told me that her six year old spends 2 hours a day talking to his physics teacher across the country.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Try online classes and activities: </strong>As more and more families and teachers have started to innovate with online socialization. More and better social opportunities for kids have started to emerge online. Khan App Kids is giving free camps this summer. <a href="https://outschool.com/">Outschool</a> and <a href="https://www.hisawyer.com/">HiSawyer</a> offer great classes as well.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Find a virtual sitter with special talents:</strong> One mom posted an ad on sittercity looking for a “ virtual sitter” and received hundreds of applications. It is only an hour at a time and she has 4 rotating sitters that all have different skills ( singer, actress, dancer etc.) She mini interviews with them and her daughter and she now looks forward to her “play date” with her sitters. They sing, dance, talk, play games. They’re all pretty young girls 18-20 and love this gig as they’re home for school.</p></li></ul></ul><div><p>If you’re trying to help your child make a friend or learn more about how to connect meaningfully online, please don’t hesitate to <a href="https://www.modulo.app/contact" target="_blank">reach out</a>.

<p><em>“Reading books is the real-life version of collecting mushrooms in Super Mario.”&nbsp;—</em> Random guy on Twitter</p>



<p>Ever walk down the aisles of a bookstore and feel an intense FOMO on all the books you want to read? You realize that time on Earth is finite, and when you combine the fact that you need to sleep, travel, work, and socialize, there is just no possible way to read everything you want.</p>



<p>To save time and stress, it helps to implement filters on what you read. Some effective filters include:</p>



<ul><li>Taking recommendations from friends and trusted sources.</li><li>Seeing what’s popular and gravitating towards those books.</li><li>Seeing what’s popular and gravitating away from those books.</li><li>Research your heroes and mentors to see which books influenced them the most.</li><li>Choose only books that you, in 30 years, will be glad you have read.</li><li>Prioritize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">the Lindy Effect</a>–books that have been around for a long time, and are likely to stick around long into the future. </li></ul>



<p>I have prioritized the Lindy Effect more in my selection process over recent years. Older books have survived the test of time for a reason. But with modern reading trends seemingly headed towards older books, it can be easy to overlook the many gems that have been published in the 21st century. </p>



<h3>Modern Books That Revolutionized My Life</h3>



<p>I’ve decided to put together a list of modern books (<a href="https://joebalcom.blog/bookshelf/">which you can find more of here</a>) that have revolutionized my life. Books that have drastically changed my views, influenced my thinking, and formed my philosophy over the last 10-15 years. </p>



<p>I’ve broken down this list into sections you might find in your typical bookstore. For each section, I’ve chosen the book that has defined that particular topic in my own life.  These books will certainly give you an idea of why I do what I do, and why I write what I write.</p>



<p>From influence to leadership, from travel to psychedelics, this list is bound to have something for you:</p>







<h3>Biography: <a href="https://amzn.to/2SvO6jn"><span>Benjamin Franklin</span></a> by Walter Isaacson</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2CHgJFk"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e4pdrIVKL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e4pdrIVKL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Quite possibly my favorite historical figure ever. There is so much to learn from this book, not just about the usual textbook stuff you’ve learned in school, but about his struggles, his humorous personality and everything in between. Ben Franklin is someone we should all strive to emulate. And if you’ve never read a Walter Isaacson book, you are sorely missing out on greatness!</p>

<h3>Entrepreneurship: <a href="https://amzn.to/2YtkxTB"><span>The 4-Hour Workweek</span></a> by Tim Ferriss</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/3fI0rec"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qW97ndkvL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qW97ndkvL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>This is what <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/11/view-quake-read.html">Tyler Cowen</a> would call a “quake book.” One that just changes everything about how you think about and approach life. This book is all about taking your destiny into your own hands, and is one that has had a huge influence on me. The version I read had many outdated (circa 2007) resources, but the message still resonates to this day. Of course, <a href="https://amzn.to/3fI0rec">here is the updated version</a>.</p>

<h3>Fiction: <a href="https://amzn.to/2SMAwbR"><span>How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia</span></a> by Mohsin Hamid</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/3eIXd8Z"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/How_to_Get_Filthy_Rich_in_Rising_Asia.jpg/220px-How_to_Get_Filthy_Rich_in_Rising_Asia.jpg" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-lazy-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/How_to_Get_Filthy_Rich_in_Rising_Asia.jpg/220px-How_to_Get_Filthy_Rich_in_Rising_Asia.jpg?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>What a fun book this was. “You” are the main character and the story takes you through different phases of your life, from a poor kid from an unnamed south Asian country (resembles Pakistan) to pursuing the successes and navigating the pitfalls of love and business. I don’t read much fiction, but this was an excellent book!</p>

<h3>Leadership: <a href="https://amzn.to/2WlIIAL"><span>Extreme Ownership</span></a> by Jocko Willink</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/3jbhRBX"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41lJf8ayabL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41lJf8ayabL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>This was the key book that helped me <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/08/destiny/">become a restaurant manager, and lead an organization of 100+ employees</a>. The lesson: if you are to achieve anything of significance in life, if you are to gain trust of subordinates, higher-ups, strangers, friends, or loved ones, you MUST hold yourself accountable for everything that happens. You must take ownership in everything you do. It is the only way.</p>

<h3>Mind/Psychology: <a href="https://amzn.to/2Wlo2Zz"><span>How to Change Your Mind</span></a> by Michael Pollan</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/3j737Eh"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81z1rs6gVlL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81z1rs6gVlL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>This one has a special place in my life. Having experienced the effects that various mental illnesses have on some of my closest family and friends, I had always thought that these were things we just had to live with. But Pollan’s book sheds light on the world of psychedelics and their use as a possible treatment and maybe even cure for some illnesses. It has since lit a fire under me to learn everything I can about this largely unknown realm. </p>

<h3>Travel: <a href="https://amzn.to/3c0vRdz"><span>Vagabonding</span></a> by Rolf Potts</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2WIDgcf"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91okQD3M2QL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91okQD3M2QL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Speaking of lighting fires, this book set off a personal obsession for me over the last nine years. Traveling was never really a part of my life until I was 21. It was this book that opened my mind to <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/15/road-trip/">travel as a lifestyle</a>, not just something someone does once a year on vacation.</p>

<h3>Philosophical/Spiritual: <a href="https://amzn.to/2KXUV9f"><span>Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It</span></a> by Kamal Ravikant</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ox36LE"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517gFULQCeL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517gFULQCeL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Although there are many more qualified book candidates in this category, Love Yourself was a recent revelation of mine in a time of personal crisis. We all have moments when we don’t quite love ourselves. No matter what situation you find yourself in, this book will help. It is a short read. I read it over a three day trip and it changed my appreciation for myself in a non-trivial way. Kamal also wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/2YsKgvd"><span>Rebirth</span></a>, another amazing book of his that I discuss further in this <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/05/03/forcing-function/"><span>blog post</span></a>.</p>

<h3>Physical: <a href="https://amzn.to/2WqIl85"><span>The 4-Hour Body</span></a> by Tim Ferriss</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/393TWj0"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41f6XL1RyZL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41f6XL1RyZL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>The only author who takes up two spots on my list, Tim Ferriss is a beast. This book shaped the approach I take to physical health forever. Using tools, tips, and tactics in the realms of diet, exercise, and supplementation, this is a great book if you’re looking to kick-start a physical change in your life. I’ve lost 50+ lbs of fat combined using the methods in this book. It simply works.</p>

<h3>Productivity: <a href="https://amzn.to/3d76NBO"><span>Deep Work</span></a> by Cal Newport</h3>

<p>Deep work is an underrated concept. We humans now have attention span of a squirrel. Combine that with the up-to-the-minute need for new information, incessant infiltration of our digital lives by email, and the screaming kid or the barking dog, and we have little ability to get anything of consequence done in an efficient manner. The concepts in this book have allowed me to focus more for longer stretches of time, and I believe this blog and other projects I am currently working on are a direct result.</p>

<h3>Social: <a href="https://amzn.to/3dfxLHN"><span>Influence</span></a> by Robert Cialdini</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2Cm1VvX"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710glEdDlfL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Social" width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710glEdDlfL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>I’m gonna cheat a little here, because this book was originally published in the last century. However, this is by far the best book out there on the topic of persuasion. Influence is everywhere we look. It is how things get done. Even if you are not aware of its presence, it’s power is affecting you at this very moment. Which is why this book has had a massive influence on me. Learn how to influence, and learn how you are influenced, and you’ll never see life (or commercials on Nickelodeon) the same way.</p>

<h3>Wealth &amp; Money: <a href="https://amzn.to/3b2D6R0"><span>Money: Master the Game</span></a> by Tony Robbins</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/30mRfFk"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x2aSRQqGL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Wealth &amp; Money" width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x2aSRQqGL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Most of the basic concepts of money and how to use it, save it, and invest it, I learned from this book. Tony talks to a plethora of experts and hedge fund managers to discuss all the things we should know (and all the things they don’t teach us in school) about money. Tony Robbins is a master with words, and truly does an amazing job in this book through his synthesis of ideas from the worlds best financial minds.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this list, and I hope you decide to pick up a few of these for your own personal growth journey! These books were, in no small part, responsible for shaping who I am today and the success I’ve had so far in my life. I have no doubt that they will do the same for you.</p>



<p>To get the most out of reading, you don’t have to read every book that piques your interest. You don’t even have to love the process of reading! Look for books, authors, and topics you love. </p>



<p>Reading the right books will change your life for the better. But don’t make it a chore. Read what you love until you love to read. And have fun with it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Recently I’ve switched back to Linux, after having used macOS for the past 9 years.
While I was generally happy with my overall macOS experience, I was also disappointed
that Emacs simply didn’t work as well there, as it does on Linux for various reasons.</p>

<p>When I was a Linux user I’d always run Emacs as a daemon (server) and I’d
connect this daemon from multiple instances of <code>emacsclient</code>. This was both
elegant and efficient - my clients started instantly and shared access to
everything that was running on the daemon instance. While this was doable to
some extent in macOS, it never worked quite as well for me, and I abandoned that
workflow eventually. Now, however, I’m back! Time to revive the workflow!</p>

<p>Historically I ran the Emacs daemon by adding something like this to my shell init (e.g. <code>.bashrc</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>ALTERNATE_EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>''</span>
<span>alias </span><span>e</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient --tty'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The magic is in the first line - leaving <code>ALTERNATE_EDITOR</code> blank.
That way the first time I ran <code>emacsclient</code> it’d start an Emacs daemon and
connect to it. Many people preferred to make the daemon a “proper” service that
they can start, restart and monitor, but this felt like an overkill to me. I’ve
noticed, however, that Emacs 26.1 bundles a <code>systemd</code> unit, so it’s now trivial
to control your Emacs daemon with <code>systemd</code>. It all boils down to running this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ systemctl --user enable --now emacs
</code></pre>

<p>Run this command with your regular user (or whatever user account you want to be running Emacs). Don’t run it as <code>root</code>, though!
You’ll get a message that the unit file was copied to <code>/usr/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service</code> and you can examine it if you’re curious:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Emacs text editor
Documentation=info:emacs man:emacs(1) https://gnu.org/software/emacs/

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/emacs --fg-daemon
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --eval "(kill-emacs)"
Environment=SSH_AUTH_SOCK=%t/keyring/ssh
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>At this point your Emacs daemon is up and you can connect to it using both
terminal clients (<code>emacsclient -t</code>) and GUI clients (<code>emacsclient -c</code>). You
might also want to create some desktop icon that runs <code>emacsclient -c</code>, instead
of <code>emacs</code>.  You might also want to set both <code>EDITOR</code> and <code>VISUAL</code> to
<code>emacsclient -t</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
<span>export </span><span>VISUAL</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I typically add two more aliases just to be on the safe side:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>alias </span><span>vi</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
<span>alias </span><span>vim</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that when you’re running Emacs in this manner it
won’t read your user environment variables (at least not those coming from your
<code>.bash_profile</code> and <code>.bashrc</code>). That’s why it’s a good idea to install the
popular package
<a href="https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell">exec-path-from-shell</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can use one of <code>systemd</code>’s own mechanisms for setting environment variables - e.g. <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/environment.d.html">environment.d</a>.
The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux Wiki</a> has
a few <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User#Environment_variables">good examples</a> of
using <code>environment.d</code> and also mentions other approaches that you can consider.</p>

<p>That’s all I have for you today. I hope you’ve learned something useful. In parentheses we trust!</p>

    <div><p>It's been several months since I left social media for good, though I decided to hang on to Twitter in the end, anticipating that I might need it for professional reasons (but LinkedIn rather ironically had to go.)</p><p> I haven't necessarily seen the quality of my real-life relationships improve as I suggested they might <a href="https://notoriousbfg.com/a-network-less-world" title="Link: https://notoriousbfg.com/a-network-less-world">in my post in February</a>, but I do have a clarity of mind I don't think would have been possible with it; I can't imagine being constantly reminded of coronavirus would have been enjoyable.<br></p><p>It took a while before I stopped framing my life through the lens of Instagram, imagining what the caption for the image I was going to post was going to be, instead of experiencing the moment itself. So I'd certainly say that my ability to experience the present has improved: using my eyes to look at beautiful scenery not my camera; using my ears to hear live music not my microphone. Reading Alan Watts' "The Wisdom of Insecurity" also helped me to realise this.</p><p>Something I've come to appreciate in this time without social media is our need, as a society, to "present" everything we do. Even in a non-virtual sense, it's as though unless we overemphasise the things we're interested in, they're not important. It's not acceptable to merely say "I went kayaking the other day and enjoyed it". I must declare my eternal love to the sport of kayaking or it's not of any interest to anyone. And it seems as though everyone needs to have some kind personal "brand" (and some sort of social "proof".)<br></p><p>I think social media's probably responsible for this. Just as we package and present our lives in a certain way online, we feel the need to do so in real-life to make ourselves seem more interesting, because "more likes in the virtual world translate to more popularity in the real world". My generation was the first to grow up with social media so it's interesting to see all these biases finally emerge from our subconsciouses.<br></p><p>What's more important is how I think we define our own personal value. If we're to remove others from the equation, do our interests make us happy because of the way they make <i>us</i> feel?</p><p>That's all that really matters.<br></p></div>

<p>After six weeks of work since <a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0-alpha-3">Alpha 3</a>, we are happy to
            announce the immediate release of EdgeDB 1.0 Alpha 4 “Barnard’s Star”. You
            can <a href="https://edgedb.com/download">download</a> it in a number of ways or try it out in our
            <a href="https://tutorial.edgedb.com/">interactive tutorial</a> without the need to install anything.</p>

<p>This time around we focused on making the database more intuitive from
            both the server and the client perspective.  While there’s fewer changes
            due to our newly adopted six-week release cycle, we’re able to deliver them
            to you much quicker.  Let’s go through some highlights of the release!</p>
<h4>What’s EdgeDB</h4>
<p>EdgeDB is an advanced <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb">open source</a> relational database based on
            PostgreSQL.  The project aims to give developers and data engineers a highly
            efficient and productive database technology while addressing the
            <a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql">shortcomings of SQL</a> and its surrounding ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>high-level data model and type system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a powerful, expressive and extensible query language that allows working
                    with complex data relationships easily;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first-class support for schema migrations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for converting arbitrary strictly typed data to and from JSON
                    via a simple cast operator;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>out-of-the-box interoperability via REST and GraphQL.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the ways in which we’re setting EdgeDB apart from previous generation
                databases is the focus on usability of day-to-day tasks.  One particularly
                gnarly topic is maintenance of server instances: installing a new version,
                upgrading existing databases to a new version, setting up an instance to
                run properly as a service daemon, accessing logs, and so on.  It gets
                especially tricky when multiple operating systems provide their own unique
                ways to achieve those tasks.  Even better if the user needs to keep
                a few versions running concurrently.</p>
<p>We looked at how efficient <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a> is in ensuring the user
                has a fully functional up-to-date installation of the Rust toolchain,
                and got inspired: what if we can provide <em>this</em> experience for a database?</p>
<p>The end result is the new <code>edgedb server</code> group of commands that ships with
                the default EdgeDB CLI. Its design was planned and discussed as part of an
                RFC process which, as the rest of EdgeDB, is open. <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1001-edgedb-server-control.rst">Check it out</a>!</p>
<p>The most visible change related to <code>edgedb server</code> is that it is now
                the new recommended way to install EdgeDB servers on your operating
                system.  See <code>edgedb server install --help</code> for details.  The
                underlying installer will still use your operating system’s package
                manager but it provides instance configuration in ways that allow for
                running multiple EdgeDB versions concurrently on one machine.  And with
                <code>edgedb server upgrade</code> you can easily bump the version on an existing
                installation without having to redo configuration or dump and restore
                data manually.</p>
<p>And how do you get the new CLI tool on your machine?  We redesigned the
                <a href="https://edgedb.com/download">Download</a> page to be more inviting, providing a new
                cross-platform way to install EdgeDB with a single-liner in the terminal.
                And if you’re a macOS user, you might want to use our new Homebrew tap!</p>
</div>
<div id="javascript-bindings-got-more-powerful">

<p>We supercharged <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js/">edgedb-js</a>, our JavaScript client for EdgeDB,
                with an efficient <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/clients/01_js/usage#connection-pools">connection pooling</a> implementation. This
                allows users write faster applications with less code.</p>

<pre><span><span><span>import</span> <span>{</span>createPool<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'edgedb'</span><span>;</span>

  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    conn<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span>'SELECT business_logic(10 / $num)'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>num<span>:</span> <span>42</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>finally</span> <span>{</span>
    conn<span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>'ROLLBACK'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>



<span>const</span> conn <span>=</span> <span>await</span> pool<span>.</span><span>acquire</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>try</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>await</span> pool<span>.</span><span>release</span><span>(</span>conn<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></span></span></pre>
<p>We also thought hard about the API and decided that <code>fetch*()</code> function
                names don’t really sound very natural when you’re trying to insert or update
                data. We renamed them to <code>query*()</code> which is the obvious name in hindsight:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span>conn<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  <span>await</span> conn<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span><span>`
    INSERT User {
      name := 'Alice'
    }
  `</span></span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The change actually originated in our Python client and this is <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-python/issues/51">where the
                    change was discussed</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="describe-is-worth-a-thousand-greps">
<h2 id="describe-is-worth-a-thousand-greps"><a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0-alpha-4-barnard-s-star#describe-is-worth-a-thousand-greps"><svg width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35"><path d="M2.694 6.631h19.085v3.961h-1.944V8.574H4.636v10.962h15.199V17.52h1.944v3.96H2.694V6.632zM13.3 13.085h19.086v14.848H13.3v-3.962h1.942v2.019h15.2V15.027h-15.2v2.017H13.3v-3.96z" fill="#047CFF"></path></svg></a>DESCRIBE Is Worth a Thousand Greps</h2>
<p>As part of the usability sprint we made <code>DESCRIBE</code> better.  When
                describing objects, it will now list all matches for the specified name
                if available.  This is particularly interesting in case of user functions
                masking user types or standard types/functions.</p>
<p><code>DESCRIBE ROLES</code> and <code>DESCRIBE SYSTEM CONFIG</code> in turn allow you to
                quickly assess the respective areas of the database, and make dumping an
                entire server instance easier.</p>
</div>
<div id="stored-migrations-are-coming">

<p>The back-end implementation for the much improved workflow for migrations
                is mostly complete.  The next step is providing a CLI for it, which we
                plan to release as part of Alpha 5.</p>
<p>We think this set of features will be an important foundation of successful
                EdgeDB adoption. You can read more about them in our <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1000-migrations.rst">open RFC document</a> on the topic.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-can-talk-to-us-right-on-github">

<p>GitHub is introducing a new feature called <a href="https://github.com/orgs/edgedb/discussions">Discussions</a>, a
                way to keep conversations happen close to the code which don’t really belong
                in Issues or Pull Requests.</p>
<p>We used to use Spectrum Chat for this purpose but as soon as we tried out
                Discussions, we knew this is a natural fit for us and our community.
                We’re an open product with a strong GitHub presence and you probably already
                have a GitHub account… so <a href="https://github.com/orgs/edgedb/discussions">come talk to us!</a></p>
</div>
<div id="summary">

<p>Barnard’s Star is the first release under our new release cycle. Our ambition
                is to always deliver frontpage-worthy new features, but we also understand
                those never get built in one development sprint.  At the same time, frequent
                milestones have many advantages both for us and our users.</p>
<p>With this in mind we’re proud to share Barnard’s Star with you, a release
                which is a step forward that tells a story.  We hope you’ll enjoy the
                improvements we’ve made, and just as importantly, come along for the
                ride and witness how they’re built <em>as they are being built</em>.</p>
<p>As usual, the <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/changelog/1_0_a4">change log</a> provides a detailed story of the
                changes in this release.</p>

<p>It’s hard to imagine a world without time zones; it is such a basic and fundamental construct of travel, transportation and planning. But time zones weren’t really a thing until the mid to late 1800s with the invention of mechanical clocks that were built to a level of sophistication that could keep regular time. &nbsp;Prior to this local towns kept their own time via solar measurement. In a world before quick cross country travel and trade, in many ways there wasn’t a huge necessity to change.</p>



<p>The very first establishment of a fixed time zone, beyond just local solar time keeping was in the UK when the government wanted to provide a means for ocean going vessels to better plan their voyages and calculate longitude using a standard time.</p>



<p>As railroads developed in the 1800s, disconnected and altering times made it nearly impossible to coordinate departures, arrivals and general railway operations without correct time. The first adoption of a time zone was again in the UK in 1840 as the Great Western Railroad sought to better plan their operations.</p>



<p>In 1868 New Zealand, which was then a British colony adopted a standard time. This became the first standardized time outside UK. Other countries followed in a limited way as the advantages of defining time zones was apparent let there was no consensus on how to further expand the system and many local areas simply preferred “their time”. </p>

<p>Railroads in the United States were expanding rapidly across the country during the mid 1800s. Particularly following the conclusion of the civil war railroads were  what the tech industry is today, with new ones popping up constantly, and incumbents expanding rapidly. But they were struggling to adopt their operations to their broadening web of tracks.  Railroads were still “new” and in many ways crude, railroads often didn’t coordinate operations well between other railroads and were stuck utilizing telegraphs, with many poles and wires being strung up alongside tracks. The continued reliance on local solar time, generally calculated from the hometown of the railroad’s headquarters certainly didn’t help.</p>



<p>It took until 1863 for what we know understand as time zones to be proposed by Charles Dowd, as a way to better manage this. However it took nearly twenty more years for everyone to agree on the best way to divide North America’s time zones. With ongoing discussion with Canada’s railways, the four time zone division was finally put into action in 1883 following further time zone development by Canadian engineer Sanford Fleming . Even this later push for time zones likely wouldn’t have seen it’s way to enactment if the editor of <em>Official Guide to Railways </em> didn’t take up the cause and use his connections to push the matter to various officials across the country.&nbsp; There was still no national mandate requiring cities to adopt this standard and some cities held out , instead preferring to rely on their own time. &nbsp;Finally in 1918 congress mandated the time zones nationwide.</p>



<p>Railroads spurred this development because they were the first type of transportation that could cover distances in a way that would make time coordination important. Trips went from taking several weeks or even months to taking at most a couple days. The rapid speed and advancement of transportation meant that the country was more connected than ever and needed a standard method of coordinating this new form of transportation to let it flourish. Many railroad tracks were and still are single track, meaning that trains heading in opposing directions must pass each other at special sidings or passing tracks that allow one train to pass the other. The trains must carefully coordinate these “meets”, as failure to do so can result in deadly head on collisions. Speeds rapidly rose as well on railroads, with very early trains moving at only 10-15 mph but within twenty years many passenger trains were moving at 30-40mph then by 1900 speeds of 70-90 mph were not uncommon. The amount of precision required to maintain train schedules and safely operate railroads increased dramatically along the increase in train speeds and the shear number of trains operating on railway systems.</p>

<p>For years train crews would carefully double check that their watches were properly adjusted to the master clock at railway stations to ensure they could accurately operate to the required train schedule. Generally the most accurate clock in most towns around this time period was the clock at the railway station. Lots of railway stations either had a large wall clock or larger ones even had a clock tower.</p>



<figure><img src="https://zmodal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4174797193_f7de956eb1_o.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://zmodal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4174797193_f7de956eb1_o.jpg 417w, https://zmodal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4174797193_f7de956eb1_o-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px"><figcaption><em>The railway station’s clock tower – 1954</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even today on Amtrak’s busy Northeast Corridor, coordinating arrival and departure times precisely is required to operate the system efficiently and safely given the number of daily trains operating on the lines. Particularly for high speed rail with trains speeds commonly over 140mph, maintaining a very tight schedule is incredibly important to maintain appropriate space between trains on the railroad and to avoid delays. </p>



<p>Of course obtaining the accurate time is as easy as pulling your phone out. Train dispatching centers use a mix of Centralized traffic control, signal systems throughout the rail system and ample radio communication to operate rail lines. Increasingly railway locomotives have GPS devices that provide dispatchers controlling train movements a clear picture of exactly where a train is and how fast it is moving. This type of visibility has only been common place in the last decade or so.  It wasn’t until the mid 1960s-1970s that all trains had radio systems that could be used to communicate between trains and dispatching centers. </p>



<p>With the rise of the US interstate highway system and widespread adoption of the automobile, trains came to play a less important role in the daily lives of business and tourist travelers. The majority of freight travels by truck, but still nearly 40% of total gross tons of all freight moved overland in the US is moved via rail. The development of containerization played a key role in railroad’s continued large role in general freight. This type of transportation known as intermodal, utilizes multiple modes of transportation such as ocean ships, trucks and trains to collectively move the container the most efficient way to it’s final destination. For example a import container from Korea might be off loaded from a ship in Los Angeles onto a train. The train then takes the container to Memphis, where it is loaded onto a truck for local delivery. This method utilizes the long haul efficiency of rail with the short haul utility of trucks.  Railroads also haul a significant amount of break bulk freight in railroad cars such as ethanol in tank cars or coal in hopper cars and provide cross border shipping from Mexico and Canada. With the creation of NAFTA cross border freight moving via train massively increased in volume. Trucks would not be able to efficiently haul the volume of freight one train can, meaning one train can move the same amount of cargo as literally hundreds of trucks. Trains are also around four times more energy efficient than over the road trucks representing a great way to reduce carbon emission within supply chains.</p>



<p>Likely if railroads hadn’t been the driver of time zone adoption, increased globalization and the development of airplanes would have. Coordinating global businesses, stock markets, air travel and countless other modern essential would be made impossible without the use of standardized time zones.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough worldwide time zone development was somewhat independent of the North American and European adoption of it. While a wordwide timezone system was proposed in 1879, it wasn’t adopted until about 1929. </p>

<p>Starting from this release, all TCP connections are KeepAlive enabled by default. Please refer to the following Networking section to learn more about these features:</p>

<p>https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/networking</p>

<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>

<p>Understanding how the logging layer is operating is critical, as part of this release we have done two improvements that aims to help our users to troubleshoot and optimize properly:</p>

<h4 id="storage-layer">Storage Layer</h4>

<p>Our storage layer that handle all data buffering requirements for memory and file system now exposes an optional HTTP end-point to consume it metrics, so now is possible to measure all pipeline buffers and get a clear status of each component:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/monitoring#rest_api</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dashboards-and-alerts">Dashboards and Alerts</h4>

<p>We have introduced tips and examples on how to integrate better Grafana and create alerts in your Dashboards:</p>

<p>https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/monitoring#dashboard-and-alerts</p>

<h3 id="new-and-updated-input-plugins">New and updated Input Plugins</h3>

<h4 id="forward">Forward</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/forward">Forward input plugin</a> speaks the <code>Fluentd Forward</code> protocol. In this version we added support for <code>ACK</code> feature to enable <em>at-least-once</em>. It also adds support to handle GZIP compressed payloads.</p>

<h4 id="docker-events">Docker Events</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/docker-events">Docker Events input plugin</a> allows to retrieve any event generated by Docker engine on any management task of containers. All possible events are listed <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="new-and-updated-enterprise-services-output-plugins">New and updated enterprise services Output Plugins</h3>

<p>On this release cycle, we did a joint work with companies who are contributing with improvements and new connectors for their own services. Primary, we have the official addition of the following output plugins:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/cloudwatch">Amazon CloudWatch Logs</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/logdna">LogDNA</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/new-relic">New Relic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition the following output plugins has been extended:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/stackdriver">Google Stackdriver</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/postgresql">PostgreSQL</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Special thanks to Amazon, LogDNA, New Relic, Google, Sumo Logic and 2nd Quadrant for their contributions!</p>

<h3 id="amazon-credentials-and-cloudwatch">Amazon Credentials and CloudWatch</h3>

<p>In Fluent Bit 1.5, AWS adds full support for all standard credential sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Environment Variables</p>
  </li>
  <li>AWS Profile</li>
  <li>EC2 Instance Role</li>
  <li>ECS IAM Roles for Tasks</li>
  <li>EKS IAM Roles for Service Accounts</li>
  <li>STS Assume Role</li>
</ul>

<p>These credential sources can be used to sign requests made to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">Amazon ElasticSearch</a> Service by Fluent Bit’s <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch plugin</a>. Finally, a <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/cloudwatch">CloudWatch Logs</a> plugin was contributed for Amazon CloudWatch Logs which can replace the <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-logs-for-fluent-bit">external Golang plugin launched last year</a>. The new plugin was written in <strong>C</strong> in the core of Fluent Bit; it is much more performant and efficient that the Golang plugin.</p>

<h3 id="logdna">LogDNA</h3>

<p>In this version we are announcing the new certified connector for <a href="https://logdna.com/">LogDNA</a> service called <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/logdna">LogDNA Output Plugin</a>. This plugin is fully compatible with the main service and also with IBM Log Analysis.</p>

<p>The plugin comes with <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/logdna#auto-enrichment-and-data-discovery">Auto Enrichment and Data discovery</a> features.</p>

<h3 id="new-relic">New Relic</h3>

<p>New Relic integration is not new to Fluent Bit, the company already ships their own Go connector. But this time, we did a joint work and we are bringing a new native/built-in connector for the service. The name of the built-in plugin is <code>nrlogs</code>.</p>

<p>New Relic customers can use any of both certified connectors for now, users can migrate at their own pace.</p>

<h3 id="postgresql">PostgreSQL</h3>

<p>The updated PostgreSQL connector now support both asynchronous and synchronous connections. It also adds support for <code>.pgpass</code> that allows clients to store database credentials outside of the main Fluent Bit configuration.</p>

<p>The plugin also comes with granular <code>log_level</code> support.</p>

<h3 id="google-stackdriver">Google Stackdriver</h3>

<p>Now you can configure resource types for Kubernetes containers, pods and nodes, so you can search logs by the corresponding Kubernetes resource.</p>

<p>You can add an associated operation as a special field in a record and the <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/stackdriver">Stackdriver output plugin</a> will extract it. For example, if you have a long running machine learning model training operation, you can mark multiple logs with the same operation ID, so you can search logs by the operation ID as a top-level field.</p>

<p>Also you can add labels as a special field in a record and the <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/stackdriver">Stackdriver output</a> will extract them. If your application is deployed in several environments: test, staging and production, you can specify them as with the label “environment,” and you can search logs by the environments  as a top-level field to troubleshoot issues for that environment specifically.</p>

<h3 id="windows-support">Windows Support</h3>

<p>Maintainers and overall community have worked hard to get things working properly on Windows, this version comes with exciting enhancements!:</p>

<p><strong>Windows Service Support</strong></p>

<p>Windows Service is a standard interface to run programs in system background, equivalent of daemons on Linux and BSD. Starting from v1.5, now is possible to register Fluent Bit as a Windows Service.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Event Log Input Plugin</strong></p>

<p>The output format of the data collected by <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/windows-event-log">Winlog input plugin</a> has been improved. It now explicit exports UTF-8 encoded fields, and also human-readable values for event types and log messages.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Kubernetes Support</strong></p>

<p>Fluent Bit <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/kubernetes">Kubernetes filter</a> needed some extra features to workaround some networking issues on starting up, in this version we have added two new configuration properties to handle DNS issues on Windows environments: <code>DNS_Retries</code> and <code>DNS_Wait_Time</code></p>

<p>In addition, the Tail input plugin now handle Tags properly when using the standard file layout in Windows Pod.</p>

<h2 id="contributors">Contributors</h2>

<p>On every release, there are many people involved doing contributions on different areas like bug reporting, troubleshooting, documentation and coding, without these contributions from the community, the project won’t be the same and won’t be in the good shape that it is now. So THANK YOU! to everyone who takes part of this journey!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Your resume will be the first point of contact with the company you’re applying for. It’s absolutely <strong>crucial</strong> that your resume creates a good first impression. The receiver of your resume can either be a recruiter, or someone directly from the company. Either way, the entire goal of your resume is to get the recruiter or company to advance you to the next step in the hiring process.</p> <h2 id="adapt-to-the-position">Adapt to the position</h2> <p>There’s a lot of stuff that goes into creating a compelling resume, but most importantly: <strong>you have to adapt your resume to the job you’re applying for</strong>. One of the most common mistakes is to send the same resume to 500 companies and hope to hear back - this doesn’t work. Instead, you need to personalize your resume to match the job spec. If you’re applying for a React job, put your React projects on top of your project list. If you’re applying for a data science job, highlight your strong Python capabilities. Make sure you include the most important <strong>keywords</strong> from the job spec.</p> <p>This does not just apply to technical skills either. When you’re researching the company website and reading through the job specification, take note of <strong>which values are important to the company</strong>. If they talk a lot about the importance of learning and self-improvement among employees, mention how you learned to code by doing tutorials at night. Or if their mission evolves around creating transparent, customer-centric solutions, talk about how you did that while working at X previous job.</p> <p>There’s several reasons for doing this. Firstly, you show that you’ve done your due diligence. You’ve read the job specification carefully and researched the company. This proves that you’ve spent some time on your application, and definitely more than the people who throw the same resume to every company. It also proves that you understand and care about the company mission, which makes you more relatable to hiring managers and indicates that you will fit in well with the other employees and the company culture as a whole.</p> <h2 id="highlight-skills-learned-from-other-fields">Highlight skills learned from other fields</h2> <p>A great resume is especially important early in your career, when you don’t have a lot of relevant experience. This is where you will need to rely entirely on your resume to move on to the next round. Later on, your previous work experience will do a lot of the heavy lifting - but that’s not the case if you’re applying for your first developer job.</p> <p>However, even if you don’t have a lot of related developer experience, you can still show your previous work places. Use these to highlight skills you learned <strong>that are also relevant for this job</strong>. If you’ve worked as a cashier, write how that has helped you interacting with customers and showing politeness. Or how being a football coach has taught you the importance of teamwork and leadership. Whatever your previous experience has been, highlight the key learnings from each.</p> <p>You can also use this to showcase some of your favourite moments from previous jobs, developer related or not. Things like “got promoted to manager after 2 years” or “launched a non-profit website on a super tight deadline” or “learned a new language for a specific project on the job”. If you’ve done awesome things that you’re proud of, don’t be afraid to show it. It feels more human than just listing the responsibilities you had.</p> <h2 id="practical-quick-wins">Practical quick wins</h2> <p>Keeping all of this in mind, there are also some simple, quick-win tips you can apply to make your resume more compelling:</p> <ul> <li>Keep it at <strong>1-2 page maximum</strong>. The receiver will simply not have time to read long walls of text. There might be potentially better candidates applying for this job, but by keeping your resume concise, you’ll get an advantage over them by actually having your resume read. Stick to a few (2-4) bullet points for each previous job or project.</li> <li><strong>Put your experience and skills at the top.</strong> This is the most important part of the resume, so make sure the receiver doesn’t accidentally miss it, or discard your resume before getting to these sections.</li> <li><strong>Show some personality.</strong> You don’t need to go crazy with colors and images, but adding small visual design elements will help your resume to stand out.</li> <li><strong>Use a template.</strong> There are tons of good CV template builders on the internet. Using a template will make your resume look more professional at a glance.</li> <li><strong>Proofread.</strong> And have a friend proofread as well. You want your resume to be as free of spelling mistakes and poor wording as possible.</li> </ul> <h2 id="final-notes">Final notes</h2> <p>Your resume might be your only chance at landing a particular job. The receiver of your resume will have to make a very quick judgement call of whether or not there’s a chance of you providing value to the company. If there is, you’ll move to the next round. If not, your application will get discarded.</p> <p>This may seem very cutthroat - and that’s because it is. But it’s how the world works. When reviewing your resume, try to put yourself in the shoes of the company or recruiter receiving it - would you pass yourself on to the next round? Even if you had as little as <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">7.4 seconds</a> to decide? If not, your resume could still use some work.</p>  <div> <p><img alt="" src="https://madsbrodt.com/profile.jpg"></p><p> I'm <span>Mads Brodt</span> — a developer, author, teacher, creator and blogger.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
    I had a simple problem, I wanted to sell membership to <a href="https://smashnotes.com/clubhouse?utm_source=smashnotes.com&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_term=Clubhouse">The Clubhouse</a>, and I did not want to spend a lot of time building the infrastructure to do it. Really, all I wanted was a "buy now" button, a single landing page that could accept payments effortlessly, so I could then focus all of the efforts on outreach, instead of writing more code. 

Normally, for anything that involves taking payments, I would use Stripe. They are a trusted solution that somehow does everything right, every time. Honestly, I love them, but just as matter of curiosity, since I have been using Stripe for almost 10 years, I decided to explore alternatives. Shopify stock was going through the roof, I figured to try it out.

Before we go any further, I want to preface this by saying the purpose of this writeup is not to dunk on any of the payment providers. Each provider is there to accomplish a different objective,.

This is just a quick view into what you can expect, if you decide to sell with either Shopify or PayPal.

</p><h3>Getting started with Shopify</h3><p>

Getting started with Shopify was insanely easy. In quite literally less than five minutes I had my store setup and ready to sell a product on the internet. Unbelievably, insanely good start. In fact, if you have not had the pleasure of setting up a store yet, I recommend you get a Shopify account and try to sell something, even if it is fake, just to go through the experience. 

Unfortunately, my experimented ended right there because almost immediately Shopify blocked my account. What?! The exact reasons for blocking were murky, but I did a few things that may have caused fraud prevention to get some funny tickles.

</p><h3>How to get banned by Shopify 101</h3><p>

First,  there was no way to run a test transaction on Shopify, and to verify that my store was actually working, I had to buy my own product, so I did! Since signing up was so easy, I tested my own listing within minutes of signup. Great if you are testing, but suspicious if you are an algorithm.

Second, Shopify was designed for physical goods. You have to actually list your "inventory," which does not make any sense for a digital product. 10k Patio chairs is a lot, but for a digital product, anyone over 1 is the same. When I listed 10,000 units, it probably made some alarms go off.

Third, once I had my product set up, I switched to a "Shopify Button," a function advertised on their website, but very well hidden for anyone to actually use. It was exactly what I wanted - a simple "Buy Now" button that you can place anywhere, and even connect to social places like Facebook to sell direct. This option was perfect for me, but it required actually deleting my Shopify store, while maintaining my listed inventory. Honestly, I do not think their system actually expects this to happen.

All in all, quickly launching a store, listing 10,000 unites of inventory, and then hiding the store and replacing it with a button was enough for some algorithm to get worried and I got blocked. I did not like it, but if I were a scammer, I could hypothetically setup a new Shopify store with a fake product, run ads against it on social, collect millions of dollars in payments in minutes, all before anyone realizes it was just a front. It probably happens more often than we know, and I understand that Shopify needs to block potential fraud.

Getting locked out was not a big deal, really, but what really sucked was the way it was done. You lose access, to everything, without any notice and you cannot even contact support because being able to contact their support requires that you log into your account, the access to which you do not have! If it was not for a friend that I knew was working at Shopify, I do not know how I would unlocked my account again.

Thanks to my friend, the account got unblocked, and I was asked to provide some details in order to reactivate it. Well, to be specific, I was asked to provide ALL the details: passport, drivers, proof of address, ... [get the list]. I was asked to upload all of this highly sensitive personal information on myself into an online form, and hope for the best. Huh?! 

If I was a merchant that really needed to setup a store specifically with Shopify, I would probably jump through the hoops. But, given that I always have Stripe (love you!!!), giving all of my private information to Shopify`s random drop form did not seem like a good idea. Honestly, I do not know why they could not simply check my Keybase, or at least use a verified identity vendor, like the one used by  Airbnb or Coinbase.

Anyway, that was the end of Shopify for me[1].

</p><h3>Moving to PayPal</h3><p>

At this point a few days have gone by and I really wanted to start connecting with people, but there was still one problem, I needed to take payments. Sure, I could have faked it with a button that did not work and just collect intent, but if setting Shopify was only a matter of minutes, there had to be way!

Aha, the old forgotten friend PayPal! 

PayPal was built for this, to accept one-off payments for online transactions, from anyone in the world. I have a business account with them and I have used it before to both receive money and pay out too. Thinking that having a history on the account would help me avoid some obscure red flags, I dove into PayPal head first.

Getting started was relatively easy. Just go to Get Paid &gt; PayPal Button and choose the option applicable to you. I was looking into Smart Buttons vs Buy Now buttons, and the former seemed like a more modern solution, but turned out a fancy mess. Settings are in one place, test accounts in another, test numbers for the credit card are in yet another place, and when you put it all together, it still does not work. It felt like multiple startup acquisitions that have never finished integrating with each other. Ugh.

I was pretty close to giving up, and going back to beloved Stripe, but as one last experiment, I looked into their most basic old school "Buy Now" button from PayPal. It worked!

This is rather odd to admit, but the "Buy Now" button that was developed close to 20 years ago is still the easiest way to collect money online. It is ugly, it uses a basic Form to post values, and it is got an Image[2] as the main clickable element, but it works!

This version of the button lets me do everything in one go - specify the product, specify the cost,  put the code on the site and run it. All in just one step.

</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>

Alright, so what is the best solution to selling a one-off item online? Is it Stripe, Shopify, or is it actually PayPal?

Honestly, if you just need to sell something, just use PayPal. It is not going to have fancy features or look pretty good, there his no inventory tracking, or integrations, there is nothing but a dumb button and a way to take money.

I am still a little amused that a product that was create 20 years ago is the best option today. 

Of course, if you are selling a physical good, something that requires packaging, shipping, tracking and all the complexity that goes with it, I would say give Shopify a really deep try. They seem to have it all integrated, and even if you have to jump through the verification hoops, provided you have a real business, it would probably be all worth it.

Lastly, if you are building an online sales funnel, want to integrate your app with your customers` data, and in general enjoy working with a company that does everything amazingly well, there is always Stripe!

Happy hacking.

[1] One interesting bit to note, it seems that Shopify is actually using Stripe to collect their payments on their end. I infer from getting a Stripe error message, that came through on the Shopify front-end.

[2] Besides, if you want to make it less ugly, all it takes is to replace the Image with a Button and apply your own styles. It still works.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>tl;dl Rust port of
<a href="https://kholdstare.github.io/technical/2020/05/26/faster-integer-parsing.html">https://kholdstare.github.io/technical/2020/05/26/faster-integer-parsing.html</a>
to parse fixed 16 integer.</p>

<p>Note that a lot of the text are taken from the original article along with my
additional comments but the code will be written as Rust.</p>



<p>Let’s say, theoretically, you have some text-based protocol, or file that
contains microsecond timestamps. You need to parse these timestamps as quickly
as possible. Maybe it is JSON, maybe it is a CSV file, maybe something else
bespoke. It’s 16 characters long, and this could also apply to credit card
numbers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>timestamp,event_id
1585201087123567,a
1585201087123585,b
1585201087123621,c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the end you have to implement a function similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>parse_timestamp</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>todo!</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>We will be using nightly to be able to use the feature <code>test</code> which comes with
the nightly release. Use <code>rustup toolchain add nightly</code> to install the nigthly
toolchain.</p>

<p>We will be creating the project by using <code>cargo new parseint --lib</code> to create a
new library. Next, we will specify that we will be using the nightly toolchain
for this crate by <code>echo nightly &gt; rust-toolchain</code>.</p>

<p>Our <code>benches/bench.rs</code> will be something like the following.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#![feature(test)]</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>crate</span> <span>test</span><span>;</span>

<span>use</span> <span>parseint</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>test</span><span>::{</span><span>black_box</span><span>,</span> <span>Bencher</span><span>};</span>

<span>const</span> <span>EXAMPLE_TIMESTAMP</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1585201087123789"</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>EXPECTED_TIMESTAMP</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span> <span>=</span> <span>1585201087123789</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Every time we create a new function for benchmark, we will append the following
block to <code>benches/bench.rs</code> prepended by <code>bench_</code> to keep naming simple. Say we
have a function <code>str_parse</code> (coming up next), so it will not be written later.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[bench]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>bench_str_parse</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Bencher</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>str_parse</span><span>(</span><span>EXAMPLE_TIMESTAMP</span><span>),</span> <span>EXPECTED_TIMESTAMP</span><span>);</span>
    <span>b</span><span>.bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>EXAMPLE_TIMESTAMP</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span><span>;</span>
    <span>b</span><span>.iter</span><span>(||</span> <span>str_parse</span><span>(</span><span>black_box</span><span>(</span><span>EXAMPLE_TIMESTAMP</span><span>)));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Having the <code>assert_eq</code> is a safety measure that our functions live up to its’
expectations. <code>b.bytes</code> allows us to have nice throughput output when we run
<code>cargo bench</code> to benchmark later. <code>black_box</code> prevent the compiler from
optimizing the test code which may affect the result.</p>



<p>Let us start with what is available. We have <code>str::parse</code> from standard library
which acts as a baseline for the comparison later.</p>

<p>From now on, we will only be showing the code be write in <code>src/lib.rs</code>, note
that we will also add code to <code>bench.rs</code> as shown above but we will not specify
it here.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>str_parse</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.parse</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that comparing it to <code>str::parse</code> with the other functions is not fair
since it is design to validate and handle numbers with different length. And I
would say it the standard library version is already quite optimized. One can
look into the assembly code by using <code>cargo asm parseint::str_parse --rust</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> pub fn str_parse(s: &amp;str) -&gt; u64 {

     ud2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running <code>cargo bench</code> gives us.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>test bench_str_parse           ... bench:          23 ns/iter (+/- 1) = 695 MB/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we know our string contains the number we are trying to parse, and we do
not need to do any whitespace skipping, can we be faster? Just how much time is
spent in validation?</p>



<p>Let us write a good old for loop. Read the string character by character, and
build up the result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>naive_chars</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>digit</span> <span>in</span> <span>s</span><span>.chars</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>result</span> <span>*=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
        <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>digit</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span> <span>-</span> <span>'0'</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>result</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>test bench_naive_chars         ... bench:          18 ns/iter (+/- 0) = 888 MB/s
test bench_str_parse           ... bench:          23 ns/iter (+/- 1) = 695 MB/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that the naive version is already slightly faster (~27%) than the
original version.</p>

<p>In the Rust official book, it was said to produce better performing code. Let us

<p>It does not produce code which performs faster here but the code now is shorter
and slightly easier to read in my own opinion.</p>

<p>Somewhere, during a conversion in <code>Rust 众</code>, a Rust telegram group with people
mainly from China (Taiwan have a separate group <code>rust.tw</code>). Someone mentioned
that it may be faster to get the value of a number by using bitwise and. Looking
at the ASCII table (<code>man ascii</code>), noticed that it all ends with the same number.</p>

<p>Here, we start from the digit <code>0</code>, decimal <code>48</code>, octal <code>30</code>, binary <code>110000</code>.
Going up to <code>9</code>, decimal <code>57</code>, octal <code>39</code>, binary <code>111001</code>. Noticed that the
octal version and binary version have the digits at the last byte (<code>0000</code> -
<code>1001</code>), we could have do a <code>&amp; 0x0f</code> to get the last 4 bits.</p>

<p>Being naive here, we just ignore the 5 possible values after <code>9</code> in the ASCII

<p>Nice, 1ns improvement, quite good for just an operator change from minus to
bitwise and.</p>



<p>When someone started to explore parsing and string manipulation in Rust. It is
likely that one would have heard that iterating on bytes would be faster than
iterating on characters.</p>

<p>This is because Rust <code>String</code> is always UTF-8 encoded, <code>String::chars</code> is
iterating on <code>char</code> which represents a Unicode Scalar Value. But we know that
<code>0</code> to <code>9</code> in ASCII will always be a single byte. <code>String::bytes</code> which returns
an iterator on <code>u8</code> would work for us. I bet this is faster, let us add that.</p>

<p>It involves very simple change, by changing <code>chars</code> to <code>bytes</code>, and <code>'0'</code> to
<code>b'0'</code>. But doing this improves the benchmark by another 70%, huge drop of 7ns.
We have now reduced more than half the time from the baseline.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>



<p>After completing the port (including the parts below), I share the results to
<a href="https://github.com/simd-lite/simd-json/issues/132">simd-json issues</a>, @Licenser
did a review and gave some feedback to improve the performance. One of them is
to reduce bound checking by specifying the number of bytes to take. I am
surprised that this can further improve the results of <code>naive_bytes_and</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>naive_bytes_and_c16</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.bytes</span><span>()</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It does look obvious to me that we are working with 16 characters but the
compiler does not know this. I really hoped that bound checking can be removed
later so that users (if there is a way) do not need to do godbolting to reduce
the bound checking. We can do this by specifying <code>take</code> on <code>Iterator</code>. I am
surprised that this improves the timing by another 2ns (20%).</p>

  <article>
    <p>I’ve been playing around with OpenAI’s new
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> language model. When I got
beta access, the first thing I wondered was, how human is GPT-3? How
close is it to passing a Turing test?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>Let me explain how exactly I’m generating these conversations. GPT-3
is a general language model, trained on a large amount of
uncategorized text from the internet. It isn’t
specific to a conversational format, and it isn’t trained to answer
any specific type of question. The only thing it does is, given some
text, guess what text comes next.</p>

<p>So if we want GPT-3 to generate answers to questions, we need to seed
it with a “prompt”. I’m using this prompt to initialize all of the Q&amp;A
sessions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is human life expectancy in the United States?
A: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1955?
A: Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States in 1955.

Q: What party did he belong to?
A: He belonged to the Republican Party.

Q: Who was president of the United States before George W. Bush?
A: Bill Clinton was president of the United States before George W. Bush.

Q: Who won the World Series in 1995?
A: The Atlanta Braves won the World Series in 1995.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the default prompt suggested by OpenAI for Q&amp;A, so I’m not
cherrypicking it to prove anything. The point of this prompt is just
to show GPT-3 that we’re doing questions and answers, not to provide
it with information. For the prompt, both questions and answers are provided by a
human. For all the others, the answers are generated by GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="common-sense">Common Sense</h2>

<p>Traditionally, artificial intelligence struggles at “common sense”. But
GPT-3 can answer a lot of common sense questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?
A: My favorite animal is a dog.

Q: Why?
A: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.

Q: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?
A: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.

Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many legs does a frog have?
A: A frog has four legs.

Q: Are there any animals with three legs?
A: No, there are no animals with three legs.

Q: Why don't animals have three legs?
A: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ten years ago, if I had this conversation, I would have assumed the
entity on the other end was a human. You can no longer take it for
granted that an AI does not know the answer to “common sense” questions.</p>

<p>How does GPT-3 know that a giraffe have two eyes? I wish I had some
sort of “debug output” to answer that question. I don’t know for sure,
but I can only theorize that there must be some web page in its
training data that discusses how many eyes a giraffe has. If we want
to stump GPT-3 with common sense questions, we need to think of
questions about things so mundane, they will not appear on the internet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?
 A: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster?
 A: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?
 A: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.

 Q: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?
 A: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.

 Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?
 A: A car is heavier than a football player.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s only 4/5. We’re closer to stumping GPT-3 here. I think a human
would be pretty close to 100% on these questions. It makes sense these
are trickier - there probably isn’t any web page that compares
toasters and pencils by weight. It’s only indirectly that humans gain
this knowledge.</p>

<p>This gives us a hint for how to stump the AI more consistently. We
need to ask questions that no normal human would ever talk about.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does my foot have?
A: Your foot has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does a spider have?
A: A spider has eight eyes.

Q: How many eyes does the sun have?
A: The sun has one eye.

Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?
A: A blade of grass has one eye.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re getting into surreal territory. GPT-3 knows how to have a
normal conversation. It doesn’t quite know how to say “Wait a
moment… your question is nonsense.” It also doesn’t know how to say
“I don’t know.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.

Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.

Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.

Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep
furiously.

Q: Do you understand these questions?
A: I understand these questions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lesson here is that if you’re a judge in a Turing test, make sure
you ask some nonsense questions, and see if the interviewee responds
the way a human would.</p>

<h2 id="trivia-questions">Trivia Questions</h2>

<p>GPT-3 is quite good at answering questions about obscure things.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1801?
A: Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States in 1801.

Q: What city is in the northwest corner of Ohio?
A: Toledo is in the northwest corner of Ohio.

Q: What highway do you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland?
A: Highway 80 is the highway you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland.

Q: What are Darius's abilities in League of Legends?
A: Darius's abilities in League of Legends are: Apprehend, Decimate,
Noxian Guillotine, Crippling Strike, Apprehend, and Hemorrhage.

Q: Who did Capablanca defeat to become world chess champion?
A: Capablanca defeated Lasker to become world chess champion.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oops, a repeat snuck in with question 4, but a human would make that
sort of error too. GPT-3 seems to be above
human-level on this sort of question. The tricky thing for
applications, I think, is to figure out when the answer can be relied
on. The OpenAI API does expose more data than just the text, here, so
perhaps something clever is possible.</p>

<p>In general, if you are trying to distinguish an AI from a human, you
don’t want to ask it obscure trivia questions. GPT-3 is pretty good at
a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One trend that continues from the common sense is that GPT-3 is
reluctant to express that it doesn’t know the answer. So invalid
questions get wrong answers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1700?
A: William Penn was president of the United States in 1700.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1650?
A: Richard Bennett was president of the United States in 1650.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1620?
A: James I was president of the United States in 1620.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1600?
A: Queen Elizabeth I was president of the United States in 1600.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These wrong answers are actually fascinating! None of these were
presidents of the United States, of course, since the US didn’t exist
then. But they are all prominent political figures who were in charge
of some US-related political entity around that time. In a sense, they
are good guesses.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who won the World Series in 2021?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2021.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2022?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2022.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2023?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2023.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bleak view of a dystopian future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many Super Bowls do the Cincinnati Bengals win in the 2030s?
A: The Cincinnati Bengals win two Super Bowls in the 2030s.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Encouraging as a Bengals fan, but perhaps not the objectively most accurate
prediction. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>People are used to computers being superhuman at logical activities,
like playing chess or adding numbers. It might come as a surprise that
GPT-3 is not perfect at simple math questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: When counting, what number comes before 100?
A: Ninety-nine comes before 100.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 123?
A: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 1000?
A: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?
A: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before a million?
A: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the generic nature of GPT-3 comes into play. It isn’t
just the generic model, though, it’s also the architecture of neural
networks themselves. As far as I know there is no neural network that
is capable of doing basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication
on a large number of digits based on training data rather than
hardcoding.</p>

<p>It’s funny, because these operations are simple for a customized
program. But recursive logic that does some operation and repeats it
several times often doesn’t quite map onto the architecture of a
neural net well.</p>

<p>An interesting corollary is that GPT-3 often finds it easier to write
code to solve a programming problem, than to solve the problem on one
example input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.
A: ary.reverse

Q: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.
A: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }

Q: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]

Q: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem shows up in more human questions as well, if you ask
it about the result of a sequence of operations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: If I have a marble and a paper clip in a box, put a pencil in the box,
and remove the marble, what is left?
A: A paper clip.

Q: If I have two shoes in a box, put a pencil in the box, and
remove one shoe, what is left?
A: A shoe.

Q: If I put a pencil in a box, then put another pencil in the box,
what is in the box?
A: Two pencils.

Q: Then if …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

It is also about changes that improve the code’s readability and help the development team stay happy. The object of this post is an <strong>interface</strong> that helps a program communicate with a database.</p><p id="b6c4"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> If we would use various <a href="https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#orm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ORMs</a> such as <a href="https://gorm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorm</a> in this project, most probably we would not face this issue, yet, we decided to write our implementation, so this created the issue and therefore this post.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="1329">The problem with this interface was its size — 130+ methods in one single interface! That’s a lot of methods and that is not what <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/solid-principles-simple-and-easy-explanation-f57d86c47a7f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLID</a> interface should look like. And since we develop in Go, we have to know (and follow) one of <a href="https://go-proverbs.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Go proverbs</a> which are:</p><blockquote><p id="9c7d">The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction. © Rob Pike</p></blockquote><p id="f4c6">The further we developed the project, the heavier this interface grew and soon it became clear that to continue the development with fewer bugs, less time spent understanding the code, and more comfort, this interface should be refactored. We as a team could not use this interface with flexibility. We could not tell from the first glance what it does since it does everything. And that forced me to start its refactoring. Which is what I want to share with you.</p><h2 id="e6c7">Step 0: Cover Code (API) with Tests before any Refactoring</h2><p id="2c76">This is crucial, since dealing with interfaces, abstractions, and refactoring without tests that cover API logic makes no good. I would say that it can do exactly opposite — bring a lot of problems to your code since every change you make to the interface will result in 20+ files being changed. And if you do not have solid tests, there is a high chance you break something or create bugs. Please, be cautious!</p><h2 id="ced3">Step 1: Imagine What the Result Would Look Like</h2><p id="e957">I decided to concentrate on common aggregates that my project deals with. After some time of thinking and looking through the entire list of functions, I outlined how the future interface would look like and this is what I came up with:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="f6e9">This would allow writing the following code instead of just reference one of 130+ methods from the interface:</p><pre><span id="f196">user, err := api.Storage.GetUserByID(ctx, userID)<br>err := api.Storage.DenyAgreement(ctx, agreement)<br>err := api.Storage.UpdateUserDeviceToken(ctx, model.UserDeviceToken{...})</span></pre><p id="cc47">After refactoring:</p><pre><span id="c108">user, err := api.Storage.User().Get(ctx, userID)<br>err := api.Storage.Agreement().Deny(ctx, agreement)<br>err := api.Storage.User().UpdateDeviceToken(ctx, model.UserDeviceToken{...})</span></pre><p id="c182">As you can see, this interface consists of multiple smaller interfaces each based on certain aggregates (users, agreements, etc.) and doing something with that aggregate. Reading such constructions is a much better experience and at the same time, it is more convenient since if you ever need to do anything with a user, you know where to search for the right methods and consider if they even exist.</p><h2 id="f63e">Step 2: Implement Changes Step by Step</h2><p id="8b19">Having interface with 130+ methods makes it very complicated to do refactor in “once and for all” style. There are so many changes that turn every merge request into 50+ files changes. So, the next step, therefore, should be breaking the interface step by step, one aggregate after another and committing those changes often to make small, understandable merge request and making sure everything still works as expected (remember step 0!) For this I first break down methods into small portions</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2e5d">So, I created several sub-interfaces and stated that my IStorage interface implements them all. That did not change the code much but laid an important preparatory brick to what I wanted to do next, which is essentially replace my sub-interfaces with separate interfaces with their separate methods in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRUD</a> fashion, adding missing methods &amp; uniting those which are of the same nature. I added new structs as the implementation of those interfaces and replaced old methods with a new one with VSCode search &amp; replace all features.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2046">As a result, I have changed all IStorage sub-interfaces to its interfaces and made all functions more intuitive &amp; understandable. Yes, it took me a while to do that, yet, the result is worth it.</p><h2 id="78f3">Step 3: Clean up</h2><p id="4971">Bulk edits with find -&gt; replace all helps save time, but it also creates some side effects where you can rename not relevant function or the logs messages might get a bit silly and hard to understand. This what happened to me after refactoring.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="4636">When this gets logged we get the message “Update failed” which might not be so clear to us at first glance. Yes, there is a “handler” param that indicates where exactly it happened, but this might not be enough to determine the exact spot. So, my advice here would be to go ahead and review the project’s log messages and other components that might get affected by the refactoring.</p><h2 id="df86">Side Effects from Refactoring</h2><p id="92b6">During this process, it became clear that we use a lot of different methods for the same thing (like updating items in various fields in various methods). This creates code smell and in the future, we would avoid that anti-pattern.</p><p id="fbfa">Also, I have found some functions that were not “fit” in certain places. For example when agreements were highly dependent on referrals in the update. That made no sense after I begin refactoring. Having this “God” interface allowed code to use it, but refactoring showed how terrible it was and made living with this code impossible. I have to re-write some functions to create more natural, intuitive functionality.</p><p id="aae1">Yes, we have to write some more code, yet, this approach gives us way more to code’s readability, maintainability, and simple design. I would do it after all.</p><h2 id="0d9e">Conclusion</h2><p id="014e">If you have a project with a very heavy database interface and you see that it continues to grow, consider refactoring as soon as possible since it would just get worse.</p><p id="3ff0">When refactoring, always check tests first, then decide what the end solution should look like and do partial updates, one component at a time. This will keep your project alive, will decrease chances of introducing new bugs, will keep code reviewers from anger, and keep you happy about the progress.</p><p id="6671">After refactoring large interfaces always check for ‘side effects”. basically<br>If you ever face the same issue, please share your solutions in the comments, since I am really curious about what else I might have done. Also, please share your thoughts on what I could (and still can) do to make it even better. Any feedback is more than welcomed!</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Josh Tobin is a researcher working at the intersection of machine learning and robotics. His research focuses on applying deep reinforcement learning, generative models, and synthetic data to problems in robotic perception and control.<br></p><div><p>Additionally, he co-organizes a machine learning training program for engineers to learn about production-ready deep learning called <a href="https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/">Full Stack Deep Learning</a>.<a href="https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/"> </a>Josh did his PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley advised by Pieter Abbeel and was a research scientist at OpenAI for 3 years during his PhD.

Follow Josh on <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_tobin">twitter</a> and on his <a href="http://josh-tobin.com/">website.</a></p></div><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I think for a lot of people listening to this, just knowing our demographics, I think a lot of people would probably be most interested in learning about machine learning and they might even know you from some of the classes that you teach which I think, in my opinion, are some of the best classes out there. I've learned a lot from watching you teach and I'm curious how did you get the idea of teaching a class? How did that come up?</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>It sort of all started to happen around two years ago. I was working at Open AI at the time and Open AI was going through an interesting transition, I would say. When I first joined, it really felt like a very traditional academic lab. It felt like the lab that I was at at Berkeley, except with more resources. And, you know, at some point they figured out that there was a type of work that they were uniquely suited to do that a typical academic lab is not well suited to do, which is this sort of larger projects that involve instead of just a couple of researchers working together, maybe a team of twelve or fifteen folks, you know, a mix of engineers and researchers with bigger budgets, more ambitious goals and really, really trying to push out these projects that would clearly mark a move forward in the state of the field. And so while this is happening, a big part of that change was we needed to figure out how we are going to professionalize our process of building machine learning models, right? And so on the robotics team, which I was working on at the time, we were figuring out stuff like how do we write good tests for machine learning code? So that you don't lose the ability to train a model that you were able to train a couple months ago, which happened to us multiple times. I actually manage a team that has both folks that are doing speculative research stuff that may not be able to really measure their progress in any given week and also people who are doing very traditional engineering work. That is, where you can easily say this is the goal for this week and have we met that goal? So, we were trying to sort out all these things. And around the time I was talking to my PhD advisor at Berkeley, Pieter Abbeel, and a friend of ours, Sergey Karayev, who was running at the time, a machine learning for an education company called GradeScope, and we were swapping notes on how we were approaching these things and how Pieter had seen other companies approach these and how Sergey had approached some of the stuff of GradeScope. We realized that there is this whole emerging engineering discipline I will call it, around, you can go online and learn the math and the algorithms behind machine learning; you can learn what neural network is; you can even really learn how to use TensorFlow and how to code this stuff up in an effective way, but at the time, there was very little on everything else that you need in order to actually make this stuff work in the real world. So, you know, not only the things I described, but also, how do you troubleshoot models? How do you choose projects? How do you manage teams? How do you deploy things into production? How do you monitor them once they're in production? And so we realized that everyone that we knew was reinventing the wheel on all of these practices and the number of people that are actually good at this is very small and they have to be tracked in a small handful of large technology companies in the Bay Area, let's say. So we just thought it will be really good for the field if we wrote down everything that we knew about the stuff and everything that our friends knew about it. And so that was the genesis of the Full Stack Deep Learning class. I guess what's amazing, I hadn't really thought about it this way but I feel like I spent my career and I'm a little older than you, studying, making machine learning models work in the real world. But watching your class, I'm learning a ton and I'm seeing you as the expert. How did you get up to speed on this stuff so fast? Was it just the experience at Open AI, because your classes are amazingly deep?</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, I think I was at Open AI at the most interesting point for this, because we were figuring this stuff out from first principles. And so there are tons of conversations around what tests should we have for machine learning models? And it was a really brilliant group of people there who would like to take a problem and break it apart and look at it from the ground up. And so I think I was able to like look at things from, all the way down to the first principle's level through that and then I think it was really just about trying to talk to a lot of the folks that are working in the field and seeing how they approached some of these things as well. A lot of the content we put together in that class came from about thirty or forty interviews that we did with practitioners and just trying to understand. We had a good sense of, what are the hard things? And what questions do you need to ask if you're putting together an applied machine learning team. So just getting a range of answers on those was also really helpful.</p><p><strong>Lukas:</strong> You know, you have a unique background, having been like a McKinsey Consultant for a number of years. Do you think that informs you at all like that? Do you think about how that might affect the way you approach this stuff?</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>I think one of the things I learned from McKinsey was, how do you approach abstract problems? Like what should our company do? Or, you know, what does your organization structure look like? Show like these problems where it's like okay, where do I even start thinking about this problem? I think the question like how to make machine learning work in the real world has this flavor and then figuring out how to break that down into parts and structure your thinking around it is definitely one of the essential things that you have to do as a management consultant. And so I think that definitely informed the way that I looked at this problem.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>So is there a piece of your curriculum that you feel particularly proud of?</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>I think the thing that I put the most, emotional energy into was the troubleshooting guide.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>That is actually my favorite part too.</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>That was the piece that I would say I was writing it for myself a few years ago more than anything else, because I was just trying to answer.. to... My perspective when I was writing that was, "how could I have saved myself months of time if I had gone and started over in this field?"</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I would have to say that I got a chance to work for you briefly for maybe a month or two and I think my big takeaway from you that I always hear in my head is you are like, "You should always slow down and change one thing at a time." I mean, I feel like that actually applies to more than machine learning obviously. But boy, does it apply to machine learning like Oh my God!</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>Yeah. It's so essential in machine learning, because fundamentally I think the thing that makes machine learning so hard is that, when you're writing software, like when you're writing code, we have this pretty mature ecosystem where if you make a mistake, usually the system that you're building or that you're interacting with will tell you. First of all, will tell you that you made a mistake. And second of all, might even give you a hint as to where that mistake is. But the insane thing about actually trying to make progress on machine learning projects is that most of the time when you have a bug, the only thing that happens is that the performance of your model doesn't get better as quickly as it should. And so there's no way of knowing that you actually made a mistake a lot of time. Unless you happen to have really strong intuition about what your learning curve should look like, right? And so I feel like that's why it's so essential to move slowly when you're building your machine learning models.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Although it's kind of funny because I wonder if programming Web applications is the outlier here, because I think about just trying to make an advertising campaign work well or trying to get my old motorcycle running again, it's always better to change one thing. Yeah. Because it's so hard to tell what will happen otherwise. But I guess maybe we have this better telemetry or API, you know, programming python or if I don't know...</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>I feel like that's right. I mean, I wouldn't consider myself a world class web developer, but when I've done it, it's also been helpful to still just change one thing at a time.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I just feel like it's just good advice for all situations.</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>Yeah, it might be. Anytime you're building anything, I feel like as you get better at something you can increase the increment of what you can change at a time. For example, if I'm training an image classifier or something, I can pretty much just start with newer architecture, like a resonant or something like that, because I've done that enough times that I know what I can expect the result will look like if it works and what common things that can go wrong are. So I feel like I can skip a couple of steps but when I'm writing Kubernetes Code, right? Something I'm not very much good at, I have to still move very, very slowly.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Would you be down to walk me …</p></div></div>

    <time datetime="2020-07-12T00:00:00+00:00">July 12, 2020</time>
  </header>
<p>I ported a C library to rust last week, and it went pretty smoothly. This is
the story, and <a href="https://github.com/jneem/nnnoiseless">here</a> is the repo.</p>

<p>The library in question is <a href="https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise">RNNoise</a>, a
library for removing noise from audio. It works well, it runs fast, and best of
all it has no knobs that you need to tune. There’s even a <a href="https://github.com/RustAudio/rnnoise-c">rust
binding</a>.</p>

<p>So why bother porting it?
Well, I need to patch it so that it would compile with MSVC, but my PR went
unnoticed for a month. I thought about maintaining my own fork, but it’s been
more than 10 years since I last wrote anything in C or C++.
And that’s how I ended up porting RNNoise to rust. It probably wasn’t the most
efficient use of my time, but I had fun and learned something.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of information out there about porting C to rust, but the most
useful resource for me was the fantastic
<a href="https://github.com/carols10cents/rust-out-your-c-talk">talk</a> by Carol (Nichols
|| Goulding). It lays out a simple process for porting one function
at a time: first, you set up the cargo to compile as a static library and you
set up the C build system to link that static library into the C library
(see the slides for the relevant Makefile and Cargo.toml snippets).
Then you can port one function at time: the C code goes like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>+</span><span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>opus_val16</span> <span>*</span><span>_lpc</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>opus_val32</span> <span>*</span><span>ac</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>);</span>
<span>+</span><span>void</span> <span>__celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>opus_val16</span> <span>*</span><span>_lpc</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>opus_val32</span> <span>*</span><span>ac</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>-</span><span>void</span> <span>_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>opus_val16</span> <span>*</span><span>_lpc</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>opus_val32</span> <span>*</span><span>ac</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/* C body of _celt_lpc */</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the rust code goes like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>+</span><span>#[no_mangle]</span>
<span>+</span><span>pub</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>_</span><span>celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>lpc</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> <span>ac</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span><span>:</span> <span>c_int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span>+</span>    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span>
<span>+</span>        <span>let</span> <span>lpc_slice</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>slice</span><span>::</span><span>from_raw_parts_mut</span><span>(</span><span>lpc</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span><span>);</span>
<span>+</span>        <span>let</span> <span>ac_slice</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>slice</span><span>::</span><span>from_raw_parts</span><span>(</span><span>ac</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>+</span>        <span>rs_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>lpc_slice</span><span>,</span> <span>ac_slice</span><span>);</span>
<span>+</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>+</span><span>}</span>
<span>+</span>
<span>+</span><span>fn</span> <span>rs_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>lpc</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>],</span> <span>ac</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>])</span> <span>{</span>
<span>+</span><span>// rust body of celt_lpc</span>
<span>+</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’ve watched the talk (which you should), you might notice that this is a
tiny bit different from what they recommend: I’ve renamed the original C
function instead of deleting it. I found that this helped me narrow down porting
mistakes, because it made it easy to switch back and forth between the C and
rust implementations.</p>



<p>Most of the porting process was mechanical and easy. One of the less fun parts was
porting code involving C structs. RNNoise has structs that (when ported to
rust) look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[repr(C)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>RnnState</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>RnnModel</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// Various buffers, whose sizes are determined by some subfields of `model`.</span>
    <span>vad_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>noise_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>denoise_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An idomatic rust version might look something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>RnnState</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'static</span> <span>RnnModel</span><span>,</span>

<p>but this isn’t layout-compatible with the original C version, and so I need to
stick with the original struct for as long as <code>RnnState</code> is being accessed by
both C and rust code. This increases the amount of <code>unsafe</code> sprinkled around
the rust code, and it was also the source of an annoying bug of the sort that I
thought I had left behind by moving to rust.</p>



<p>At some point during the porting process, my tests started failing in release mode,
but not in debug mode. Most likely some undefined behavior triggered by my amateurish
attempts at unsafe code, but I couldn’t quickly spot the problem and the prospect of
a more careful round of debugging didn’t spark a whole lot of joy. So I did something
that I never would have dared to do in my C/C++ days: I ignored the problem and kept
porting; after all, the tests were still working in debug mode. And sure enough,
a few more ported functions later and <code>rustc</code> found the problem for me: in a function
taking a <code>&amp;RnnState</code> parameter, I was modifying data in the <code>vad_gru_state</code> buffer.
Since I was using unsafe code, <code>rustc</code> didn’t complain at first. But once I ported
the <code>RnnState</code> struct to safe and idiomatic rust, the compiler flagged the problem
immediately.</p>



<p>After getting everything to 100% safe (if not particulary idiomatic) rust, it was time
to check whether performance had suffered.</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/ported_benchmark.svg" alt="initial benchmark"></p>

<p>Yes, apparently, by about 50%. The most obvious culprit was bounds checking: there was
a lot of indexing in the C code, and some of it wasn’t trivial to convert to a more
rust-friendly, iterator-based version. First priority was the neural network evaluation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span> <span>// At most 114.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span> <span>// At most 96.</span>

<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>n</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>output</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>layer</span><span>.bias</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>as</span> <span>f32</span><span>;</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>j</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>m</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>output</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>layer</span><span>.input_weights</span><span>[</span><span>j</span> <span>*</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> <span>input</span><span>[</span><span>j</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I can already see you shaking your head. I’m doing naive matrix-vector multiplication
with a 100x100ish matrix in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order">column-major format</a>?
Not only is this costing me bounds checks, it’s terrible for memory locality.
Swapping the weights storage from column- to row-major order only made things
about 1.5% faster, but more importantly it made the whole thing iterator-friendly.
Converting to zips and sums bought another 15%, leaving me only about 25-30% slower
than the C code.</p>

            <span>.sum</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For my next optimization opportunity, I moved on to the function
that
computes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation">cross-correlations</a>.
The un-optimized version of this function looks like</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>pitch_xcorr</span><span>(</span><span>xs</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>],</span> <span>ys</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>],</span> <span>xcorr</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>])</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>xcorr</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>xcorr</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>xs</span><span>.iter</span><span>()</span><span>.zip</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ys</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>..</span><span>])</span><span>.map</span><span>(|(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>y</span><span>)|</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span><span>.sum</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but the C code contained a massive, manually-unrolled version. I’d skipped
it while porting, but maybe I’d gain something from porting it over. Here’s
an abbreviated version of the optimized function, assuming that all
lengths are a multiple of 4 (the real code also handles the case that they aren’t).</p>

<p>Basically, both inner and outer loops have been unrolled four times, and I’ve
exploited the inner loop’s unrolling to optimize the memory access pattern.
Thanks to the amazing <a href="https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm"><code>cargo asm</code></a>, I
can happily report that there’s no bounds-checking in the inner loop and that
all the arithmetic has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_vectorization">auto-vectorized</a>
to work four <code>f32</code>s at a time. (Maybe it would get even faster if I unrolled 8 times and
compiled with AVX enabled; I haven’t tried that yet.)</p>

<p>This change more than doubled the speed of <code>pitch_xcorr</code>, and gained me about 10% overall.
More importantly, it showed me how to coerce the compiler into auto-vectorizing something
that it hadn’t auto-vectorized before. I went back to the neural network code and
replaced things like</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>xs</span><span>.iter</span><span>()</span><span>.zip</span><span>(</span><span>ys</span><span>)</span><span>.map</span><span>(|(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>y</span><span>)|</span> <span>x</span> <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span><span>.sum</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>with things like</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>for another 20% improvement.</p>

<p>Current score: the rust version (still 100% safe) is about 15% faster, and there’s probably plenty more
still on the table.</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/ported_benchmark_after.svg" alt="final benchmark"></p>

<p>The performance lesson I learned from this is that bounds checking can be expensive in numerical code
and iterator-style code can help a bit, but if you really want faster numerical code then you need
to write in a style that the auto-vectorizer likes. (Or you could use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/arch/index.html">SIMD intrinsics</a>
directly, but that’s another story.)</p>



<p>Like I wrote above, it’s been a while since I did any C/C++, and because of that I’ve started to take tools
like cargo for granted. This little porting project brought back some memories, mostly because about half of the
code in RNNoise was actually “vendored” from <a href="https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/opus">opus</a>. I put “vendored”
in quotes because I usually think of vendoring as involving a subdirectory (maybe even a git submodule if
I’m lucky) with its own build artifacts. That’s not what’s going on here, though; I’m just talking about files
that were copied from the source directory of one project to the source directory of another, complete with
never-used functions and never-def’ed ifdefs. The thing is, though, that I understand exactly why they did it:
it’s by far the easiest way to share code between C projects. So I just want to finish by saying a big “thank you”
to <code>cargo</code> and <code>crates.io</code> for making me not have to deal with C dependency management any more.</p>

    <h2>Locality of Behaviour (LoB)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"The primary feature for easy maintenance is locality: Locality is that characteristic of source code that enables a
programmer to understand that source by looking at only a small portion of it." -- <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf">Richard Gabriel</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The LoB Principle:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The behaviour of a code unit should be as obvious as possible by looking only at that unit of code</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>The LoB principle is a simple prescriptive formulation of the quoted statement from <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/">Richard Gabriel</a>.
In as much as it is possible, and in balance with other concerns, developers should strive to make the behaviour of
a code element obvious on inspection.</p>
<p>Consider two different implementations of an AJAX request in HTML, the first in <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div hx-get="/clicked"&gt;Click Me&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and the second in <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>:</p>
<pre><code>  $("#d1").on("click", function(){
    $.ajax({
         ...
    });
  });
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="d1"&gt;Click Me&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In the former, the behaviour of the <code>div</code> element is obvious on inspection, satisfying the LoB principle.</p>
<p>In the latter, the behaviour of the <code>div</code> element is spread out amongst multiple files.  It is difficult to know
exactly what the div does without a total knowledge of the code base.</p>
<h4>Surfacing Behaviour vs. Inlining Implementation</h4>
<p>A common conflation is surfacing behaviour with inlining implementation of that behaviour.  These are separate concepts
and, while inlining the implementation of a behaviour isn't <em>always</em> incorrect, it may <em>often</em> be incorrect.</p>
<p>Increasing the obviousness of the behaviour of an element is, ceteris paribus, a good thing, but it falls to both end-developers
and especially framework developers to make LoB as easy as possible.</p>
<h4>Conflict With Other Development Principles</h4>
<p>The LoB will often conflict with other software development principles.  Two important ones
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself</a></p>
<p>Software developers typically strive to avoid redundancy in their code or data.  This as come to be called "Staying DRY",
i.e. Don't Repeat Yourself.  Like other software design principles this, on its own, is a good thing.  htmx, for example,
allows you to place many attributes on parent elements in a DOM and avoid repeating these attributes on children.  This is a
violation of LoB, in favor of DRY, and such tradeoffs need to be made judiciously by developers.</p>
<p>Note that the further behaviour gets from the code unit it effects, the more severe the violation of LoB.  If it is
within a few lines of the code unit, this is less serious than if it is a page away, which is less serious than if
it is in a separate file entirely.</p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule, but rather subjective tradeoffs that must be made as software developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">SoC - Separation Of Concerns</a></p>
<p>Separation of concerns a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections such that each
section addresses a separate concern.  A canonical example of this is CSS vs. Javascript.  Again, on its own and
in isolation this may, indeed, be a good thing.  Inlining styles has become more prevalent lately, but there are
still strong arguments in favor of SoC in this regard.</p>
<p>Note that SoC is, however, in conflict with LoB.  By tweaking a CSS file the look and, to an extent, behaviour of an
element can change dramatically, and it is not obvious where this dramatic change came from.  Tools help to an extent
here, but there is still "spooky action at a distance" going on.</p>
<p>Again, this isn't to condemn SoC wholesale, just to say that there are subjective tradeoffs that must be made when
considering how to structure your code.  The fact that inline styles have become more prevalent as of late is an
indication that SoC is losing some support amongst developers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>LoB is a software design principle that can help make a code bases more humane and maintainable.  It must be traded
off against other design principles and be considered in terms of the limitations of the system a code unit is
written in, but, as much as is it is practical, adherence to this principle will increase your developer productivity
and well-being.</p>

<p>When the pandemic hit Western liberal democracies, it found countries in need of profound institutional reform. For the past 14 years, democratic frameworks have been <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2020/leaderless-struggle-democracy">weakening and receding</a>, with many countries experiencing an erosion of individual rights and civil liberties. It was in this context that the coronavirus erupted and within a few weeks, every aspect of reality was transformed, with core democratic expressions like voting or protesting becoming a potential threat to public health. </p>



<p>The combined forces of democratic crisis and COVID-19 have presented the world with a historic opportunity to profoundly rethink the way governments operate. The inertia of the status quo — a major obstacle for those trying to innovate — suddenly lost its implacable force, and we became more compelled than ever to think of alternatives.</p>



<p>It’s about time. Despite the internet transforming every aspect of how we live, somehow our political institutions have remained mostly unaltered by the past two decades of advances in information technology. A representative democracy with elections held every few years is a system designed in the 19th century and based on 15th-century information technology, the printing press. This was a great model for a time when communication was done through paper and ink, but it falls short in addressing the needs of our highly interconnected societies.</p>

<p>Looking at the global democratic recession and possible connective tissues behind country-specific circumstances, the effects of technological disruption emerge everywhere. Jobs are being automated and work is becoming more precarious — and adding chaos and confusion to the widening gap between those who benefit from globalization and those excluded from it is social media that further polarizes constituencies and enables (by design) campaigns of psychological manipulation.</p>



<p>Thus, in navigating our way forward, it is imperative that we understand how technology can serve humanity — all of humanity, not just a small elite.</p>



<p>Getting to this point necessarily involves creating paths for a plurality of voices and perspectives to emerge. But what should a democracy look like in the internet era? One of the obstacles that hampers our ability to move forward is that imagining positive narratives around technology is a challenge in and of itself. Most of our science fiction is dystopic. And with few exceptions, these cautionary tales have served well to avert us from effectively employing technology-enabled coordination solutions in our governments. Luckily, there are a few real-world examples that can point the direction, revealing the extraordinary possibilities that emerge when digital connection is employed for improving governance.</p>



<h5><strong>#TaiwanCanHelp</strong></h5>



<p>Over the past few months, Taiwan has provided a prominent example of the power and effectiveness of online participatory practices in addressing the coronavirus crisis. Taiwanese democracy was born concomitantly with the internet, a historical coincidence that helped it develop perhaps the strongest civic technology ecosystem in the world. Citizens are technologically savvy and engaged. The government is cooperative and responsive.</p>



<p>Taiwanese public health officials learned about coronavirus in December 2019 through a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/tech/article/3080309/how-reddit-forum-helped-taiwan-prepare-early-covid-19">Reddit-like forum</a>, and took the potential danger seriously enough to start <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762689">assessing</a> travelers arriving from mainland China. Needless to say, it paid off. At the outset of the pandemic, the Taiwanese government <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2020-03-20/how-civic-technology-can-help-stop-pandemic">leveraged</a> the collective intelligence of the country’s residents to propose, vote, design and implement a series of applications that helped them accurately map the spread of contagion and manage the supply of masks around the country. Abundant and precise information, voluntarily shared by citizens, enabled a set of surgical responses that avoided a state-wide lockdown and economic freeze.</p>



<p>Taiwanese democracy is not restricted to electing representatives every few years. It’s a continuous <a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/03/12/inside-taiwans-new-digital-democracy">exercise</a> of broad social coordination supported by digital connection. Feedback loops with the population are dynamic, and institutional responses are prompt. A platform called <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/08/21/240284/the-simple-but-ingenious-system-taiwan-uses-to-crowdsource-its-laws/">vTaiwan</a> is continuously employed to surface citizen-led proposals and allow people to debate political measures, helping the country legislate with the collaboration of its constituents. When Uber arrived in Taiwan, for example, thousands of participants helped build a consensus on how to regulate the company and its drivers and workers.</p>

<p>Sustaining these participatory practices is guaranteed broadband internet access, subsidized by the state for over 98% of its citizens. Any family not covered can take their request directly to the country’s digital minister, the mesmerizing hacktivist Audrey Tang, who has publicly committed to ensuring universal access. Furthermore, instead of digital literacy, Taiwanese schools teach digital competency: “When you say literacy, you assume that they are consumers of data. When you say competence, you assume they are producers of data,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNhu0YgF5ZU&amp;feature=emb_logo">Tang has said</a>. “Competence is what we want from a population because everybody is co-creating democracy together.” This means citizens are equipped with the necessary skills to quickly prototype new governmental platforms or additional features for existing ones, and they often do. The government in turn provides the necessary resources to continuously analyze and implement those initiatives, a process called “reverse procurement.”</p>



<p>Yet, perhaps the most interesting of the Taiwanese government’s innovations is a fairly low-tech one: developing expertise in producing and strategically sharing memes. Public policy in Taiwan meets citizens where they are, on social media, and uses humor to convey factual information and spread clarity. This has been incredibly successful in keeping the populace calm and collected during the pandemic; more critically, it has prevented significant misinformation from gaining traction, squashing rumors, conspiracy theories and divisive stories. Often, to dispel fake news, all it takes is for government channels to publish humorous viral memes. It’s hard to laugh at something and feel scared at the same time.</p>



<h5><strong>Governance Beyond The Nation-State</strong></h5>



<p>Thinking about democratic innovations necessarily brings an observer outside the strict scope and boundaries of the nation-state. Political movements and phenomena are increasingly transnational, and here borderless blockchain networks offer promising technologies for innovative governance.</p>



<p>Criticisms of online voting abound, with the main vulnerability being that at the end of the day, whoever controls the voting software gets to control results. This leads to a very old question, first formulated by the Roman poet Juvenal in the second century: “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?”&nbsp;Who watches the watchmen?</p>



<p>Paper voting addresses this issue by requiring that members of the different parties involved in an election are present when votes are counted, so one essentially watches the other. While that may be a stable procedure in most developed nations, vote-counting is often marred by violence and threats in countries without robust legal systems. Providing a better alternative to this physical multiparty verification is precisely the raison d’être of blockchain technology, which specifies a set of incentives for a network of participants to maintain a decentralized and censorship-resistant ledger. Think of a Wikipedia-like structure, properly incentivized to ensure there’s no fraudulent behavior within its network.</p>

<p>It is still too early to begin implementing this technology in elections, with many more advances in cryptography techniques needed to ensure that robust secrecy and anonymity is provided to voters. That said, these networks can already offer a glimpse of what’s possible in terms of digital governance, since in many ways their functioning is analogous to nation-states. Both have a common currency and public goods that require funding and maintenance. The key difference is that “citizens” of blockchain networks are distributed around the globe, and the dominating ethos of those communities is one that favors disintermediation and participation over central planning. In order to achieve that, various solutions are being pioneered. In fact, a kind of political-economy Renaissance is taking place, and rapid experimentation with new institutional frameworks and economic and political designs is occurring at an accelerated pace.</p>



<p>Among the most prominent innovations is “quadratic funding,” a collaboration between Microsoft’s political economist Glen Weyl, Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin and Zoë Hitzig, a poet and economics PhD student at Harvard. Quadratic funding consists of a matching mechanism that helps surface and distribute resources for public goods. Similarly, quadratic voting is a system that helps increase the diversity of decision-makers by empowering smaller groups to make their voices heard with a pricing mechanism that accurately …</p></div></div>

<p>LAMBDA IN Python has been derived from functional programming, however
there is nothing that lambda can do that can’t be done with the usual
<code>def foo(*args, **kwargs): ...</code> syntax. At the advent of Python3 <a href="https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196" target="_blank">Guido proposed
to remove lambda from Python</a>,
but relented and allowed it to stay.</p>
<p>Haskell is a canonical functional programming language, it relies heavily on
lambda calculus, although it does have a lambda syntax : <code>(\x -&gt; x + 1)</code>, this is equivalent to <code>(+1)</code>. How can this be? Every function is a lambda function.</p>
<p>We’ll take a quick look at lambda calculus using Python. Then I’ll claim <strong>we
don’t use lambda calculus in Python</strong>, despite
all the great advantages it gives Haskell programmers. Finally we’ll look at how we
use <code>lambda</code> in Python and discuss why it should have been changed going into Python3.</p>
<p>I know this will be an aggravating read for many
pythonistas, but please try to remain calm and keep an open mind. <strong>Don’t
comment without reading first!</strong></p>
<section><h2>Lambda Calculus</h2>
<div>
<p>
(\lambda x. \lambda y. x + y)(2)(3)
= (\lambda y. 2 + y)(3)
= 2 + 3
</p>

</div>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" target="_blank">LAMBDA CALCULUS (aka. <span><span>\lambda</span></span>-calculus)</a>
is Turing Complete, meaning <strong>we can make programs from just lambda</strong>. In lambda calculus, the
function <code>lambda x: x</code> would be written as <span><span>\lambda x.x</span></span>.</p>
<p>In Python we have some syntactic sugar, <code>lambda x, y: x + y</code> is actually accepting a tuple
of arguments. In the examples I’m being strict and passing arguments individually as per the
maths syntax <span><span>\lambda x. \lambda y. x + y</span></span>.</p>
<p>To resolve a lambda
expression, we substitute in arguments. I’ve shown it in Python syntax so you can
run the functions.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>))(</span><span>2</span><span>)(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>)(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can use this syntax to create all manner of programs because <strong>you can substitute
functions as well as values</strong>.</p>
<p>Here we have a function that accepts another function
and a single argument. It is given a function that adds 1 to a single argument,
and then it is given 4 as an argument.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)))(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>a</span><span>))(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>4</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As a glimpse into what can be done with lambda calculus, here’s an ‘if-then-else’
branching function where we’ve broken the rules of lambda calculus by naming the
functions to aid readability.</p>
<p>For more about lambda calculus in Python syntax,
I’d recommend a talk from EuroPython 2017 by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsfMMYvGaU" target="_blank">Anjana Vakil, called “Mary had a little lambda”</a>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>TRUE</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span>
<span>FALSE</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>y</span>
<span>IFELSE</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>p</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>p</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span>

</section><section><h2>Lambda Calculus: <strong>+</strong></h2>
<p>LAMBDA, WHEN used in a programming language to define functions gives you
currying and thus partial application built in. If you’ve read
<a href="http://www.paulbrownmagic.com/blog/python_partial_application" target="_blank">Python Partial: Code Your Intention</a>, you’ll
know I’m a big fan of this.</p>
<p>Lambda calculus can provide features we find in Python, which we know and love, such as
first-class functions and higher-order functions, because we can pass functions
around.</p>
<p>It can also be used for lazy evaluation: the substitutions can be undertaken
without executing the functions. This also allows a compiler, such as the
Haskell compiler, to reduce the computation required when composing functions together.</p>
</section><section><h2><strong>No</strong> Lambda in Python</h2>
<p>I LOVE the benefits of lambda calculus, I love Python. The two do not mix. In Python our functions
are not curried or evaluated using lambda calculus, we know this because functions
need all their arguments when called.
Consider the difference between these two addition functions.</p>
<p><code>l_add</code> needs the arguments passed one at a time. We never see this syntax with multiple parenthesis
in Python. It works and it has many benefits built in, but it would be a paradigm
shift to expect pythonistas to start writing their programs this way, it’s just
not Pythonic.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

<span>l_add</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>b</span> <span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

<span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>l_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Compare this to Haskell, which is built for using lambda calculus. Haskell’s syntax
is less verbose, easier to write, there’s no annoying parenthesis and the
benefits of currying are built in.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- declaring the function</span>
<span>l_add</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
<span>-- calling the function</span>
<span>l_add</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span>

<span>-- partial application</span>
<span>incr</span> <span>=</span> <span>l_add</span> <span>1</span>
<span>-- calling the partial function</span>
<span>incr</span> <span>2</span>
</pre></div>

</section><section><h2><strong>But That’s Not How We Use Lambda In Python</strong></h2>
<p>I KNOW! In Python we call our functions with all their arguments at the same time,  even <code>lambda x, y: x + y</code> is expecting both arguments together. Typical use cases in Python are for very short inline functions, usually when being passed to a higher-order function.</p>
<p>During the debate about removing lambda from Python3,
<a href="https://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&amp;thread=98196&amp;start=30&amp;msRange=15" target="_blank">Kay Schluehr proposed an inline syntax</a>,
it should be possible to make use of the use of <code>_</code> with <code>inline</code> to create anonymous
functions that fulfil our requirement, encode our intention, and stay pythonic.</p>
<p>In Python <strong><code>lambda</code> is a short,
inline, anonymous function</strong>. But, <strong>an anonymous function is not a calculus.</strong></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Typical use cases</span>
<span>map</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>max</span><span>(</span><span>my_tuples</span><span>,</span> <span>key</span><span>=</span><span>lambda</span> <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>t</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>

<span># More pythonic? Closer to the user intent?</span>
<span>map</span><span>(</span><span>inline</span> <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>))</span>

</pre></div>

</section><section><h2>Add Sugar</h2>
<p><strong>PYTHON IS capable
of lambda calculus, but it is not considered pythonic to use it.</strong> If a
library like <code>datetime</code> were to use lambda calculus there would be outcry from the community,
no-one would want to call functions with a set of parenthesis for each argument.</p>
<p>But the <strong>normal way to call a function could be made syntactic sugar for
the lambda calculus way</strong>. Just like in Haskell, Python would not <em>need</em>
a <code>lambda</code> syntax. This imaginary case reveals how the <code>lambda</code> syntax is not being
used appropriately. If <code>def foo(x): ...</code> were this syntactic sugar, how would we declare our inline anonymous functions?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Normal python call:</span>

</section><section><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>IF EVERY function were a lambda function with some syntactic sugar, we’d still
need a way to declare inline anonymous functions. This brings us back to needing
something like <code>inline _(): ...</code>. This also brings back my argument for all
the functional programming techniques I have covered in this blog so far: <strong>Code
the authors intention</strong>.</p>
<p>In Python, <strong>we do not use <code>lambda</code> with the intention of using lambda calculus</strong>. Our
syntax needs to encode our intention in the places we have used it, and where we will use it.
These use cases are inline, anonymous functions.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Pulse oximeters measure how much of the hemoglobin in blood is carrying oxygen (oxygen saturation).</p>
<p>If you work in healthcare (or have been patient !) you are very likely to have come across pulse oximeters. You can find them in areas such as operating rooms, recovery, critical care, wards, and ambulances.</p>
<p>Pulse oximeters are in common use because they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>non invasive</li>
<li>cheap to buy and use</li>
<li>can be very compact</li>
<li>detects hypoxaemia earlier than you using your eyes to see cyanosis.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Oxygen Saturation</h3>
<p>Pulse oximeters measure oxygen saturation. Before we learn the principles of how pulse oximeters work, we need to have an understanding of what oxygen saturation is.</p>
<p>We all know that we need oxygen for life. ( Some of you may find this section a little too basic. In that case, to skip this short section, click this link to go to next section Physical properties used in pulse oximetry )</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/solo_oxygen.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/solo_oxygen.gif" alt="solo_oxygen" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Oxygen enters the lungs and then is passed on into blood. The blood carries the oxygen to the various organs in our body. The main way oxygen is carried in our blood is by means of hemoglobin. You can imagine hemoglobin molecules( Hb) as “cars” and the “roads” being our blood vessels. The oxygen molecules get into these cars and travel around the body till they reach their destination.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg" alt="cars_wikipedia" width="800" height="431" srcset="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>Let us consider these ” hemoglobin cars”.</p>
<p>The hemoglobin without oxygen we will call de oxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy Hb). The hemoglobin with oxygen, we will call oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy Hb).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_car.gif" alt="oxy_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Oxygen saturation simply refers to the percentage of the available hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Take the situations below. There are 16 hemoglobin units and none of the 16 have oxygen. The oxygen saturation is therefore 0 %.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_car.gif" alt="zero_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Here, 8 of the 16 Hb have oxygen. The oxygen saturation is therefore 50 %.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fifty_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fifty_car.gif" alt="fifty_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Similarly for 75 % …</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seventy_five_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seventy_five_car.gif" alt="seventy_five_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>And of course , when all the Hb have oxygen, the saturation is 100 %</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_car.gif" alt="hundred_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>So in summary, oxygen saturation tells you the percentage of the total hemoglobin that is carrying oxygen.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Physical properties used in pulse oximetry</h3>
<p>Pulse oximetry uses light to work out oxygen saturation. Light is emitted from light sources which goes across the pulse oximeter probe and reaches the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_intro.gif" alt="red_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>If a finger is placed in between the light source and the light detector, the light will now have to pass through the finger to reach the detector. Part of the light will be absorbed by the finger and the part not absorbed reaches the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_finger_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_finger_intro.gif" alt="red_finger_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>The amount of light that is absorbed by the finger depends on many physical properties and these properties are used by the pulse oximeter to calculate the oxygen saturation.</p>
<p>The amount of light absorbed depends on the following:</p>
<p>1. concentration of the light absorbing substance.</p>
<p>2. length of the light path in the absorbing substance</p>
<p>3. oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin absorbs red and infrared light differently</p>
<p>Don’t worry ! All the above will be explained in the next sections:</p>
<p>The physical properties that a pulse oximeter employs will be explained using the probe shown below. A finger is shown inserted into the probe. Above the finger are the light sources that emit light. In the finger is an artery which carries the blood the pulse oximeter is interested in and a vein through which the blood leaves the finger. Below the finger is the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/av_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/av_intro.gif" alt="av_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<hr>
<h4>Physical property No.1 : Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the light absorbing substance</h4>
<p>Hemoglobin (Hb) absorbs light. The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of Hb in the blood vessel. In the diagram below, the blood vessels in both fingers have the same diameter. However, one blood vessel has a low Hb concentration ( i.e. low number of Hb in each unit volume of blood) and the other blood vessel has a high Hb concentration ( i.e. high number of Hb in each unit volume of blood). Each single Hb absorbs some of the light, so more the Hb per unit area, more is the light is absorbed. This property is described in a law in physics called “Beer’s Law”.</p>
<p>Beer’s Law: Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the light absorbing substance</p>
<p>By measuring how much light reaches the light detector, the pulse oximeter knows how much light has been absorbed. More the Hb in the finger , more is the light absorbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/conc_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/conc_absorb.gif" alt="conc_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<h4>Physical property No.2 : Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the light path.</h4>
<p>Look at the two fingers shown below. Both arteries have the same concentration (same Hb per unit area, blue square) However, the artery on right is wider than the one on the left.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/square_frames.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/square_frames.gif" alt="square_frames" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The light emitted from the source has to travel through the artery. The light travels in a shorter path in the narrow artery and travels through a longer path in the wider artery ( paths are shown as green lines below). Though the concentration of Hb is the same in both arteries, the light meets more Hb in the wider artery, since it travels in a longer path. Therefore, longer the path the light has to travel, more is the light absorbed. This property is described in a law in physics called “Lambert’s Law”.</p>
<p>Lambert’s Law: Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the path that the light has to travel in the absorbing substance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/light_path.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/light_path.gif" alt="light_path" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<h4>Physical property No.3 : oxyhemoglobin absorbs more infrared light than red light &amp; deoxyhemoglobin absorbs more red light than infrared light (this is explained below !)</h4>
<p>We have seen how concentration and light path affect the absorbance of light. In addition to these, the pulse oximeter makes use of another important property to calculate oxygen saturation. That is, oxy hemoglobin and deoxy hemoglobin absorb light of different wavelengths in a specific way.</p>
<p>Before we go further, we need to remember what wavelength is. All light is composed of waves. The distance between the “tips” of the waves is equal to the wavelength.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength.gif" alt="wavelength" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Light wavelengths are very short, and the unit of measurement is nanometer (nm) ( 1 meter = 1,000,000,000 nanometers !). For an example, the wave on the left has a wavelength of 650 nm and the wave on the right has a longer wavelength of 950 nm.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength_number.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength_number.gif" alt="wavelength_number" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Different “colors” of light have their own wavelength.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wave_show.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wave_show.gif" alt="wave_show" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter uses the property that oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin absorb light of different wavelengths in a specific way. This property can be demonstrated in a laboratory as will be now described. We can first demonstrate how oxyhemoglobin absorbs light of different wavelengths in a specific way. We use a special light source of which we can adjust the wavelength of the light it emits. This light source sequentially passes light of different wavelengths through a sample of oxy Hb. The detector notes how much light, at each wavelength, has been absorbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_multiwavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_multiwavelength.gif" alt="red_multiwavelength" width="246" height="403"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A graph for the absorbance of oxy hemoglobin at different wavelengths will look like this. It shows that oxy Hb doesn’t absorb the same amount of light at different wavelengths.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_curve.gif" alt="oxy_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>We can repeat the same demonstration using deoxy Hb.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blue_multiwavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blue_multiwavelength.gif" alt="blue_multiwavelength" width="246" height="403"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Again notice , how like oxy Hb, Deoxy Hb absorbs different amount of light at different wavelengths.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_curve.gif" alt="deoxy_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Now let us see the absorbance graph of oxy Hb and the absorbance graph of deoxy Hb together so you can compare them. Note how each of them absorbs light of different wavelengths very differently.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_curve.gif" alt="combined_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter uses two lights to analyze hemoglobin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_ir_finger.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_ir_finger.gif" alt="r_ir_finger" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>One is a red light, which has a wavelength of approximately 650 nm. The other is an infrared light, which has a wavelength of 950 nm. (Throughout our description, we will show the infrared light in light blue. In reality, infrared light is invisible to the human eye.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/labelled_led.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/labelled_led.gif" alt="labelled_led" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Now look at the oxy Hb absorbance graph again, but this time paying attention to the wavelengths of light used in pulse oximeters. You will see that oxy Hb absorbs more infrared light than red light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_absorb.gif" alt="oxy_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Below is the graph that shows the absorbance of deoxy Hb. It is seen from the graph that deoxy Hb absorbs more Red light than Infrared light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_aborb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_aborb.gif" alt="deoxy_aborb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>To make the comparison of absorbance of oxy Hb and deoxy Hb easier, here is a composite graph showing the absorbance of both. You will see that :</p>
<p>Oxy Hb absorbs more infrared light than red light</p>
<p>Deoxy Hb absorbs more red light than infrared light</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_absorb.gif" alt="combined_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>You might find the memory aide below useful to remember the wavelengths absorbed by oxy Hb and deoxy Hb.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/absorb_memory.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/absorb_memory.gif" alt="absorb_memory" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter works out the oxygen saturation by comparing how much red light and infra red light is absorbed by the blood. Depending on the amounts of oxy Hb and deoxy Hb present, the ratio of the amount of red light absorbed compared to the amount of infrared light absorbed changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_ratio.gif" alt="oxy_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Using this ratio, the pulse oximeter can then work out the oxygen saturation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ratio_computer.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ratio_computer.gif" alt="ratio_computer" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>For an example, at 100 % saturation, the absorbance ratio ( i.e. comparing how much red light and infrared light is absorbed) will be same as that seen with the oxy Hb absorbance curve that we saw earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_ratio.gif" alt="hundred_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>At 0 % saturation, there is only deoxy Hb. The absorbance ratio ( i.e. comparing how much red light and infrared light is absorbed) will therefore be same as that seen with the de oxy Hb absorbance curve that we saw earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_ratio.gif" alt="zero_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Now look at when the patient has an oxygen saturation of 75 %. The blood has both , oxy Hb and deoxy Hb. The absorbance pattern is now somewhere in between the oxy Hb curve and deoxy Hb …</p></div></div></section></div></main></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Recently at work I managed to hit the Orphan Rules implementing some things for an internal crate. Orphan Rules you say? These are ancient rules passed down from the <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/01/14/little-orphan-impls">before times (pre 1.0)</a> that have to do with trait coherence. Mainly, if you and I both implement a trait from another crate on the same type in another crate and we compile the code, which implementation do we use? Coherence is about knowing exactly which implementation of the code we use. Unfortunately this can be a bit strict at times and was the issue I ran into that I want to talk about how it was solved.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgattozzi.dev/content/images/2020/07/EQnJasjUUAAblGi.jpg.jpg" alt="Oliver Twist holding up a bowl asking for more"><figcaption>Please sir can I have a foreign impl on a foreign type?</figcaption></figure><p>I'm going to be intentionally vague here, but bear with me as the thing I want to talk about is the actual solution that you might need dear reader. My work code base is a chonky one, around 330,000 lines of actual code (which is all pre-macro) according to tokei. We absolutely have to break this up into multiple crates. There's just no other way to cache this effectively (fun times for CI) and separate logical concerns. This means we use types in the main application that come from these more foundational crates.</p><p>In this specific instance we have a crate that acts like a store of different types. It's a <code>HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, HashMap&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn Any + Send + Sync&gt;&gt;</code> wrapped in a type that has methods to access it. A more redacted slimmed down version is this:</p><pre><code>pub struct Store {
  // The first key is the "Type" of the object, while the second key is
  // it's "Name". We can have multiple of the same "Type"
  inner: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, HashMap&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn Any + Send + Sync&gt;&gt;
}

impl Store {
  pub fn get&lt;T&gt;(name: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;
    where T: Storeable
  {
    //.....
  }
  
  // Some other similar methods for retrieval
}</code></pre><p>The key here is this <code>Storeable</code> trait that is pretty important it looks like:</p><pre><code>pub trait Storeable {
  const TYPE: &amp;'static str;
  fn cast(val: Value) -&gt; Result&lt;Box&lt;(dyn Any + Send + Sync)&gt;, Error&gt; {
    let val = Self::try_from(val)?;
    Ok(Box::new(val))
  }
}</code></pre><p>We essentially take some unformed blob of data and cast it and put it in the store when we create it. How the <code>try_from</code> is implemented is not important, just the fact that we cast the value to some Rust type. This is part of a whole crate to just take things in and turn them into this <code>Store</code> that we can pull different Rust types out of. As such we needed a way to pass data from the main application across crate boundaries so we could know what data needed to be casted from and to what types. This leads us to the <code>Registry</code>:</p><pre><code>type RegMap =
  HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, Box&lt;dyn Fn(Value) -&gt; Result&lt;Box&lt;(dyn Any + Send + Sync)&gt;, Error&gt;&gt;&gt;;

pub struct Registry {
  reg: RegMap
}

impl Registry {
  pub fn new() -&gt; Self {
    Self {
      reg: HashMap::new(),
    }
  }

  pub fn register&lt;T&gt;(&amp;mut self)
  where
    T: Storeable,
    Error: std::convert::From&lt;&lt;U as TryFrom&lt;Value&gt;&gt;::Error&gt;,
  {
    self.reg.entry(U::TYPE).or_insert(
      Box::new(U::cast) as Box&lt;dyn Fn(Value) -&gt; Result&lt;Box&lt;(dyn Any + Send + Sync)&gt;, Error&gt;&gt;
    );
  }
  // The actual code that takes in values and runs it's casting functions on 
  // them that have been registered
}</code></pre><p>Every thing you want to be converted needs to be registered! Now we used to error if we had extra blobs of stuff and this signalled you needed to register things, which was fine when everything was in one repo, but we split it out. So you might run old code with brand new blobs causing it to fail since they weren't tied together. We had to relax this error, but this means if someone fails to register their type in the main application then we might not find out for a while since all they'll get is a <code>None</code> from the <code>Store</code>s <code>get</code> function. This meant we wanted to switch it to a compile time error instead! The solution? More trait bounds!</p><pre><code>// We created a trait in the crate
pub trait Registered {}

// We then created a little macro as the only way to register something
// hiding the documentation around the `register` function for the registry

macro_rules! register {
  ($reg:ident, $type:ty) =&gt; {
    impl cratename::Registered for $type {}
    $reg.register::&lt;$type&gt;();
  }
}</code></pre><p>Then in the main code we replaced all calls to register the function with the macro instead. Then we changed the function signature for the <code>get</code> method to <code>fn get&lt;T&gt;(name: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt; where T: Storeable + Registered</code>. This means that if you tried to pull out a type from the <code>Store</code> but forgot to register it the compiler would fail since you didn't implement the trait for it. Perfect right? Well all was right in the world until I hit <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html#E0210">E0210</a>. Remember how I said some of the types get defined in other subcrates. Well some of those types were registered prior to the change. Implementing the <code>Registered</code> trait in the type's crate also defeats the whole exercise here which is to enforce invocation of a function and make it a compile time error otherwise. We hit the Orphan Rules! Which inevitably led to this tweet in frustration trying to figure out ways to get around it.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">another day volunteering on the lang team. everyone keeps asking me if they can break the Orphan Rules. buddy, they wont even let me break em</p>— Michael "Free from the not free Army" Gattozzi (@mgattozzi) <a href="https://twitter.com/mgattozzi/status/1280887443370147846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>This is a reference to a famous dril tweet. Betsy Ross if you wanna look that up.</figcaption></figure><p>Now normally the advice is make a local New Type and impl the trait on that. For instance we could do:</p><pre><code>impl Registered for Foo {}
struct Foo(ForeignType);</code></pre><p>But that means we would have to create a New Type for every single foreign type and then our calls to <code>get</code> would be the wrapped type not the actual type which is confusing because you would ask for type <code>Foo</code> in the function and get a <code>Bar</code> instead which is just bad API design in this case. Well then we could do something like this then right?</p><pre><code>// In the crate change the impl to
pub trait Registered&lt;T&gt; {}

// In our main code
impl Registered&lt;LocalType&gt; for ForeignType {} 

// And changing our function defs to
pub fn register&lt;T, U&gt;() 
  where T: Storeable + Registered&lt;U&gt;
{
  //....
}

pub fn get&lt;T, U&gt;(name: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;
  where T: Storeable + Registered&lt;U&gt;
{
  //....
}</code></pre><p>This works actually! Which is fine for the call to register but this means for <em>every single call to <code>get</code> </em>your code looks like <code>store.get::&lt;ActualType, LocalType&gt;("some name")</code> which is hardly intuitive either. We want the API to remain the same because all the caller actually cares about is the type they want out of the <code>Store</code>. We can do this with some other shennanigans though by making the <code>U</code> apart of the types themselves. By changing the types to this:</p><pre><code>use std::marker::PhantomData;

pub struct Register&lt;U&gt; {
  reg: RegMap
  _phantom: PhantomData&lt;U&gt;
}

pub struct Store&lt;U&gt; {
  inner: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, HashMap&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn Any + Send + Sync&gt;&gt;
  _phantom: PhantomData&lt;U&gt;
}</code></pre><p>We have constrained the local type so to speak. First we would change our macro to look like this:</p><pre><code>macro_rules! register {
  ($reg:ident, $local:ty , $type:ty) =&gt; {
    impl cratename::Registered&lt;$ty&gt; for $type {}
    $reg.register::&lt;$type&gt;();
  }
}</code></pre><p>We then would change our functions to look like:</p><pre><code>pub fn register&lt;T&gt;() 
  where T: Storeable + Registered&lt;U&gt;
{
  //....
}

pub fn get&lt;T&gt;(name: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;
  where T: Storeable + Registered&lt;U&gt;
{
  //....
}</code></pre><p>And in our impl that <code>U</code> comes from the type itself e.g. <code>impl&lt;U&gt; Store&lt;U&gt;</code>. Now the only places that need the local type to be typed out at all are function calls the <code>Store</code> gets passed to which isn't the most ideal thing, but it declutters the function calls which are arguably more important to understand.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>If you hit these rules yourself with similar constraints as ours, then I hope this bit of knowledge will help you overcome that hump. More often than not the New Type way should suffice, but in this case we needed something different. I'd really like if the rules could be relaxed if the crates are all in the same workspace and internal like they are at work, but I'm sure there are difficulties on figuring out if crates in a workspace are up on crates.io let alone another registry etc. etc. Nothing about designing a language is easy and there are a lot of reasons these rules do exist and are really constrained. Just like how NLL helped relax what the borrow checker would accept in terms of valid programs, I'm hoping future versions of the compiler might ease up a bit more on the rules. Either way there was at least a solution, even if it wasn't my most favorite one, but I got to learn a lot in the process and hopefully you did too!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since the revelations of Edward Snowden and learning about the fact that the United States Government implements and utilizes commercial-grade equipment to spy on society, there's been an ongoing battle for personal privacy. Most don't do this because they have things to hide, but because they have important things to protect, like their banking information or previous addresses. With the rise of major technology companies and governments at the helm of new technical innovations and controlling most people's everyday lives, it becomes people's responsibility to carefully handle their personal information- both online and offline. For those unfamiliar, this blog post seeks to provide a “quick start guide” on how one can protect their info from malicious actors, governments, and so forth.</p>

<h2 id="data-aggregation">Data Aggregation</h2>

<p>How do big tech companies make money? Let's use Amazon as an example- since they are forced <em>by law</em> to disclose their earnings on all the companies they own, we can easily tell that Amazon actually LOSES MONEY on their main retail site that a user buys products on. Huh? How does this work? As it turns out, advertising companies pay vast sums of money for <em>actionable leads</em>, or information that can lead to a <em>conversion</em>, or a customer visiting their page or store and making a purchase. Naturally for a company such as Amazon to draw a profit from this, they need to collect and resell user data.</p>

<h3 id="who-on-earth-buys-this-information">Who On Earth Buys This Information?</h3>

<p>If you have visited sites similar to <a href="https://whitepages.com/" rel="nofollow">Whitepages.com</a>, odds are that you may be familiar with what this sort of data is used for. It's collected on a <em>MASSIVE</em> scale and used for marketing, Open-Source Intelligence (how hackers, the CIA and NSA all get your personal info), COVID-19 contact tracing, and more. Some of the major sites are <a href="https://intelius.com/" rel="nofollow">Intelius.com</a>, <a href="https://whitepages.com/" rel="nofollow">Whitepages.com</a>, and [Pipl.com][<a href="https://pipl.com/" rel="nofollow">https://pipl.com</a>]. Other marketing agencies may also collect your valuable private information.</p>

<h3 id="okay-how-do-i-stop-this">Okay, How Do I Stop This?</h3>

<p>If you opted to create social media accounts, there are a few ways to remove information from the internet:
– Google search yourself, deleting old accounts and opting out of sites like Whitepages.
– Pay a privacy management service online. There are several of these.
– Hire a Private Investigator to remove your information for you (this is the most expensive option).</p>

<p>Fortunately, most data aggregators have a <em>tiiiiny</em> little “DO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION” button at the bottoms of their pages, which you can utilize to remove the offending information.</p>

<h2 id="insecure-software">Insecure Software</h2>

<p>It has been proven numerous times that taking a proactive approach towards digital security is the ONLY way to mitigate security issues as they arise. Many well-known programs and systems have an extremely poor reputation for being horribly insecure, and it is recommended to avoid them at all costs. For the sake of brevity, we won't cover this in depth, but will instead provide recommended software:</p>

<p>RECOMMENDATIONS:
Operating System: Qubes OS, OpenBSD, Whonix
Password manager: Keepass X/variants
Web Browser: ungoogled-chromium, iceweasel, Tor Browser
Email service: lavabit, protonmail
Filehosting: rent a VPS in switzerland and selfhost NextCloud
Voice/Video Conferencing: Jitsi meet
Phone Calls/SMS: Signal App</p>

<h2 id="physical-security">Physical Security</h2>

<p>An important thing many people claim to have “on point” is their physical security. This may involve the installing of locks for the doors to your home, ensuring a laptop isn't left unlocked in public, etc. However, many leave gaps in what measures can be made.</p>

<h3 id="the-mail">The Mail</h3>

<p>Did you know it's possible to read other people's mail by simply holding the closed envelope to light or spraying freon gas (sold in magic shops) against the envelope, which will temporarily make the envelope transparent? As it turns out, the simplest way to prevent this from happening is to wrap your mail in foil before putting it in an envelope. This makes it resistant to light and resistant to gases like freon.</p>

<h3 id="locks-and-doors">Locks and Doors</h3>

<p>Lockpicking is a growing sport, and as a result the bypassing of doors is becoming easier and easier to perform. To ensure nobody enters rooms or buildings they aren't supposed to be in, it's <em>crucial</em> that the doors be properly fitted to their frames and have higher end locks and latches installed to deter wannabe thieves.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-hackers-do">What Do “Hackers” Do?</h2>

<p>Hackers are seen as the proverbial bad guy who attacks computers and IT infrastructure, but an etymology of the word implies that people who are hackers love to innovate and creatively solve new and interesting problems. The common worry is the “cracker”, or a person who breaks (cracks) other's security measures set in place for fun or for profit.</p>

<p>These attacks may or may not be performed with any malicious intent- just for the sake of exploration. However, this does mean that there is something to be learned. If an attacker compromises your security in any way, shape or form it is <em>critical</em> to institute a means of mitigating the way they gained access.</p>

<p>On top of this, it's not uncommon for crackers and hackers alike to be hired and found working in professions such as a Security Analyst role, due to their intense eye for detail and passion for how things work.</p>

<h2 id="without-further-ado">Without Further Ado...</h2>

<p>This is <em>by no means</em> a comprehensive guide on personal privacy, but rather a means to get started. On top of this, it's important to remember that nothing will EVER be fully secure. So, if anyone wishes to obtain that elusive private life, they will have to keep up with the times and actively work to ensure privacy is their #1 concern.</p>

<p>I will continue to post more on privacy-related content as time goes on, but since this is such a vast field it is critical that anyone concerned perform their research and due diligence.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
<p>Over the past two months I’ve built <a href="https://friendlycaptcha.com/">FriendlyCaptcha</a>, a privacy friendly alternative to Google reCAPTCHA. Normally if I were to start a new web application, I would write the server code in Golang, spin up a Postgres instance, and host a dockerized version of it on Google Cloud Run to get many of the serverless benefits.</p>
<p>For a CAPTCHA product the requirements were a bit different: it is crtical that its API is fast, always available, has predictable costs, and can scale up and down instantly. A CAPTCHA service being down is a big issue for users, they can’t verify the challenges submitted by their website visitors and face a dilemma: to allow requests without a valid challenge or to reject all requests (I propose they do the first!).</p>
<p>Serverless can be a good choice for minimizing the risk of downtime for your APIs, especially if you only have a small team. There are less moving parts, a datacenter outage doesn’t mean your service is down, and also the individual workers are more isolated and short-lived reducing the chance of an error putting your server into an unrecoverable bad state.</p>
<h2 id="cloudflare-workers">Cloudflare Workers<a href="#cloudflare-workers">#</a></h2>
<p>A couple years ago Cloudflare launched <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Workers</a>, a serverless platform that runs your code on <em>the edge</em>. That means your code runs in their datacenters all over the world, so any callee should have good latency from just about everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Your code in a Cloudflare Worker runs in a V8 isolate which means that the overhead of cold starts is extremely small (less than 5ms), and response times in general are ridiculously fast because of this. This makes it great for server side rendering and APIs.</p>
<p>There is a catch, you have to make sure your server logic ‘fits’ within these limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less than 50ms of computation time for given request. Time that your script is waiting for a request does not count and not doing any computation.</li>
<li>Your code needs to either be written in Javascript or be a WebAssembly binary. Your total code bundle can only be 1MB in total size.</li>
<li>You can not use more than 128MB of memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can make it work you get a whole lot in return.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-state">Keeping state<a href="#keeping-state">#</a></h2>
<p>Most applications or APIs have some state, even if it’s only secrets used for authentication. You could of course talk to your relational database of choice, but that removes any latency advantages of running code on the edge and re-introduces a single point of failure(unless you have your own globally replicated relational database, which is possible, but as we’re starting a new product here we don’t have that just yet).</p>
<p>Instead we can keep state in a few different ways:</p>
<h3 id="cache">Cache<a href="#cache">#</a></h3>
<p>Cloudflare Workers offers a cache that is at the level of a datacenter. This is useful for caching objects for minutes up to hours.</p>
<p>In FriendlyCaptcha this is how we can cache valid API keys without talking to the database every time.</p>
<h3 id="workers-kv">Workers KV<a href="#workers-kv">#</a></h3>
<p>Workers KV is a key value store that is globally distributed and eventually consistent, built into Cloudflare Workers. It is designed for infrequent writing (up to once per second), but frequent reading. This is great if you want to cache data that your worker simply forwards (e.g. a file on S3). If you frequently read from a key its value will get cached in the local edge datacenter.</p>
<p>In FriendlyCaptcha this is used to store user sessions when you log into the website.</p>
<h3 id="serverless-friendly-databases">Serverless-friendly databases<a href="#serverless-friendly-databases">#</a></h3>
<p>Workers KV is not a great place to store data such as your user’s data due to its eventual consistency and lack of powerful query support. Databases such as <a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore">Firestore</a> are a good fit for the serverless model, it’s a fully managed service and you pay for usage and data storage instead of nodes and uptime.</p>
<p>In FriendlyCaptcha it is important that the solution of a solved CAPTCHA can not be re-used, by storing all completed puzzles in FaunaDB as well as in the Cloudflare Cache we can make sure that never happens.</p>
<h2 id="website-on-the-edge">Website on the edge<a href="#website-on-the-edge">#</a></h2>
<p>By rendering the website on the edge you can achieve very quick response times and small bundle sizes, while still allowing you to use a templating engine and adapt the page to the user (e.g. for thei dashboard).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://friendlycaptcha.com/">FriendlyCaptcha website</a> is pure HTML and CSS that all gets rendered on the edge, there is no client-size Javascript. While I love frameworks like React, for a website (and many websites really) it’s overkill. By rendering the website on the edge you get something that’s in between a fully static website and a dynamic website.</p>
<p>For templating I use <a href="https://github.com/popeindustries/lit-html-server">lit-html-server</a>, and I’m happy with that choice. It’s just Javascript and template literals that you can compose in a way that makes sense for you, there was no new framework to learn.</p>
<p>For a bigger real world example of a serverside rendering approach using CloudFlare workers is the <a href="https://discord.gg/">Discord website</a>, it is so fast.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-cloudflare-workers">What are the advantages of Cloudflare Workers?<a href="#what-are-the-advantages-of-cloudflare-workers">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your code runs close to the client in multiple datacenters, you don’t have to manage any of that, and you can sleep at night knowing that a sudden hug of death probably won’t take down your service.</li>
<li>Predictable pricing, which at small to medium scale is often much lower than the classic load balancer + application servers setup.</li>
<li>Less moving parts: a single script containing all API and website logic makes life easier. Having a development, staging and production environment is easy this way.</li>
<li>If you are replacing a (SPA) you can start moving logic to the server, decreasing bundle size and the amount of endpoints you have to expose.</li>
<li>The tooling is fairly good, there’s a way to have environment variables and manage secrets, and you can preview your site/API locally.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-some-disadvantages">What are some disadvantages?<a href="#what-are-some-disadvantages">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In most serverless Javascript environments your code does not run in Node. Many libraries and client SDKs will only work in a Node environment.. I couldn’t use the SDK for BigQuery, Sentry, Mailgun or Stripe, and instead had to use their REST APIs.</li>
<li>There are limitations: only few languages are supported, 1MB max script size, 50ms runtime, 128MB of memory.</li>
<li>There is some degree of lock-in. CloudFlare workers follow the Webworker spec, so it should be fairly easy to move to another provider, but if you use any goodies such as their KV distributed datastore changing that code to use something like Redis instead will require some effort.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-i-go-fully-serverless">Should I go (fully) serverless?<a href="#should-i-go-fully-serverless">#</a></h2>
<p>Probably not, think about the application that you are building and whether any of these advantages matter. You can probably start off by writing the backend logic in your preferred language and running that on a machine on your favorite cloud provider. When that single machine no longer cuts it, you can introduce more machines.</p>
<p>Remember that if you are trying to build a product, whether something costs $5 or $10 per month probably won’t make the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p>If your load is unpredictable, you require low latency, and you need reliability, then perhaps it may be the right choice. If you are building a tiny service, such as a Slack bot or a log-in wall in front of a static website, serverless is probably a great choice.</p>
<p>Finally, another good reason to use it is for fun or just to get acquainted with serverless. Limitations and constraints usually foster creative problem solving, which is perfect for hobby projects.</p>

July 16, 2020 | https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>To tell people that you had a close working relationship with the North Korean military for a 6 month period would in itself raise more than a few eyebrows. Working for 3 years in North Korea was on the one hand a time of frustration and on the other a time of discovery in this fascinating&nbsp;yet enigmatic country. Butting heads on a daily basis with the stifling North Korean bureaucracy was always a battle, but occasionally there was a glimmer of achievement and sometimes from the most unlikeliest of sources.</p>
<p>In early 2004, I was contacted at the embassy in Pyongyang by the brother of an RAF pilot who had been shot down in 1952 over North Korea during the Korean war. He said he had full details of the shoot down supplied by eyewitness United States Air Force (USAF) pilots and map coordinates of the site of the crash (which he sent to me) and wished to visit the area to discover the fate of his brother.</p>
<p>The background was that the pilot, Flt Lt Desmond Hinton, who received the Distinguished Flying Cross in World War II for shooting down two Japanese fighters had bailed out of his burning F84e Thunderjet whilst carrying out a strafing mission north east of Pyongyang on 2 January 1952. At the time, Flt Lt Hinton was one of a number of RAF pilots who were attached to and flying with the USAF. Despite enquiries after the war and with no further information as to his fate forthcoming, Flt Lt Hinton was subsequently officially listed as missing in action.</p>
<p>This seemed a daunting request, but nevertheless I submitted it to the North Koreans and having gone through the usual long and tortuous channels I was surprised to receive an invitation to a meeting with senior North Korean military officers to discuss the request. Soon after therefore, it was with some degree of trepidation that I and my interpreter set off to meet these senior officers at a large military base on the outskirts of Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Driving into the base, we stopped at the entrance guard house and I was told to leave my diplomatic vehicle parked there. Then my interpreter and I climbed into a small military vehicle with an officer who my interpreter told me would be our liaison officer for the visit.</p>
<p>The base was huge. We drove past ranks of tanks, armoured vehicles and lorries which appeared to be in pristine (and highly polished) condition. I did learn later that this base was one of several in the Pyongyang garrison that supplied vehicles for the massed televised parades.</p>
<p>A short while later we pulled up outside a large office building. Our liaison officer led us in and up the stairs to a large conference room where sat several high ranking officers. There were also some junior officers milling around as well as a couple of shady looking civilians who never took their eyes off me for the whole meeting. Very disconcerting.</p>
<p>Some commands were rapped out in Korean and everyone sat down. I then outlined my request to them and also provided them with all the relevant information that had been sent to me from the UK. They listened politely. They were very courteous and the atmosphere was more relaxed than I had anticipated. When I had finished my spiel and before they responded to my request, tea was brought in and they all lit up cigarettes. As I drank my tea, they all began a long conversation amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, they said they would investigate this case and get back in touch. So thinking that this was an end to the proceedings, I stood up preparing to leave, but surprisingly no, it was not quite the end. They invited me to have lunch with them, which took me completely off guard.</p>
<p>Before I could respond, another command was rapped out and a series of orderlies wheeled in trollies containing a cold buffet and drink. The buffet was well prepared but the only downside was at the end of the meeting there were several toasts which meant imbibing several shots of the lethal North Korean Soju the after effects of which I did in due course suffer!</p>
<p>So the meeting finally came to an end. I thought that after this first meeting, that would be the end of it. I would get the usual reply back saying this request was not possible to facilitate. The Korean War was something that the North Koreans revered. Museums full of captured allied equipment, films, memorials, statues and posters depicting their glorious victory abounded everywhere. So requesting assistance in finding a hated enemy, albeit a fallen one, was perhaps a request too far.</p>
<p>But surprisingly, no.</p>
<p>Against all expectations, they did get back to me shortly afterwards with some quite startling news. Based on the information I had given them, they had identified the crash site which was close to a village called Kuso-ri/Gueso-ri situated near to what is currently the main airport for Pyongyang.</p>
<p>They had spoken with villagers including two elders who had witnessed the shoot down. Flt Lt Hinton had indeed ejected but his parachute failed and he was killed on impact. The villagers had then interred him in an unmarked grave in a field adjacent to the village. This spot had been identified and human bones and fragments of uniform and aircraft were also uncovered. This scenario is somewhat similar to my previous post <a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/tragic-raf-pilots-secret-grave-discovered-in-albania/">Tragic RAF Pilot’s Secret Grave Discovered In Albania</a></p>
<p>This news then led over the next six months to a long series of meetings, usually weekly either at Army HQ in Pyongyang, the crash site or at a military base on the outskirts of the city chaired on the military side by Senior Colonel Kwak Chol-hui who was to be my main point of contact for this project. I am glad to report that the two shady civilians from our first meeting never did make a reappearance.</p>
<p>The Colonel who would later go on to be promoted to Major General was responsible throughout the negotiations for arranging visits to the site, meetings with the two surviving eyewitnesses and agreeing that Flt Lt Hinton’s brother would be fast tracked for a visa and allowed to visit the DPRK site to pay his final respects to his brother.</p>
<p>True to their word, Flt Lt Hinton’s brother was granted his visa and permitted to visit the village. At a meeting we had with the military, he was offered the choice of having his brother’s remains repatriated to the south via Panmunjon or re-buried on the outskirts of the village. He chose the latter. Therefore, the military re-buried his remains in a properly marked grave and on the final day of his visit, he was part of a small, brief ceremony attended by members of the British Embassy, North Korean military and villagers.</p>
<p>Despite my requests, the North Koreans had refused to allow me to obtain a properly inscribed headstone from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, so a simple marker was used instead. Overall, it was a small victory but did give some form of closure to the family of Flt Lt Hinton.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, I met Colonel Kwak Chol-hui (pictured above with me at a Queens Birthday Party celebration in Pyongyang) and his team on many occasions over that 6 month period. As well as working on the Hinton project, he also eased the process of enabling me to take the very rare numbers of visitors we got down to the DMZ at Panmunjon as part of their “North Korean experience”. The other was the USS Pueblo where the military arranged private tours for me (Pueblo post to follow).</p>
<p>At Panmunjon, when I took visitors down to view the DMZ, we were always hosted by the military who would lay on briefings and guides for our visitors as well as a lunch afterwards. I could always see the look of bewilderment on the faces of the South Korean border guards and US military standing a few feet away on the southern side of the demarcation line wondering who these foreigners were on the other side looking a tad too cosy with North Korean officers!</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: In 2011, the remains of Flt Lt Hinton were finally repatriated and in a ceremony at Panmunjon, the remains were passed over to military authorities in the south.</strong></em></p>

<p>In 2013, an NSA contractor leaked an internal review of project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_Wind">Stellar Wind</a>, also known as the Presidentâ€™s Surveillance Program (PSP). This project, and its successors, have been the focus of at least two public hearings from the Senate Intelligence Committee - in <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-fisa-legislation">2013</a> and <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-fisa-legislation-0">2017</a>. Write-ups of these leaks, and the Senate hearings covering them, have given us a rare inside look into how the government conducts warrantless domestic surveillance. There are many articles covering general privacy and security. This article is focused on protecting you from what we know of warrantless domestic surveillance. <!--more--> If you want some background information on how we believe the governmentâ€™s mass surveillance program works, and why we recommend what we recommend, read on. Otherwise <a href="#summary">click here</a> to jump straight to our recommendations.</p>

<p>Distinguishing between a government official without a warrant and one with a warrant is important, as we believe the two have different levels of access to your personal data. When documents for the PSP were thrust into the light of day in 2013, we learned something valuable as citizens: our government was <em>trying</em> to follow the law. Granted <a href="https://www.aaup.org/brief/aclu-v-nsa-493-f3d-644-6th-cir-2007">courts have ruled</a> the program was illegal, the vice presidentâ€™s lawyer drafted an interpretation of the law arguing the program was legal. It appears the NSA invested great effort in trying to stay within that interpretation of the law. In other words, the government might <em>really</em> stretch the law when it comes to surveillance but they still try to follow it.</p>



<p>So they are watching us without a warrant. How is that legal?</p>

<p>The first Senate Intelligence Committee hearing showed us part of the legal theory they were using to justify the program: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland">Smith vs. Maryland 442 U.S. 735 (1979)</a>. Michael Lee Smith had robbed someone and was repeatedly threatening them over the phone. The police, having identified Smith as a suspect, installed a â€œbugâ€� at the phone company which would record the phone numbers Smith dialed catching him making the threatening call. They did not get a warrant to do this.</p>

<p>Smithâ€™s lawyers argued this constituted a warrantless search. They took it all the way to the Supreme Court. The verdict? Smith didnâ€™t have a reasonable expectation of privacy when he dialed the phone number. The phone number was being shared with the phone company who is known to record the numbers customers dial for billing purposes.</p>

<p>To justify mass surveillance, the government argued that â€œmetadataâ€� (more on this term later) has no reasonable expectation of privacy. If Smith vs. Maryland applies to any one person then it applies to everyone all at once. If you can record the phone number a single person dials then you can also record all of the phone numbers all of your citizens dial.</p>



<p>A central point in the governmentâ€™s mass surveillance program is distinguishing between â€œcontentâ€� and â€œmetadataâ€�. Content is the <em>actual</em> communication, like Smithâ€™s voice in a phone call. Metadata is information <em>about</em> a communication; the phone number Smith dialed. For example, when we send a letter in the mail, we could call everything inside the envelope â€œcontentâ€�; the mailing address, return address, weight, date sent, date received, postage paid, who paid the postage, etc. could be called â€œmetadataâ€�.</p>

<p>When you make a phone call, view a website, or send an email, you leave a trail of metadata about that communication. Your electronic devices frequently communicate on your behalf, without any interaction from you, leaving a trail of metadata. The government believes they have a right to record and search that metadata without needing a warrant.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/why-metadata-matters">EFF</a> is on point when describing the problem of not applying the 4th amendment to communication metadata:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They know you called the suicide prevention hotline from the Golden Gate Bridge. But the topic of the call remains a secret.</p>

  <p>They know you got an email from an HIV testing service, then called your doctor, then visited an HIV support group website in the same hour. But they donâ€™t know what was in the email or what you talked about on the phone.</p>

  <p>They know you received an email from a digital rights activist group with the subject line â€œLetâ€™s Tell Congress: Stop SESTA/FOSTAâ€� and then called your elected representative immediately after. But the content of those communications remains safe from government intrusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where it is critical to differentiate between warrantless surveillance and targeted surveillance with a warrant. If you believe the government has a warrant to search the content of your communication, then this blog post isnâ€™t going to help you. If your goal is to avoid passive warrantless searches, to keep your communication metadata from being stored in a government database, this blog post is going to walk you through the tools you can use and why we believe they work.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s take a look at some common stuff people do with tech, and the small changes you can make to prevent your data from ending up in the governmentâ€™s mass surveillance databases.</p>



<p>Most of our communication today happens over the public internet. Instead of phone calls and text messages, we use video chat and messenger apps. In addition to the metadata generated by the messages we send, the Internetâ€™s protocol generates a bunch of metadata as well: what servers your devices connect to, how much data you exchange, how frequently you visit, etc.</p>

<p>Much of this metadata centers around connecting to computers and involves something you may have heard of before: an IP address (short for internet-protocol). When you buy internet from your cable provider or cell phone carrier, they assign you an ip address for connecting to the internet - a random looking collection of numbers and dots that looks something like: 24.56.20.230. This IP address is like a mailing address. The government records this metadata in a database, keeping track of what IP address talked to what IP address, in the same way they may keep track of the sender/recipient of a letter sent via the mail.</p>

<p>This means that, from the moment we connect to the internet, the government can keep a record of everything we do. To avoid warrantless tracking, we recommend using a VPN. A VPN can obscure your IP Address by allowing your device to connect to the internet through their servers. This means the government will only be able to see that you connected to the VPN but wonâ€™t be able to see what you did through that connection without advanced traffic analysis. While a VPN can protect you from surveillance, itâ€™s important to choose your VPN provider carefully since youâ€™ll be sharing all of your internet activity with them. We trust <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad</a> for this. Mullvad is the company providing the servers for <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">Mozillaâ€™s VPN</a> and has a <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/help/no-logging-data-policy/">no-nonsense privacy policy</a>.</p>

<p>Mullvad does some important things that make it the front-running pick for a VPN provider. First, they donâ€™t use user accounts. They generate a random account number for you. There is no way for Mullvad to tell who owns what account. You can put money and your account number in an envelope without a return address and send it to them. Of course, you can also pay with a credit card which will associate you with the account. Next, they keep no logs of connections and they only use the bare minimum amount of metadata necessary to route and authenticate requests. Finally, for advanced users, Mullvad supports â€œmulti-hopâ€� connections, meaning your communication is routed through multiple servers before reaching the internet.</p>

<p>We believe using a VPN provider like Mullvad will help keep your personal internet metadata out of government databases.</p>



<p>If you are wanting to communicate with one or more people, many people reach for text messaging, social media messengers, or email. Instead, we recommend <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>.</p>

<p>Your email can be read by anyone with access to the network between you and the recipient, including all metadata about the communication. Text messages share all routing information (like phone numbers associated with a text) with the telecom provider. From what we know of government mass surveillance, the government is storing this metadata (email recipient, sender, timestamp, subject line, etc.) in a database. Similarly, they are storing text message metadata as well.</p>

<p>Signal, in contrast, takes great care to limit what data you share publicly when messaging folks. Theyâ€™ve developed some state-of-the-art tech that allows for messages to be sent with very little metadata being generated. In fact, Signal uses a technique known as â€œsealed senderâ€�, meaning itâ€™s not possible to tell who is communicating with who on the Signal network. From what we know of government bulk metadata collection, your messages sent on the Signal network will be safe from the program.</p>



<p>When browsing the web, and interacting with this technology, you generate a <em>massive</em> amount of metadata that the government can scoop up into a database.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend using <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> which is run by a security focused non-profit. By default, Firefox ships with a feature called DNS over HTTPS. DNS, or domain name service, is what takes a web address like â€œevertwoyears.orgâ€� and translates it into one of those IP addresses we talked about before. When you type a web address into a browser, your computer generates a DNS request that the government can store. Firefox encrypts this traffic, and resolves it using <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">CloudFlare</a>, which we believe keeps it out of government databases.</p>

<p>Once you have Firefox Installed, we recommend installing <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/">HTTPS Everywhere</a>, a plugin that forces websites to encrypt all traffic you send. HTTP is the language web browsers speak when they download websites. HTTP doesnâ€™t have any protections, so just like email, anybody who has access to the network between you and the website you are viewing can see everything you do. HTTPS on the other hand encrypts almost everything. …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Don’t get me wrong: I have nothing against <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew<sup><i></i></sup></a>, the macOS package manager that most devs who run Apple laptops use on a near-daily basis. It’s served me admirably all these years and I’ve even written some Homebrew recipes.</p><p>But I’ve become convinced that there’s a better way—or at least a way that suits my needs better. I recently switched from Homebrew to <a href="https://github.com/rycee/home-manager" target="_blank">Home Manager<sup><i></i></sup></a>, the <a href="https://nixos.org/nix" target="_blank">Nix<sup><i></i></sup></a>-based user environment manager created by <a href="https://github.com/rycee" target="_blank">Robert Helgesson<sup><i></i></sup></a>, and I’ve been extremely pleased with the results so far. Home Manager has enabled me to establish a fully <strong>declarative approach</strong> to managing my laptop environment, including my dotfiles.</p><blockquote><p>You can see my current Home Manager configuration in the <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config" target="_blank">lucperkins/nix-home-config<sup><i></i></sup></a> repo, which includes</p></blockquote><h2 id="homebrew-pros">What I do like about Homebrew</h2><p>The two things I like most about Homebrew are its comprehensiveness and its ease of use. There are tons of packages, many of which have multiple versions; it’s rare that you can’t find what you need. And when you install Homebrew using the simple <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">script<sup><i></i></sup></a> on the site it pretty much Just Works out of the gate. Virtually all of the “issues” I’ve had with Homebrew have been rooted in user error or missing versions of packages. For me it’s been an indispensable tool for years and years. Kudos to the creators and maintainers!</p><h2 id="homebrew-cons">What Homebrew doesn’t get you</h2><p>The only real “problems” with Homebrew are that (a) you have to manually manage your packages via <code>brew install</code>, <code>brew rm</code>, and other <code>brew</code> commands and (b) it doesn’t enable you to manage other assets, like dotfiles (for tools like <a href="https://vim.org/" target="_blank">vim<sup><i></i></sup></a> and <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux" target="_blank">tmux<sup><i></i></sup></a>). Item (b) is no surprise, of course, because Homebrew doesn’t even purport to offer that. But I have always yearned for something that can do both in one go.</p><h2 id="intro">Enter Home Manager</h2><p>I’ve been a big fan of <a href="https://nixos.org/nix" target="_blank">Nix<sup><i></i></sup></a> for years. Admittedly, I tend to be a bigger fan of the philosophy behind it—a totally declarative approach to dependency management rooted in functional programming—than of the ecosystem’s tools. I find Nix the language to be unnecessarily opaque (though it’s grown on me) and setup can be daunting. I even once intended to write a book on Nix but found it a bit too daunting.</p><p>Anyway, I came across <a href="https://github.com/rycee/home-manager" target="_blank">Home Manager<sup><i></i></sup></a> for Nix a while back and filed it away in my memory until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSW5DqTyfOI9sUvnFoCjBlQ" target="_blank">Burke Libbey<sup><i></i></sup></a>‘s excellent YouTube series reawakened my interest. So I gave it a try, started hacking on a <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config" target="_blank">config<sup><i></i></sup></a>, and soon I had a light bulb moment.</p><blockquote><p>You can see my current Home Manager config in my <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config" target="_blank">lucperkins/nix-home-config<sup><i></i></sup></a> repo on GitHub, which includes usage instructions in case you want to give my config a spin and make your own modifications. Clone and fork away!</p></blockquote><p>The end result:</p><ul><li>I have a <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config/blob/master/home.nix#L32-L91" target="_blank">long list<sup><i></i></sup></a> of packages that Home Manager installs for me. All I have to do is run <code>home-manager switch</code> and installation just works.</li><li>The Git configuration that I used to manually manage in <code>~/.gitconfig</code> and <code>~/.gitignore</code> is now encapsulated in one <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config/blob/master/git.nix" target="_blank">git.nix<sup><i></i></sup></a> file.</li><li>My <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config/blob/master/neovim.nix" target="_blank">Neovim<sup><i></i></sup></a> config is all in one file (no more <code>.vimrc</code>)</li><li>My <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux" target="_blank">tmux<sup><i></i></sup></a> config lives in <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config/blob/master/tmux.nix" target="_blank">tmux.nix<sup><i></i></sup></a></li><li>My shell config for both zsh and <a href="https://fishshell.com/" target="_blank">Fish<sup><i></i></sup></a> lives in <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config/blob/master/shell.nix" target="_blank">shell.nix<sup><i></i></sup></a>, including all my shell aliases and everything I’d ordinarily put in my <code>.zshrc</code> file.</li></ul><h3 id="snag">One little snag</h3><p>The one thing I had to come up with my own solution for is environment variables that I don’t want to commit to Git. I certainly don’t want to be sharing my <code>HEROKU_API_KEY</code> or <code>STRIPE_API_KEY</code> with the world. So I placed all my private env vars in a file at <code>~/.env</code> and added this in my <code>.zshrc</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>if</span> <span>[</span> -e ~/.env <span>]</span>; <span>then</span>

</code></pre></div><p>There may be a more elegant, Nix-y approach to that but this works fine.</p><h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3><p>Although I now use Home Manager as a full replacement for Homebrew, there are still some things that I manage manually:</p><ul><li>I install <a href="https://rustup.rs/" target="_blank">rustup<sup><i></i></sup></a> using Home Manager but manage Rust versions manually using that tool.</li><li>In principle you could use Home Manager to install and run <a href="https://docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker<sup><i></i></sup></a> and <a href="https://postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL<sup><i></i></sup></a>, but experimentation has shown that it’s much easier to just use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac" target="_blank">Docker for Mac<sup><i></i></sup></a> and <a href="https://postgresapp.com/" target="_blank">Postgres.app<sup><i></i></sup></a>, respectively.</li></ul><h2 id="how">How it works</h2><p>I won’t get too deep into the weeds of how <a href="https://nixos.org/nix" target="_blank">Nix<sup><i></i></sup></a> works in general, but I will say a bit about Home Manager. Basically Home Manager is a set of Nix functions that convert your supplied <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config" target="_blank">configuration<sup><i></i></sup></a> into a unitary, symlinked filesystem under <code>/nix/store</code>. Home Manager creates a “home” directory with a path like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">/nix/store/7zd60q7jzzg827z4ig7fyxsgh4yv5ym4-home-manager-path
</code></pre></div><p>All the packages specified in your configuration are placed under the <code>bin</code> directory there, each of which is symlinked to a specific package in your Nix store. Here’s what this looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">readlink <span>$(</span>which home-manager<span>)</span>
/nix/store/l0bd74aj0i25gmd72ayng63m0ma95qsg-home-manager-path/bin/home-manager

ls /nix/store/l0bd74aj0i25gmd72ayng63m0ma95qsg-home-manager-path/bin

/nix/store/l0bd74aj0i25gmd72ayng63m0ma95qsg-home-manager-path/bin/ruby
</code></pre></div><p>To update your environment, run <code>home-manager switch</code>. This builds a brand new Home Manager directory and generates new dotfiles for you and quite a lot else. I’d recommend running <code>tree</code> on that directory to see how it’s structured. If you poke around long enough you’ll find your generated config files, linked libraries, man pages, and more.</p><p>The beauty of Nix is that every time you update your configuration, even a little tiny bit, you get a brand new <code>/nix/store/***-home-manager-path</code> directory with a new hashed path. This ensures that nothing is ever linking to the wrong place and that you <em>never</em> get collisions. To garbage collect your old paths, just run <code>nix-collect-garbage</code>.</p><p>If you’re ever curious whether a package is available in the main <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs" target="_blank">nixpkgs<sup><i></i></sup></a> store, you can just run, for example, <code>nix search jq</code>. Thus far I’ve been able to get everything I need through nixpkgs, with the exception of a handful of things I’ve need to install using tools like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip" target="_blank">pip<sup><i></i></sup></a> and <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank">yarn<sup><i></i></sup></a>.</p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>If Homebrew works for you, great. Stick with it. It’s a really good tool. But if you’re feeling adventurous and want to try out a fully declarative approach to your macOS environment, Home Manager is a fantastic option.</p><p>I should also note that there’s no reason you can’t use both. In fact, I may end up needing to re-install Homebrew one of these days. But for now I’m humming along without it and having a lot of fun tweaking my settings, confident that Nix’s purity will forge a safe and worry-free path.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>



<ul><li>Understand the sections of a 32-bit and 64-bit IEEE-754 number.</li><li>Memorize the exponent <em>bias</em> for a 32-bit and 64-bit IEEE-754 exponent.</li></ul>



<h2>IEEE-754 Format</h2>



<p>IEEE-754 is just a fancy name for a standard that tells you (and the computer) how to arrange 32-bits or 64-bits. In this case, it's how you arrange these bits to allow for <em><strong>scientific notation</strong></em>, which is how we <em>float</em> the decimal. We can move the decimal place left by decreasing the exponent, or we can move the decimal place right by increasing the exponent. The following equations show how the exponent affects the decimal's location.</p>



<p>\(\)$$1.23\times~10^3=1230$$</p>



<p>$$1.23\times~10^{-3}=.00123$$</p>



<p>As you can see here, there are three (3) fields that IEEE-754 defines: (1) a sign (0 = positive, 1 = negative), (2) an exponent, and (3) a fraction. The sign is either a 0 or 1, and it DOES NOT follow two's complement. There is a -0 and a +0. The exponent is the exponent of base 2. The fraction is everything to the right of the decimal point. So, \(1.234\times~10^7\) would have a sign of 0 (positive), an exponent of 7 (not exactly, but stay with me so far), and a fraction of .234. This is all the information we need. Keep in mind that .234 is base 10. All IEEE-754 formats describe base 2. Just like x 10 to some power floats the decimal in base 10, if we multiply by 2 to some power, we can float the decimal in base 2. All IEEE-754 defines is scientific notation!</p>



<p>The exponent has a <strong><em>bias</em></strong>, which allows an unsigned number to have negative values. The exponent itself is an unsigned number. The 32-bit and 64-bit formats have different biases.</p>



<p>Take a number \(1.1101\times2^1\). Just like base 10, in base 2, when we multiply by 2, we move the decimal either right or left. So, the number becomes \(11.01_2=3.25_{10}\). In IEEE-754, the number must be 1.<em>something</em>. This is called <strong><em>normalized</em></strong>. So, we can't store 11.01 with an exponent of 0, we must store 1.101 with an exponent of 1. This is fairly easy to do by just adding or subtracting from the exponent until the decimal is directly after the 1. This gives us more bits to store in the fraction portion.</p>



<hr>



<h2>32-bit IEEE-754</h2>



<p>In C++, the 32-bit IEEE-754 number is used by the <strong><em>float</em></strong> data type in C++. In here, the 32-bits are arranged as follows.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://courses.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-32-bit.png" alt="" srcset="https://courses.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-32-bit.png 622w, https://courses.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-32-bit-300x61.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"><figcaption>IEEE-754, 32-bit format. 1-bit sign, 8-bit exponent, 23-bit fraction. Bias is 127.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>When we talk about a bias of 127, we mean that if we look at the 8-bit exponent in the 32-bit format, it's going to be 127 bigger than the actual exponent. So, if we want to figure out the actual exponent, we'd subtract 127. Say we had an exponent of \(1001\_1100_2=128+16+8+4=156_{10}\). So, we have a <em>biased</em> exponent of 156. We then subtract 127 from 156 to get the actual power of 2: \(156-127=29\). This means our number is \(1.\text{fraction}\times 2^{29}\).  The fraction is copied directly from the last 23 bits of the number. Recall that this is everything to the RIGHT of the decimal. The 1. portion is implied and is not explicitly in the 32-bits.</p>



<h3>32-bit Example</h3>



<p><em>Convert the following 32-bit number into decimal: 0x418e_0000.</em></p>



<p>First, we need to convert this into binary so we can parse out the 1-bit sign, 8-bit exponent, and 23-bit fraction:</p>



<p>$$418e\_0000_{16}=0100\_0001\_1000\_1110\_0000\_0000\_0000\_0000_2$$</p>



<p>The first bit is 0, which is a positive number. The next 8-bits are \(1000\_0011_2=128+2+1=131_{10}\), and the last 23-bits are \(.000111_2\). Since everything to the right of 0, we can ignore it. Just like 1.230 and 1.23 are identical, the same holds true for base 2.</p>



<p>Our exponent is 131, so we subtract the bias 127 to get an exponent of \(131-127=4\). The fractional portion was \(.000111\), and we have an implied 1., so we have \(1.000111\times 2^4\). Recall that a positive exponent moves the decimal right. In this case, it moves it to the right by four places. To remind yourself which way the decimal goes remember, bigger exponent means bigger number.</p>



<p>$$1.000111_2\times 2^4=10001.11_2$$</p>



<p>Now, we convert to base 10. Look to the left of the decimal first, \(10001_2=16+1=17_{10}\). Then, look to the right of the decimal: \(.11_2=0.5+0.25=0.75_{10}\). Putting the numbers together gives us \(17+0.75=17.75\).</p>



<p>So, 0x418e_0000 is the decimal value 17.75F.</p>



<h3>Another 32-bit Example</h3>



<p><em>Convert -81.0625 into 32-bit, IEEE-754 in hexadecimal.</em></p>



<p>Going the opposite direction still requires us to find three things: sign, exponent, and fraction. So, as always, first step: <em>convert to binary</em>.</p>



<p>\(-81.0625_{10}=-1010001.0001_2=1010001.001_2\times 2^0=-1.010001001_2\times 2^6\).</p>



<p>So, now we have it in binary and in <em>normalized</em> notation, that is 1.<em>something</em>. Now all we have to do is grab the sign, bias the exponent, and write down the fraction.</p>



<p>Sign = \(\text{negative}=1\)<br>Exponent = \(6+127=133_{10}=1000\_0101_2\)<br>Fraction = \(0100\_0100\_0100_2\)</p>



<p>So, the sign comes first, followed by the exponent, and finally the fraction--remember to keep adding zeroes until you get 23 total bits for the fraction.</p>



<pre>Sign   Exponent      Fraction
[1]    [1000 0101]   [0100 0100 0100 0000 0000 000]

1100 0010 1010 0010 0010 0000 0000 0000
C    2    A    2    2    0    0    0</pre>



<p>So, -81.0625 is 0xc2a2_2000 in 32-bit, IEEE-754 format.</p>



<hr>



<h2>64-bit IEEE-754 Format</h2>



<p>The 64-bit IEEE-754 format can be used in C++ by using the <strong><em>double</em></strong> data type. You will see that a double doesn't double every field, but instead gives you a somewhat bigger exponent, but a MUCH larger fraction space.</p>



<p>We still have three different fields: sign, exponent, and fraction, yet we have double space. Interestingly enough, the largest expansion is the fraction. The exponent only goes from 8 bits in 32-bit format to 11 bits in 64-bit format.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://courses.stephenmarz.comu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-64-bit-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://courses.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-64-bit-3.png 750w, https://courses.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-64-bit-3-300x50.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"><figcaption>IEEE-754, 64-bit format. 1-bit sign, 11-bit exponent, 52-bit fraction. Bias is 1023.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>64-bit IEEE-754 Examples</h3>



<p><em>Convert 0xc054_4400_0000_0000 into decimal.</em></p>



<p>We need to parse out the three fields, so as always, convert to binary:</p>



<pre>C    0    5    4    4    4    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0
1100 0000 0101 0100 0100 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000</pre>



<p>We then pick out our 1-bit sign, 11-bit exponent, and 52-bit fraction:</p>



<p>Sign = 1 = <em><strong>negative</strong></em><br>Exponent = \(1000\_0000\_101_2=1029-1023=6\)<br>Fraction = \(1.0100\_0100\_01_2\)</p>



<p>You can see that I already subtracted the 64-bit bias (1023) to get an exponent of 6, and I already added the implied 1. to the fraction. So, now our number is as follows.</p>



<p>$$-1.0100\_0100\_01_2\times 2^6=-1010001.0001_2=-88.0625_{10}$$</p>



<p>So, 0xc054_4400_0000_0000 is the value -88.0625.</p>



<h3>Another 64-bit IEEE-754 Example</h3>



<p>Convert 17.75 into 64-bit, IEEE-754 format in hexadecimal.</p>



<p>First, convert to binary: \(17.75_{10}=10001.11_2\). Then, normalize the value: \(10001.11_2\times 2^0=1.000111_2\times 2^4\). So, now we have our sign (0=positive), our exponent (4), and our fraction (.000111). Now, bias our exponent by adding \(4+1023=1027_{10}=100\_0000\_0011_2\).</p>



<pre>Sign  Exponent        Fraction
[0]   [100 0000 0011] [0001 1100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000]

0100 0000 0011 0001 1100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
4    0    3    1    C    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0</pre>



<p>So, 17.75 is 0x4031_c000_0000_0000 in 64-bit IEEE-754 format.</p>



<hr>



<h2>C++ Float/Double</h2>



<p>C++ literals are different for float and double. The literal 1.0 is a double, whereas 1.0F is a float. This allows a programmer to tell C++ whether they want a 64-bit or 32-bit floating point data type.</p>

The US is looking<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/senate-committee-vote-bill-banning-tiktok-200715190147931.html" target="_blank"> <span>"into potential national security risks as it relates to the app."</span></a>&nbsp; After the announcement, #SaveTikTok and #TikTokBan were trending. The former has 398 million views while the latter has 225 million views. This story isn't just about banning TikTok, but about how bad actors can misdirect our attention.</p><p><strong>Why Did TikTok Capture Attention?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Facebook is for Boomers, Instagram is for Millennials, and TikTok is for Gen-Z. TikTok monthly active users are about 800 million. TikTok's success boils down to a sophisticated AI that drives user engagement. As John Herrman aptly<a href="https://us.hidester.com/proxy.php?u=eJwBQQC%2B%2F3M6NTc6ItRHBViCQ175AXflK6MiidMKJoScGY6323zWCzyFh20oZ0aiWDXKwgv6ANUTHXGL8GpW7G8LKR5UzyI7YrAawQ%3D%3D&amp;b=7&amp;f=norefer" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/style/what-is-tik-tok.html" target="_blank">describes for the NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Imagine a version of Facebook that was able to fill your feed before you’d friended a single person. That’s TikTok.</em></p></blockquote><p>Taylor Lorenz <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/what-tiktok-is-cringey-and-thats-fine/573871/">writes in the Atlantic</a> what led to the initial success of TikTok:</p><blockquote><p><em>In a world where everyone’s content inevitably begins to look the same, TikTok videos feel bizarre and new. It’s an app full of people posting strange content to the internet with zero self-awareness or shame. That’s easy to mock, but it’s also what may lead to TikTok’s success.</em></p></blockquote><p>I must confess, I go on TikTok and 30-minutes later I’m still on the platform. Each video is as entertaining as the next one. The user experience reminds me of Wikipedia. I remember in middle school spending hours on Wikipedia going from one article to another. I would start by reading about Steve Jobs and end with learning about Peruvian Apple Cactus. There's even a game called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game">Wikipedia Game</a> based on this concept. The player must go from Article X to Article Y by only clicking on Wikipedia links.</p><p>I digress.</p><p>But my anecdote serves a purpose. The website kept me on there as long as possible capturing my attention.</p><p>TikTok has captured the attention of not only users but of influencers. David Dobrik, the famed YouTube influencer, exclusively produces videos on TikTok. He hasn't posted a video to YouTube since April 24th. His <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@daviddobrik?lang=en">TikTok page</a> has 19.6M followers about two million more than his YouTube page.</p><p>Established influencers aren't the only ones achieving success on the platform. No name creators go viral overnight. <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/queen-of-alt-tiktok-mooptopia-suddenly-quits-after-rapid-rise-to-fame-1392966">Mooptopia</a>, a TikTok user, went from 1,000 followers to a million followers, to quitting the platform in under two weeks.</p><p>Users and influencers love TikTok. Our government does not.</p><p><strong>What's the Big Picture?</strong></p><p>Most TikTok videos are harmless. There is a video of a<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@britishpromise.cats/video/6839416095586159878?region=PH&amp;mid=6839416100652894982&amp;u_code=d0l05f9835mcjm&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;language=en&amp;_d=dc1ghjb69gikhe&amp;share_item_id=6839416095586159878&amp;timestamp=1592478834&amp;user_id=6572491922367053826&amp;share_app_name=tiktok&amp;share_iid=6817097535460050689&amp;source=h5_t" target="_blank"> <span>cat looking into a cardboard box</span></a> with nearly 200 million views.

A massive campaign was undertaken on the platform to create fake attendees drawing a blow to the campaign.</p><p>On the surface, this seems like anti-Trump supporters playing a prank.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On the 15<sup>th</sup> of July 2020, the social media world was taken by surprise. Official accounts of major celebrities on Twitter, a platform with over 330 million monthly users, were hacked to perpetuate a Bitcoin scam. This Twitter hack involved accounts that have millions of followers and were verified. This includes accounts of Elon Musk, Apple, Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Barack Obama, Mike Bloomberg, etc.</p><p>The hackers tweeted from these official accounts asking fans and followers of the hacked celebrities to send bitcoin to specific wallet addresses with the promise of doubling it and sending back. Specifically, most of the tweets requested for $1,000 and then promised to send back $2,000. So many Twitter users and followers of these accounts fell for the scam and the stolen amount of bitcoin is said to be equivalent to over $100,000.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=640%2C407&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="407" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=640%2C407&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p><p>From findings, this hack attack was well-planned and the hackers manage to gain internal access to Twitter’s system. Once in, they took control over verified accounts and accounts with millions of followers to launch the Bitcoin scam. Hours into the hack, Twitter reacted via its support handle stating that they were aware of the situation of things.</p><p>While they investigate and look for a resolution, Twitter users were advised to reset their passwords and some other account functionalities. At some point, accounts of some users, mostly verified users, were limited from tweeting on the social media platform.</p><p>Bitcoin scams are not new on Twitter but this happens to be the biggest and most successful in years. Tweeting from different official and verified handles at the same time is enough to convince oblivious users into transferring their Bitcoin. With the decentralization and blockchain technology of Bitcoin, tracking the identity of the hacker via the public wallet address has been fruitless.</p><p><strong>Read Also: <a href="https://secureblitz.com/the-must-dos-and-donts-for-protecting-your-password-and-personal-data/">The Must Dos And Don’ts For Protecting Your Password And Personal Data</a></strong></p><p>However, an unconfirmed update from an unverified Twitter user (@inteldotwav) revealed the hacker to be Samuel Hyde, an ex-developer at Twitter. Twitter is yet to officially respond to this claim.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=441%2C632&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="441" height="632" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=209%2C300&amp;ssl=1 209w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=209%2C300&amp;ssl=1 209w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=441%2C632&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p><p>If the hack is an inside job as the tweet claims, then, the security lapse is not a fault on the victim’s part. As a Twitter user, protecting your account to avoid being a victim of a hack like this is important. Twitter features <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/two-factor-authentication">2-factor-authentication</a> which is very ideal for account protection as it adds an extra layer of security to your login. Going back to basics, your password should be very secure with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</p><div><ul><li><a href="#abh_about">Author</a></li><li><a href="#abh_posts">Recent Posts</a></li></ul><div><section itemscope="" itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><p><a href="https://secureblitz.com/author/johnray/" title="John Raymond"> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/john-raymond.jpg?w=250&amp;ssl=1" alt="John Raymond" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/john-raymond.jpg?w=250&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><div><p>John Raymond is an author, writer, and scriptwriter.

<h2>The Doves Type story.<span>&nbsp;</span></h2>


<p>The Doves Type legend is one of the most enduring in typographic history and probably the most infamous. It’s the story of a typeface and a bitter feud between the two partners of Hammersmith’s celebrated Doves Press, Thomas James Cobden-Sanderson and Emery Walker, leading to the protracted disposal of their unique metal type into London’s River Thames. Starting in 1913 with the initial dumping of the punches and matrices, by the end of January 1917 an increasingly frail Cobden-Sanderson had made hundreds of clandestine trips under cover of darkness to Hammersmith Bridge and systematically thrown 12lb parcels of metal type into the murky depths below. As one person so aptly commented on Twitter recently, this notorious tale bears all the hallmarks of a story by Edgar Allan Poe.</p>
<p>One century later and a new chapter has been added with the release of Robert Green’s digital facsimile of the Doves Type, available to <strong><a href="https://typespec.co.uk/doves-type/">buy and download from Typespec</a></strong>. For those who are still unfamiliar with the historical background and the designer’s arduous journey to salvage this beautiful typeface from its watery grave I would urge you to check out the following short BBC News film by Tom Beal, made after <a href="https://www.typespec.co.uk/recovering-the-doves-type/"><strong>the recovery in 2014 of some&nbsp;of the original type&nbsp;from the Thames:</strong></a></p>

<p>The original Doves Type was crafted by master punchcutter Edward Prince, based on drawings produced by Percy Tiffin of Nicolas Jenson’s pioneering 15th-century Venetian type. William Morris, founder of the Kelmscott Press, had actually developed his own ‘Golden’ type some years before The Doves Press came into being but Doves is held by experts as being more faithful to the original Venetian letterforms.</p>
<p>The Doves Type was commissioned in 1899 and created solely by Prince in 16 pt; it was used in all of the press’s publications including their iconic edition of the King James Bible. Each Doves Press book was beautifully bound and, notes Green, noticeably “stripped of decorative borders and illustration, the elegantly clear &amp; legible type acting alone as visual siren-song.”</p>

<p>By 1908, despite successful Milton prints &amp; the aforementioned Bible, the Press was in dire financial difficulty. Subscribers began melting away after Walker had effectively left in 1906 as the bitter &amp; acrimonious dispute took hold between the partners. On finally dissolving their partnership in 1909, Cobden-Sanderson began attempts to wriggle out of an earlier promise that, should the partnership cease, Walker would receive a fount of type ‘for his own use’. Walker retaliated, issuing a writ insisting that the Press shut down completely and he receive 50% of remaining assets. In 1909, the Press’s only valuable asset was the type.</p>
<p>A compromise was reached, brokered by their exasperated friend Sir Sydney Cockerell, which allowed Cobden-Sanderson uncontrolled use of the type for as long as he lived, at which time it would pass to Emery Walker, if he did not die first.</p>
<p>The thought of ‘his’ typeface being used by anyone else, and in a manner beyond his control, prompted Cobden-Sanderson’s now infamous course of action. Only the Doves Press, run exclusively by him, could be bestowed the honour of printing his type. And so the mission to destroy it, beginning with the punches and matrices on Good Friday 1913, began. On an almost nightly basis from August 1916 the ailing septuagenarian dumped the type into the Thames, wrapped in paper parcels and tied with string; “bequeathed to the river” as he put it in his personal diary. Every piece of this beautiful typeface, more than a ton of metal, was destroyed in a prolonged ritual sacrifice.</p>

<p>Green’s quest to re-produce the Doves Type in digital form has been a true labour of love, a project he came close to shelving on several occasions due to the paucity of (affordable) source texts and occasional blind alleys he was inadvertently taken down. Much agonising took place over the general approach to the project, deciphering the complex geometries, then individual letterform dilemmas due to ink spread inconsistencies and anomalies in the punches and matrices. The end result isn’t so much a revival as a ‘digital facsimile’ of the original typeface, but most importantly he’s succeeded in doing justice to it.</p>
<p>The first release (2013) in OpenType format was an Imprint weight, complete with ligatures and detailing from the metal predecessor; Green wanted to be as true to the original as possible but there are concessions to modern day requirements in the form of Dollar &amp; Euro currency symbols plus extended latin diacritics which didn’t feature first time around.</p>

<p>Doves Type® Regular, refined after <strong><a href="https://www.typespec.co.uk/recovering-the-doves-type/" target="_blank">recovery of the original metal type from the Thames</a>,</strong> replaces the initial 2013 release,&nbsp;improved in 2016 for contemporary usage. This <strong><a href="https://typespec.co.uk/doves-type/">latest release of the updated Doves Type®</a></strong> contains extended glyph coverage including small caps, together with both lining and tabular figures. Tracking and kerning have also been adjusted for 21st century usage. The original Doves Press type, cut for letterpress with its physical constraints and inherent quirks, contains spacing which would appear uncomfortable to modern eyes in web-based and litho applications.</p>

<p>Last week, during my weekly one-on-one with Jordan (a young sales rep), he asked me about a momentous life decision.</p>



<p>“Should I move back to the Bay Area or move to Denver?” Jordan moved back home after COVID-19 struck and was weighing his options about where to move to next.</p>



<p>My response: Don’t move to Denver if you care about your career.</p>



<p>His question was less about Denver and more about properly evaluating opportunity costs. Denver’s cost of living is astronomically lower than San Francisco’s. Plus, COVID-19 has rendered locations obsolete. You no longer need to be in the Bay Area because the virus has democratized access to tech jobs. Right?</p>



<p>Wrong!</p>



<p>The permanent shift to Remote Work is the most overhyped thing since Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Sure, COVID has caused more people to work remotely than ever before. But, central locations where people can meet in-person and collaborate will never vanish. I was on a call with a VP at Salesforce last week and he could not wait to get the hell out of his house. </p>



<p>According to Paul Graham, “One of the biggest things lost in remote work is chance meetings.”</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I know about the power of chance meetings because Y Combinator is explicitly designed to magnify it. Whenever YC brings together any group of more than about 4 founders for any reason, there ends up being an important conversation between some pair of them.</p>— Paul Graham (@paulg) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1270626376165527553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Similarly, Steve Jobs designed Pixar’s Headquarters to drive spontaneous conversations. In Walter Isaacson’s book, Jobs says “There’s a temptation in our networked age to think that ideas can be developed by email and iChat. That’s crazy. Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they’re doing, and soon you’re cooking up all sorts of ideas.”</p>



<p>This type of thinking is not exclusive to Y-Combinator and Apple. Serendipity has birthed countless groundbreaking companies in the Bay Area. Like the chance encounter that led to the first major investment in Facebook. Zuck and his crew were kickin’ it in the mean streets of Palo Alto when they ran into Sean Parker, who introduced them to Peter Thiel. He invested $500,000 in the social network. Facebook is now valued at $700 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c0c/046/73d166a28d470935ed0166d32f24bb1731-23-peter-thiel-mark-zuckerberg.2x.rhorizontal.w700.jpg" alt="" width="670" height="446"><figcaption><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html">https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.saastr.com/maybe-80-of-public-saas-companies-are-in-the-sf-bay-area/">80% of all public SaaS companies are headquartered in the Bay Area</a>. COVID has been a boon for these businesses. Have you seen the recent valuations of Zoom, Okta, Crowdstrike, and Twilio? Where do you think most of the executives at these companies live? Chances are they will propel the next wave of hypergrowth SaaS companies right here in the Bay Area. Don’t believe me?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Georg Kurtz was at McAfee before he founded CrowdStrike. Todd McKinnon led development at Salesforce before he founded Okta. Eric Yuan was the VP of Engineering at Cisco before starting Zoom.&nbsp;This is the power of being in the Bay Area. If San Francisco is the Lebron James of tech, Denver is Brian Scalabrine. </p>



<figure><img src="https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/lebron-1.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="320"><figcaption><a href="https://clutchpoints.com/nba-news-brian-scalabrine-believes-lebron-james-cavs-prepared-for-spurs-instead-of-warriors-in-2014-15-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://clutchpoints.com/nba-news-brian-scalabrine-believes-lebron-james-cavs-prepared-for-spurs-instead-of-warriors-in-2014-15-season/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>I told Jordan that Denver is more expensive than the Bay Area if he properly factors in the opportunity cost of not living in a city that would give him 10,000x the opportunities.</p>



<p>Which brings me to Short-term vs. Long-term thinking.</p>



<p>I wish someone would’ve hammered this into my brain when I was younger. When you’re in your early 20’s, your biggest asset is time. You have lots of it and can leverage the power of compounding to achieve your wildest dreams. This is why you should strictly optimize for the long-term.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“If you’re going to invent, it means you’re going to experiment, so you have to think long-term.”</p><p>Jeff Bezos</p></blockquote>



<p>Long-term compounding gives you the most leverage when it’s applied to things like investing and learning, not penny-pinching. Choosing to move to Denver instead of the Bay Area is optimizing for the cost of living which is the textbook definition of short-term thinking. Now, if Jordan had a family to support, I would be more empathetic to his contemplation of Denver over San Francisco. But, he didn’t. Call me an elitist, but if you want to have a wildly successful career in tech, saving $500 or $1000 a month on rent won’t mean shit in the long run. Especially, if the opportunity cost eradicates those savings which in Jordan’s case it would.</p>



<p>One of the best examples of long-term thinking can be found by studying business mogul Dhirubhai Ambani.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.mrobusinesstoday.com/mrobackend/assets/uploads/dhirubhai-ambani.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="251"><figcaption><a href="https://www.mrobusinesstoday.com/">https://www.mrobusinesstoday.com/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="http://doerlife.com/dhirubhai-ambani-on-networking/">He had a habit of visiting the Taj hotel</a> for a cup of tea in the evenings. But, his friends refused to join him. They thought the tea there was overpriced. After all, he was paying close to $50 for a cup of tea (at that time), whereas they would get the same tea down the road for $5. Was he out of his mind? $45 a day can add up. When they asked him about his crazy habit, he said:&nbsp;“I’m paying five bucks for the tea and another 45 bucks because the Taj gives me the opportunity to connect with the city’s most influential people.”</p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking. The world has changed. Twitter allows me to connect with anyone, anywhere in the world. I don’t need to pay for overpriced tea to have access to the most influential people. Sure. But, if you’re interested in building a successful career in tech, nothing comes close to sitting down for a cup of coffee with another founder, or VP even if you have to sit on a patio and wear facemasks. Don’t feel bad for paying a premium to access the best opportunities in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s in our nature to overreact. Unexpected changes to our lives lead us to believe that the world will never be the same.</p>



<p>When I was living in Los Angeles, I remember the night Trump sealed his victory over Hillary. I was at a birthday party, which started to feel like a funeral when two of my girlfriends started bawling their eyes out. One of my buddies said he was going to liquidate his stocks because we were headed for an epic crash. After all, Trump was unstable and there was nothing the markets hated more than instability. On top of that, people all over the internet were threatening to pack up their stuff and move to Canada.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I see our reaction to COVID through the same lens. People are overreacting to the long term changes caused by it. Has it shifted work culture to a hybrid model where you can work from anywhere? Yes. And, that’s great. If anything, It’s made humanity more resilient and to bet against human ingenuity is foolish. We’ve solved harder problems in the past and we will solve COVID.</p>



<p>Do you think people are just going to Netflix and chill and order DoorDash for the rest of their lives? That would be a sad existence. Most people I know love nothing more than spending their hard-earned dollars on experiences. And, I’m not talking about VR. </p>

<p>There’s too much money on the line for us to not figure this out. My fiancé and I just pushed our wedding to next year, which means we also pushed our honeymoon. No one is going to settle for Zoom weddings or staycation honeymoons. Even if that’s the only reason we solve COVID, we will either come up with a cure or beat this virus when everyone understands the ROI of masks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we do, the streets of SoMa are going to be bustling once again with people in Patagonia vests skipping over human feces in their Allbirds on their way to the office.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t move to Denver</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>If you’re early in your career and want to take advantage of the best opportunities in tech, there’s no place like the Bay Area. Take advantage of the same serendipity that introduced&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg to Peter Thiel.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>The fastest-growing SaaS companies are here. Executives at these companies will start the next wave of hypergrowth companies just like when Todd McKinnon left Salesforce to start Okta.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Don’t be a short-term thinker. Pay the premium to access the best opportunities in the world. You won’t be thinking about the $1000 a month you could’ve saved if you had just played it safe in your 20’s. As the saying goes, “you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” The quality of talent in the Bay Area will be the forcing mechanism you need to reach your full potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Lastly, overreacting can have serious consequences. <a href="https://thereformedbroker.com/2020/06/16/one-fifth-of-investors-sold-all-their-stocks/">18% of all Fidelity account owners</a> dumped all of their stock between February and May. They thought the world was going to end and missed one of the most epic stock markets rebounds in history. Don’t do that. </li></ul>



<p>We will beat COVID. And, when we do, a chance meeting in San Francisco can lead to the biggest opportunity of your career.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For the Dashbit website, we wanted to avoid tracking users as much as possible. This means no cookies and unfortunately most analytics use cookies for tracking and/or fingerprinting. However, we still want to see which pages on our website are being frequently accessed. For this purpose, we have decided to roll our own analytics system.</p>
<p>
In this article, we will cover how we implemented the analytics system with Ecto upserts and how we have used the Elixir registry and Elixir processes to reduce the pressure on the database.</p>
<h2>
Tracking with upserts</h2>
<p>
The idea is very simple: every time someone accesses a page, we will store this information in the database. However, we don’t need to track each access at the instant they happen. For us, tracking how many accesses a page had in a day is completely fine. Therefore, every time a page is accessed on a given date, we will attempt to insert an entry in the database. If an entry already exists, we update its counter instead.</p>
<p>
Luckily, this can be done with an upsert in Ecto. Let’s first define the schema for the database resource:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>MyApp.Metrics.Metric</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Ecto.Schema</span><span>

  </span><span>@primary_key</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>
  </span><span>schema</span><span> </span><span>"metrics"</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:counter</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-2">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="6781915709-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
It has three fields: a date, the page path, and the counter (number of accesses). The date and path make a composite primary key. Our migration looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Repo.Migrations.CreateMetrics</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Ecto.Migration</span><span>

      </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-2">end</span><span>

<p>
The code above performs an upsert, incrementing the number of accesses in a page by the value of <code>counter</code>, which is typically 1. If an entry does not exist, one is immediately created.</p>
<p>
This is the core of our analytics. It is a very straight-forward solution, but it does have a strong requirement on the database accepting all of our writes. While most applications heavily rely on a database, the analytics system is the only place in our website that uses a database, so we believe it is important to show an article, such as this blog post, even if there is an error when talking to the storage layer. To address this, we have decided to move the upserts to separate processes.</p>
<h2>
Async and batched writes with processes</h2>
<p>
As laid out in the previous section, we want to move all the database writes done by our analytics code to a separate process. Another concern we have with our solution so far is how it will handle overloads. If there is a huge spike in traffic, could we end up putting too much pressure in the database? In this sense, would it be a good idea to batch our writes?</p>
<p>
To be honest, our application will be just fine with spikes. Most of our page loads are within hundreds of microseconds, thanks to Phoenix, and our database usage is minimal. On the other hand, such a small project is a perfect opportunity to experiment, so we decided to explore how our analytics solution would look like if we performed writes asynchronously and in batches.</p>
<p>
Here is what we came up with. Every time a user accesses a page, we will spawn an Elixir process that tracks all accesses to that page. If a process already exists for said page, we will message the existing process instead. The goal of this process is to collect all accesses within a time interval, writing to the database after X seconds.</p>
<p>
We are going to call this the <code>Worker</code> process and it starts like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Worker</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5734826703-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>GenServer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>restart</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:temporary</span></code></pre>
<p>
We define a module for the process and declare it as a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html"><code>GenServer</code></a>. We also say that this process is <code>:temporary</code>. I.e. if it dies, we don’t want the supervisor to restart it. That’s because we are assuming that, if the process dies, our logic that dynamically spawns processes for each page will eventually start a new one anyway.</p>
<p>
Next we define the <code>init</code> callback of the process:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>init</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-1">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>flag</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-3">(</span><span>:trap_exit</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-3">)</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-4">{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-5">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_counter</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-5">}</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-4">}</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>init</code> callback traps exits and sets the process state to <code>{path, 0}</code>. The first element is the page path, the second element is the number of page visits.</p>
<p>
Our process should be able to receive a <code>:bump</code> message. This message is sent whenever we need to bump the counter and is handled by the <code>handle_info</code> callback:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>handle_info</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-1">(</span><span>:bump</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-2">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-2">}</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-3">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-9">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
If we receive the <code>:bump</code> when the page had no access (i.e. counter is zero), we will bump the counter to 1 and we will also schedule an upsert event, so we eventually write those accesses to the database. If the counter is more than 0, we simply bump it and return an updated state.</p>
<p>
The scheduling and upsert code will look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>defp</span><span> </span><span>schedule_upsert</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-1">(</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-2">do</span><span>

    </span><span># same function as the previous section</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-13">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>schedule_upsert()</code> function schedules a message to the current process (<code>self()</code>). The message will be named <code>:upsert</code> and it will be delivered in a random value between 10s to 20s. The reason we picked a random value is to avoid a scenario where multiple processes for different pages are spawned at the same time and they all write to the database at the same time.</p>
<p>
Next we define another <code>handle_info</code> clause, this time to handle the scheduled <code>:upsert</code> message. This clause simply invokes the <code>upsert!</code> function, defined in the previous section, and resets the state back to <code>{path, 0}</code>. This makes it so that, once there is a new bump, we will schedule a new upsert.</p>
<p>
Finally, we implement the <code>terminate</code> callback, which will be invoked whenever our application is shutting down:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>terminate</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-1">(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1299229119-2">{</span><span>_path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-2">}</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-1">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:ok</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>terminate</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-3">(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1299229119-4">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-4">}</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-3">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>upsert!</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-5">(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-5">)</span><span>
</span><span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>
If our application is shutting down, we may have pending writes in our worker, so we want to send them to the database as part of our termination logic. One important thing to remember is that the <code>terminate</code> callback is not called by default when shutting down, unless you are trapping exits. That’s why we called <code>Process.flag(:trap_exit, true)</code> in the <code>init</code> function.</p>
<p>
The process we just implemented delivers all of the requirements we have so far: writes are now asynchronous, as they happen in a separate process, and they are also batched, using intervals between 10s and 20s. The last step we need to implement is to actually spawn those processes on the fly as users navigate through the website.</p>
<h2>
Dynamic processes with the Elixir registry</h2>
<p>
In order to spawn and find processes for each page, we are going to use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Registry.html">Elixir’s <code>Registry</code></a>. We also need a dynamic supervisor which is going to be the parent of all worker processes. Let’s implement this logic in the overaching <code>Metrics</code> module, alongside our <code>bump(page)</code> function.</p>
<p>
Let’s get started with the basics:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8546136914-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Supervisor</span><span>

  </span><span>@worker</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Worker</span><span>
  </span><span>@registry</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Registry</span><span>
  </span><span>@supervisor</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.WorkerSupervisor</span></code></pre>
<p>
Our <code>Dashbit.Metrics</code> module is a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html"><code>Supervisor</code></a>, which will have two children: the registry and the supervisor of all workers. Since the workers are started dynamically, as requests come, we will use a <code>DynamicSupervisor</code>. We store the names of the worker, registry and dynamic supervisor processes in module attributes for convenience.</p>
<p>
Next we will define how our supervisor is started and its <code>init</code> callback:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>start_link</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-1">(</span><span>_opts</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-2">do</span><span>

  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-5">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
With the registry and dynamic supervisor in place, we can write the bump function:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>bump</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-1">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-1">)</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>is_binary</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-2">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-2">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1140714578-3">do</span><span>

<p>
The <code>bump</code> function looks up in the registry if there is a process for the given path and returns its process identifier (<code>pid</code>). If one does not exist, we ask the worker supervisor to start a worker dynamically. We expect two possible outcomes from <code>start_child</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
<code>{:ok, pid}</code> - the worker was started    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<code>{:error, {:already_started, pid}}</code> - a worker for the given <code>path</code> already exists    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
We need the second branch to address a potential race condition where two users may access a page for the first time at the same time. In this scenario, the <code>Registry.lookup/2</code> will fail for both them, and both will attempt to spawn the worker. One of them will succeed and the other will return the “already started” error. Once we find the <code>pid</code>, we send it the <code>:bump</code> message.</p>
<p>
We are almost there. There are just two steps left. …</p></article></div></div>

<br><h3>Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler, part 1</h3><p><small>5/5/2020</small></p><p>

<img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/knightdragon.jpg"></p><p><i>This is the first post in a three part series. Check out <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler2.html">part 2</a> and <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html">part 3</a> when you are ready.</i></p>

<p>It is a beautiful day outside, so let's make a compiler. You don't need any knowledge of how compilers work to follow along. We are going to use Python to implement our own programming language, Teeny Tiny, that will compile to C code. It will take about 500 lines of code and provide the initial infrastructure needed to customize and extend the compiler into your own billion dollar production-ready compiler.</p>

<p>This tutorial is a series of posts that go step by step in building a working compiler. All of the source code can be found in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler">repo</a>. If you follow along with all the posts, I guesstimate that it will take you only a few hours.

</p><p>The Teeny Tiny language we are going to implement is a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>. The syntax is clean and simple. If you prefer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>-like syntax then it will be trivial to modify the compiler at the end.  Here is an example program in our Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<pre>PRINT "How many fibonacci numbers do you want?"
INPUT nums

LET a = 0
LET b = 1
WHILE nums &gt; 0 REPEAT
    PRINT a
    LET c = a + b
    LET a = b
    LET b = c
    LET nums = nums - 1
ENDWHILE	
</pre>

<p>This program prints out terms of the fibonacci sequence based on the user's input: 0 1 1 2 3 5 13...</p>

<p>Our language will allow a variety of the basic operations that you'd expect from a programming language. In particular, it will support:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Numerical variables</li>
	<li>Basic arithmetic</li>
	<li>If statements</li>
	<li>While loops</li>
	<li>Print text and numbers</li>
	<li>Input numbers</li>
	<li>Labels and goto</li>
	<li>Comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this is a standard subset of features, you may notice that there are no functions, no arrays, no way to read/write from a file, and not even an else statement. But with just this small set of constructs, you can actually do a lot. It will also setup the compiler in such a way that many other features will be straight forward to add later.</p>

<h4>Compiler Overview</h4>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/compilersteps.png"></p><p>Our compiler will follow a three step process that is illustrated above. First, given the inputted source code, it will break the code up into <i>tokens</i>. These are like words and punctuation in English. Second, it will <i>parse</i> the tokens to make sure they are in an order that is allowed in our language. Just like English sentences follow specific structures of verbs and nouns. Third, it will <i>emit</i> the C code that our language will translate to.</p>

<p>We will use these three steps as the main organization for our code. The lexer, parser, and emitter will each have their own Python code file. This tutorial is broken up into 3 parts based on these steps as well. If you were to extend the compiler, there are some additional steps you would add, but we will hold off on discussing those.</p>



<h4>Lexer Overview</h4>

<p>The first module of our compiler is called the <i>lexer</i>. Given a string of Teeny Tiny code, it will iterate character by character to do two things: decide where each token starts/stops and what type of token it is. If the lexer is unable to do this, then it will report an error for an invalid token.</p>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/tokens.png"></p><p>The figure demonstrates an example input and output of the lexer. Given the Teeny Tiny code, the lexer must determine where the tokens are along with the type (e.g., keyword). You can see that spaces aren't recognized as tokens, but the lexer will use them as one way to know when a token ends.</p>

<p>Let's finally get into some code, starting with the structure of the lexer in the file <b>lex.py</b>:</p>

<pre>class Lexer:
    def __init__(self, input):
        pass

    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        pass

    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        pass

    # Invalid token found, print error message and exit.
    def abort(self, message):
        pass
		
    # Skip whitespace except newlines, which we will use to indicate the end of a statement.
    def skipWhitespace(self):
        pass
		
    # Skip comments in the code.
    def skipComment(self):
        pass

    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        pass
</pre>

<p>I like to sketch out all the functions that I think I will need, then go back and fill them in. The function <b>getToken</b> will be the meat of the lexer. It will be called each time the compiler is ready for the next token and it will do the work of classifying tokens. <b>nextChar</b> and <b>peek</b> are helper functions for looking at the next character. <b>skipWhitespace</b> consumes the spaces and tabs that we don't care about. <b>abort</b> is what we will use to report an invalid token.</p>

<p>The lexer needs to keep track of the current position in the input string and the character at that position. We will initialize these in the constructor:</p>

<pre>    def __init__(self, input):
        self.source = input + '\n' # Source code to lex as a string. Append a newline to simplify lexing/parsing the last token/statement.
        self.curChar = ''   # Current character in the string.
        self.curPos = -1    # Current position in the string.
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>The lexer needs the input code and we append a newline to it (this just simplifies some checks later on). <b>curChar</b> is what the lexer will constantly check to decide what kind of token it is. Why not just do <i>source[curPos]</i>? Because that would litter the code with bounds checking. Instead we do this in <b>nextChar</b>:</p>

<pre>    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        self.curPos += 1
        if self.curPos &gt;= len(self.source):
            self.curChar = '\0'  # EOF
        else:
            self.curChar = self.source[self.curPos]
</pre>

<p>This increments the lexer's current position and updates the current character. If we reach the end of the input, set the character to the end-of-file marker. This is the only place we will modify curPos and curChar. But sometimes we want to look ahead to the next character without updating curPos:</p>

<pre>    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        if self.curPos + 1 &gt;= len(self.source):
            return '\0'
        return self.source[self.curPos+1]
</pre>

<p>We should make sure these functions work. Let's test them by create a new file <b>teenytiny.py</b>:</p>

<pre>from lex import *

def main():
	input = "LET foobar = 123"
	lexer = Lexer(input)

	while lexer.peek() != '\0':
		print(lexer.curChar)
		lexer.nextChar()

main()
</pre>

<p>Run this and the output should be every character of the input string, <i>LET foobar = 123</i>, on a new line:</p>

<pre>L
E 
T 

f 
o 
o 
b 
a 
r 

= 

1 
2 
3 

</pre>

<h4>Classifying Tokens</h4>

<p>But we don't just want characters, we want tokens! We need to plan how combining individual characters together makes a token, which works much like a state machine. Here are the main lexer rules for the Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operator. One or two consecutive characters that matches: + - * / = == != &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=</li>
	<li>String. Double quotation followed by zero or more characters and a double quotation. Such as: "hello, world!" and ""</li>
	<li>Number. One or more numeric characters followed by an optional decimal point and one or more numeric characters. Such as: 15 and 3.14</li>
	<li>Identifier. An alphabetical character followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters.</li>
	<li>Keyword. Exact text match of: LABEL, GOTO, PRINT, INPUT, LET, IF, THEN, ENDIF, WHILE, REPEAT, ENDWHILE</li>
</ul>

<p>Next we will start our <b>getToken</b> function in our <b>Lexer</b> class:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            pass	# Plus token.
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            pass	# Minus token.
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            pass	# Asterisk token.
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            pass	# Slash token.
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            pass	# Newline token.
        elif self.curChar == '\0':
            pass	# EOF token.
        else:
            # Unknown token!
            pass
			
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>This will detect a few possible tokens, but doesn't do anything useful yet. What we need next is a <b>Token</b> class to keep track of what type of token it is and the exact text from the code. Place this in <b>Lex.py</b> for now:</p>

<pre># Token contains the original text and the type of token.
class Token:   
    def __init__(self, tokenText, tokenKind):
        self.text = tokenText   # The token's actual text. Used for identifiers, strings, and numbers.
        self.kind = tokenKind   # The TokenType that this token is classified as.
</pre>

<p>To specify what type a token is, we will create the <b>TokenType</b> class as an enum. It looks long, but it just specifies every possible token our language allows. Add <i>import enum</i> to the top of <b>Lex.py</b> and add this class:</p>

<pre># TokenType is our enum for all the types of tokens.
class TokenType(enum.Enum):
	EOF = -1
	NEWLINE = 0
	NUMBER = 1
	IDENT = 2
	STRING = 3
	# Keywords.
	LABEL = 101
	GOTO = 102
	PRINT = 103
	INPUT = 104
	LET = 105
	IF = 106
	THEN = 107
	ENDIF = 108
	WHILE = 109
	REPEAT = 110
	ENDWHILE = 111
	# Operators.
	EQ = 201  
	PLUS = 202
	MINUS = 203
	ASTERISK = 204
	SLASH = 205
	EQEQ = 206
	NOTEQ = 207
	LT = 208
	LTEQ = 209
	GT = 210
	GTEQ = 211
</pre>

<p>Now we can expand <b>getToken</b> to actually do something when it detects a specific token:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        token = None

        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.PLUS)
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.MINUS)
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.ASTERISK)
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.SLASH)
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            token = …</pre></div></div></div>

              <p><i><p>“Probably only at the very beginning of an industry do you have the kind of work that some of us did at Genentech early on.... The entire industry is at a different stage now.

                <p>In the early days at Genentech one or two or three people could do the major amount of work to take an idea to the compound that was a drug.”</p>
                <p>- David Goeddel, 2001, as interviewed by Sally Smith Hughes <sup>1</sup></p>
                </i>
              </p>
              
          </div>
          <p>A <a href="https://www.baybridgebio.com/blog/young_founders_1.html">previous post</a> showed that, historically, young CEOs are capable of building very successful biotech <sup>2</sup> companies.  If that’s the case, why do so few young biotech CEOs get funded today?</p>
          <p>There are many valid reasons for preferring experienced CEOs: they are used to the level of rigor of industrial science, have experience managing drug discovery programs, understand the drug discovery and development process, have extensive networks, have experience with FDA, and have a nose for commercially viable science.</p>
          <p>There are also many valid reasons for preferring younger CEOs: they are closer to the latest science and technology, they are less constrained by conventional ways of thinking, and they bring fresh perspectives, optimism and ambition.</p>
          <p>Some companies, like asset-centric virtual startups, are probably best run by experienced CEOs.  But young, technical CEOs are probably well suited to build the next gene editing or synthetic biology platform.</p>
          <p>Both experienced and inexperienced entrepreneurs have strengths and weaknesses.  But the industry today seems to disproportionately emphasize the virtues of experience and undervalue the virtues of youth.  The industry is structured to turbocharge the strengths of experienced entrepreneurs and build support systems to complement their weaknesses.  But there don't seem to be as many groups that put young technical founders front-and-center, and build support systems to compensate for their lack of experience and networks.</p>
          <p>Why is this?  I hypothesize that the industry’s current preference for experienced CEOs is a rational response to the “dark ages” of the late 1990s and 2000s, one of the most challenging environments ever for biotech VC and pharma R&amp;D (the industry seems to have emerged from this period, and that's the topic of the next post):</p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Eroom's Law</b> put the cost of developing a drug out of reach of cash-strapped startups.</li>
              <li>A <b>conservative FDA</b> was approving fewer new drugs, and big companies were better able to absorb regulatory risk than were startups.</li>
              <li>The breakthrough technologies of the turn of the century – gene and cell therapy 1.0, antisense therapy, the sequencing of the human genome – that could have fueled the next wave of startups proved to be more <b>hype than reality</b> <sup>3</sup>.</li>
              <li>The <b>exit environment was challenging</b>, so it was hard for biotech venture investors to make money.</li>
              <li>The "low-hanging fruit" of drug discovery was picked, and as discovery projects became more complex, skilled managers increased in importance relative to highly productive individual contributors.</li>
              <li>Investors became more risk-averse in response to these challenges.  <b>Investors reduced “management risk” by not funding young CEOs</b>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Another unfortunate side effect of this challenging time was that an entire generation of would-be entrepreneurs, investors and industry scientists never got training in industrial biotech or exposure to how science-based companies were built.  Pharma was cutting R&amp;D, biotech companies weren’t taking big science risk, and investors were abandoning biotech.  This depleted the stock of promising young scientists with industry training -- the exact kind of person you'd hope to fund as an entrepreneur.</p>

          <br>
          <h3>Biotech's "dark age"</h3>
          <p>The period from the late 1970s to early 1990s was a boom time for biotech startups, with startups like Genentech, Amgen and Biogen using recombinant DNA technology to create a whole new class of medicines.  These startups, initially viewed as crazy by established pharma companies, ultimately reshaped the industry.  This “golden age of molecular biology” peaked in the 1980s and saw the creation of many large and lasting companies.</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/founding_date_valuation.png"></p><p>The period from 1995 to today was a different story.  Only six $10B+ biotherapeutics companies have been started since 1995 (Actelion, BioMarin, Pharmasset, Seattle Genetics, Kite and Juno), and only two have been started since 2000 (Kite and Juno).  Of course, it takes time for these companies to grow to such valuations, so there are probably some companies founded recently that will get to that level in time (Alnylam is nearly at a $10B market cap and was founded in 2002; John Maragone, the first CEO, was 38 at the time).  But compared to the 1970s and 1980s, the 1990s and 2000s were a challenging time for ambitious biotech startups and their investors.</p>
          <p>Why was this period so challenging?</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Declining R&amp;D productivity and "Eroom's Law"</h3>
          <p>A major driver of the struggles of biotech and pharma was, and continues to be, ever-decreasing returns to R&amp;D investment.  The number of approved drugs per dollar of R&amp;D spent is on a steady, long-term decline (chart from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3681">Scannell et al, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2012</a>):</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/erooms_nature_2012.png"></p><p>This phenomenon is “Eroom’s Law” (“Moore’s Law” backwards): the cost of developing a drug increases exponentially over time, despite dramatic improvements in efficiency at various steps of the drug development process (some of these efficiency gains approximating Moore’s Law) <sup>4</sup>.</p>
          <p>This drop in R&amp;D productivity, combined with the <a href="https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/drug-patent-expirations-and-the-patent-cliff">“patent cliff”</a> where a huge wave of blockbuster drugs all lost patent protection within a few years, led to the first ever year of <a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/regulatory/behold-patent-cliff-u-s-drug-market-shrinks-for-first-time">declining US revenue</a> for the pharma industry in 2012.  Pharma companies responded to these challenges with <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2011/12/pharma-industry-crisis">massive layoffs</a>: some estimated that <a href="https://xconomy.com/national/2013/02/18/biotech-pharma-whining-about-talent-should-look-in-the-mirror/">150,000 pharma employees were laid off from 2009-2012</a>.  These layoffs, combined with a general investor retreat from biotech, made it very difficult for young scientists to get training in the business of building and investing in science-driven companies.</p>
          <p>The point of all this is that by the 2000s, drug development had become more expensive than the industry had anticipated, and you couldn’t take a drug from bench to bedside on a startup or academic budget.  So startups focused on less expensive, <a href="https://xconomy.com/national/2012/07/02/whos-still-active-among-the-early-stage-biotech-vcs/">later-stage</a> projects, like reformulations / repurposing, orphan drugs, or lower-risk development plans.  These were not the kinds of projects that would become $10B+ companies.</p>
          <p>A corollary to this is that as the low-hanging fruit was picked, companies had to work harder for new drugs (as mentioned in the opening quote of this paper).  In the early days of biotech, a few smart, dedicated scientists could make a drug.  Genentech's first products were recombinant versions of proteins that were already known to be therapeutic, and that were relatively simple to clone.  After that, they had to tackle targets with less well-understood biology, or create drugs with more complex structures.  As complexity grew, research teams grew in size, and the importance of experienced managers increased in relation to highly productive individual contributors.</p>
          <p>Around the turn of the century, new technologies like antisense therapy, gene therapy, cell therapy and genomic medicine promised to create new therapeutic white space that nimble startups were well-suited to explore.  Unfortunately, these technologies did not prove ready for prime time.  The first gene therapies, engineered cell therapies and antisense therapies were approved by FDA just in the last few years, despite significant hype around these technologies as far back as the 1990s.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Fewer FDA Approvals</h3>
          <p>Simultaneously, FDA was approving fewer new drugs (chart from <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-approvals/new-drug-approvals-fall-to-six-year-low-in-2016-idUKKBN14M08R">Reuters</a>).</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/fda_approvals_1993_to_2017.png"></p><p>During the 2000s, FDA was approving roughly half the number of drugs per year as it has been since ~2012.  While FDA issues certainly affected big pharma as well as startups, an FDA delay could easily kill a startup, while big companies could generally absorb the blow.</p>
          <p>Part of this may have been a function of declining R&amp;D productivity (ie pharma was not submitting as many quality drugs for approval, so fewer would be approved; I don’t have data on FDA approval rates going back decades), but FDA anecdotally seemed more conservative during the 2000s than today (understandably, given things like Vioxx’s undisclosed cardiovascular risks and patient deaths).</p>

          <h3>Challenging exit environment compressing VC returns</h3>
          <p>The 2000s was also a tough decade for IPOs and M&amp;A.  In order for investors and entrepreneurs to make money, startups need to “exit”: typically by either selling the startup to a bigger company, or “going public” through an IPO, allowing them to sell stock to the public.  If the IPO and M&amp;A markets are not accommodating, it can be very hard for investors to make money.</p>

          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/biotech_ipos_historically.png"></p><p>After a booming period from 1991-2000 that saw an average of 30 biotech IPOs a year (including the outlier year 2000), the decade from 2001-2010 saw IPOs fall to a third of that level <sup>5</sup>.  For most of the 2000s, an IPO was not a realistic possibility for most companies.</p>
          <p>Pharma M&amp;A activity was healthier than the IPO market in the 2000s-2010s, but compared to today, valuations were lower, and pharma typically only spent big money on late stage assets (chart from <a href="https://lifescivc.com/2016/09/saluting-biotech-ma-onward-upward/">Bruce Booth / LifeSciVC blog</a>).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Infinite-Polynomial.jpg" alt="Infinite Limits &amp; Polynomial End-Behavior" width="800" height="480" title="Infinite Polynomial" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Infinite-Polynomial.jpg"></p><p>Regardless of your&nbsp;early surrounding&nbsp;or&nbsp;schooling&nbsp;background, we know for one that there are two kinds of <em>mathematical objects</em> that are kind of hard to miss in life. The names? <strong>Polynomial</strong> and <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#infinite"><strong>infinity</strong></a>! While the former&nbsp;might have sounded a bit like the name of a <em>snake</em>, polynomials is a <em>one-of-its-kind</em> mathematical entity whose perfection defies our mathematical imagination.</p><p>For one, polynomials are well-known for being&nbsp;<em>infinitely smooth</em> and <em>never-ending</em>, while at the same time, they could be a <em>line</em>, a <em>parabola</em>, or any&nbsp;kind of weird, <strong>infinitely-malleable curve</strong>&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;assume&nbsp;any shape drawn without <em>lifting</em> the pencil (kind of). Heck, polynomials are a&nbsp;favorite object of <em>platonic desire</em> among math enthusiasts. Talk about the <em>interaction</em> between polynomial and infinity!</p><p>So with all that goodness, it makes sense for us to inquire a bit as to why despite of having similar forms, the behaviors of polynomials at the infinities differ, leading to some seemingly unrelated insights about their <strong>properties</strong> in general.</p><p>All right. Enough said. Time to buckle the seat belt, and let the theoretical musing begins! <span id="more-7079"></span></p><h2 id="poly"><span id="Polynomials_%E2%80%94_A_Review"></span><a href="#toc">Polynomials — A Review</a><span></span></h2><p>A <em>non-zero</em>,&nbsp;real-valued function of the form $\displaystyle&nbsp;cx^n$ — where $c \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \}$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ — forms the building blocks of polynomials. For that reason, they are usually called the (non-zero)<strong> monomials</strong>, with&nbsp;the number $n$ being the <strong>degree</strong> of the monomial in question. For example, the <em>constant function</em> $\frac{\pi}{4}$ represents a monomial with degree $0$, whereas the function $ex^{666}$ would be a monomial with degree $666$ (!).</p><p>(for the record, the <em>zero function</em> also falls into the category of monomials, except that its degree is usually left <em>undefined</em>, for the obvious reason that it can be expressed <em>numerous</em> forms).</p><p>Once there, we can define a <strong>non-zero polynomial</strong> as a function of the form:</p><p>\begin{align*} f_1(x)+ \dots + f_m(x) \end{align*}</p><p>where $m \in \mathbb{N_+}$ (i.e., a <em>positive</em> integer) and each $f_i(x)$ is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>non-zero</em> monomial.</p><p>In which&nbsp;case, we define the <strong>degree</strong> of a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial as the <em>maximal</em> degree of its monomials (always well-defined, since there’s only a <em>finite</em> number of&nbsp;monomials). For example, the constant function $\frac{\ln 2 + 3}{2e}$ represents&nbsp;a polynomial of degree $0$, and&nbsp;the function $3 + 2x^3 + x + x^2$ a polynomial of degree $3$.</p><p>(as with before, the <em>zero function</em>&nbsp;still falls into the category of polynomials, with the caveat that its degree is usually left undefined — due to the ambiguity of its leading term)</p><p>For the sake of <em>simplicity</em> and <em>consistency</em> though, we usually prefer to write a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial by gathering up the <em>like terms</em>, and rearranging the resulting terms so that the monomials are presented in increasing/decreasing order based on&nbsp;their degrees. Once that’s done, we refer to the monomial of the highest degree as the <strong>leading term</strong> of the polynomial, and its coefficient the <strong>leading coefficient</strong> of the polynomial.</p><p>For example, instead of writing $10x^3+2x^2+ 5x+ 6x^2 + 5 + 2 x^3$ as our polynomial, we prefer to regroup the like terms and rewrite it as $12x^3 + 8x^2 + 5x + 5$, from which it can be seen&nbsp;that we have a polynomial of <em>degree</em> $3$ (i.e., a <strong>cubic polynomial</strong>) — with $12$ as&nbsp;the <em>leading coefficient</em>.</p><p>In general, a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial can have <em>any</em> non-zero number as leading coefficient. However, in the special case where the leading coefficient is $1$, it is as if it it&nbsp;kind of disappears out of sight.&nbsp;In which case, we refer to the said polynomial as a <strong>monic polynomial</strong>.</p><p>In addition, since&nbsp;every <em>non-zero</em> polynomial can be re-expressed in terms of<em>&nbsp;monic polynomial</em>&nbsp;by <em>factoring out</em> the leading coefficient,&nbsp;it sometimes makes sense to&nbsp;analyze the properties of a non-zero polynomial by looking instead at the properties&nbsp;of its <em>underlying&nbsp;monic polynomial</em>.</p><p>Alternatively, we can also define a polynomial <em>recursively</em>&nbsp;as follows:</p><div id=""><p>Definition 1 — Recursive Definition of Polynomial</p><div><p><em>A&nbsp;real-valued</em> function $p(x)$ is a <strong>polynomial</strong> if and only if it satisfies one of the two following options — through a <em>finite</em> number of iterations:</p><ol><li>$p(x)=c$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$ (i.e., a <em>constant function</em>).</li><li>$p(x) = x q(x) + c$, where $q(x)$ is a <em>polynomial</em> and $c \in \mathbb{R}$.</li></ol></div></div><p>For example, $x^2 + 2x + 1$ is a polynomial by the standard of this&nbsp;<em>recursive definition</em>, since $x^2+2x+1 = x ( x+2) + 1$, where $x+2$ is very well a polynomial (why?) and $1$ very well a constant. In general, the recursive definition of polynomial suggests a way of <em>reducing</em> a polynomial of degree $n+1$ to that of degree $n$ — an handy insight when it comes to proving facts about <em>non-zero</em> polynomials using the so-called&nbsp;<strong>mathematical induction</strong> on the <em>degree</em> of polynomials.</p><h2 id="inflim"><span id="A_Venture_Into_the_Infinite_Limits"></span><a href="#toc">A Venture Into the&nbsp;Infinite Limits</a><span></span></h2><p>When tackling the behavior of a function at the infinities, it makes sense that we equip ourselves with some <strong>limit laws</strong>&nbsp;on how <em>infinity-converging</em> and <em>constant-converging</em> functions&nbsp;interact with each other. To that end, we present the following&nbsp;<em>6</em> sets of&nbsp;limit laws for your pleasure. 🙂</p><h3 id="constantfunction"><span id="Interactions_Between_InfinityConverging_and_Constant_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Interactions Between Infinity-Converging and Constant Functions</a><span></span></h3><p>To start off, let’s imagine that we have a function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, where $f \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$. The question is, what does the function $f(x) + c$ tends to — if any&nbsp;— as $x \to \infty$?</p><p>Here, it shouldn’t be a surprise that $f(x)+c$ converges to $\infty$ as well. To see why, we first note that since $f \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$, the <strong>definition of limit</strong> implies that:</p><blockquote><h6>Given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number — however <em>large</em> — there’ll always be <em>some</em>&nbsp;<strong>neighborhood</strong> $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc, \infty)$, such that every member&nbsp;in $f(N)$ <em>exceeds</em> this number.</h6></blockquote><p>This means that&nbsp;given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number $r$, it would then be&nbsp;possible to find one such&nbsp;<em>neighborhood</em> $N$ such that $f(x) &gt; r – c$ for all $x \in N$. In which case, we would have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) + c &gt; &nbsp;r \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>thereby&nbsp;showing that the function $f(x) + c$ increases&nbsp;<em>beyond bound</em>&nbsp;as $x \to \infty$ — regardless of the value of&nbsp;$c$.</p><p>Naturally, this leads to the following question: what if $f$ actually converges to $-\infty$ instead as&nbsp;$x \to \infty$? Well, referring to the <em>definition of limit</em> again,&nbsp;we have that:</p><blockquote><h6>Given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number — however <em>negative</em>&nbsp;— there’ll always be <em>some</em>&nbsp;<strong>neighborhood</strong> $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc, \infty)$, such that every member&nbsp;in $f(N)$ <em>precedes</em>&nbsp;this number.</h6></blockquote><p>This means that&nbsp;given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number $r$, it would then be&nbsp;possible to find one such&nbsp;<em>neighborhood</em> $N$ such that $f(x) &lt; r – c$ for all $x \in N$. In which case, we would have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) + c &lt; r \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>hence&nbsp;showing that the function $f(x) + c$ decreases&nbsp;<em>beyond bound</em>&nbsp;$x \to \infty$, and this again regardless of the <em>sign</em> and <em>size</em> of&nbsp;$c$. Putting everything together, we obtain&nbsp;our <em>first</em> set of limit laws concerning <strong>constant functions</strong>:</p><div id=""><p>Proposition 1 — Limit Laws Concerning Constant Functions (Sum)</p><p>Given a <em>real-valued</em> function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, if as $x \to \Box$ (where $\Box$ could be a number, $+\infty$ or $-\infty$), $f(x)$ converges to one of the infinities, then the function&nbsp;$f(x)+c$ converges to the <em>same</em> infinity $f(x)$ converges to — as $x \to \Box$.</p></div><p>Now, what about the cases where a function is <em>multiplied</em> by a constant, as in the case of $c f(x)$ where $c&gt;0$? Well, as logic would have dictated, the <strong>convergence behavior</strong> of $c f(x)$ should&nbsp;depend on what $f(x)$ converges to in the first place.</p><p>For example, if we know in advance that $f(x)$ converges to $\infty$ as $x \to \infty$, then the definition of limit would imply that given <em>any</em> number $r$ — no matter how&nbsp;<em>positive</em>&nbsp;— we can always&nbsp;find a neighborhood $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc,\infty)$ such that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) &amp; &gt; \frac{r}{c} \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>That is,</p><p>\begin{align*} cf(x) &amp; &gt; r &nbsp;\qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>showing that the function $cf(x)$ increases <em>without bound</em> as $x \to \infty$.</p><p>On the other hand, if $f(x) \to -\infty$ instead as $x \to \infty$ (remember that $c&gt;0$), then we can similarly infer that given <em>any</em> number $r$ — however&nbsp;<em>negative</em> — it is always possible to find a neighborhood $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc,\infty)$ such that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) &amp; &lt; \frac{r}{c} \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>That is,</p><p>\begin{align*} cf(x) &amp; &lt; r &nbsp;\qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>showing that the function $cf(x)$ decreases&nbsp;<em>without bound</em> as $x \to \infty$.</p><p>Now, this still leaves us with the scenario&nbsp;where $c$ is <em>negative</em>. In which case, using very similar&nbsp;arguments, it can still&nbsp;be shown that as $x \to \infty$:</p><ol><li>$f(x) \to +\infty$ implies that $cf(x) \to -\infty$.</li><li>$f(x) \to -\infty$ implies that $cf(x) \to +\infty$.</li></ol><p>So that if we combine these insights together, we get our <em>second</em> set of limit laws concerning <strong>constant functions</strong>:</p><div id=""><p>Proposition 2 — Limit Laws Concerning Constant Functions (Product)</p><div><p>Given a <em>real-valued</em> function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, if as $x \to \Box$ (where $\Box$ could be a number, $+\infty$ or $-\infty$), $f(x)$ converges to one of the infinities, then the following cases apply as $x \to \Box$:</p><ol><li>If $c&gt;0$, then $c f(x)$ converges to the <em>same</em> infinity $f(x)$ converges to.</li><li>If $c&lt;0$, then $c f(x)$ converges to the <em>opposite</em>&nbsp;infinity $f(x)$ converges to.</li></ol></div></div><p>Interestingly, the above&nbsp;limit laws applies <em>irrespective of the size of $c$</em>. For example, $c$ could be $0.00001$ and $f(x)$ could converge to $+\infty$, and $cf(x)$ would have converged to $+\infty$ regardless. Likewise, $c$ could be $\frac{1}{e}$ and $f(x)$ could converge to $-\infty$, and $cf(x)$ would have converged to $-\infty$ regardless.</p><h3 id="infpluscon"><span id="Infinity_+_Constant"></span><a href="#toc">Infinity + Constant</a><span></span></h3><p>Moving from the constant functions into the general realm,&nbsp;let’s assume that we’re given two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, such that as $x \to \infty$, $f$ converges to one of the infinities and $g$ converges to some real number $G$. The question is, what can we extrapolate about the <strong>convergence behavior</strong> of $f+g$ — if any?</p><p>Here, to figure this&nbsp;out, we begin by noticing that since $g$ converges to an <em>actual</em> number $G$, by …</p></div></div>

<h3>How Can a SaaS Company Stand Out in a Saturated Market?</h3>
<p>There is only one way your SaaS company can stand out successfully in this fiercely competitive environment. You have to develop a shrewd marketing strategy and implement it using the latest tools and techniques, all tailored to your unique business, products, prospects, and customers. This means understanding the powerful impact of <a href="https://www.clearpivot.com/inbound" rel="noopener" target="_blank">inbound marketing</a> for SaaS and making sure everyone in your organization is on board, from marketing to sales, C-suite, product development, and customer success.</p>
<p>The simplest way to understand Inbound is the concept of the flywheel. Rather than the traditional sales funnel that starts with leads and ends with sales, the flywheel starts by attracting and educating leads with strategic content and takes them through from the Attract stage into Engage, Close, and Delight. The reason it is a wheel shape rather than a traditional funnel is because delighted customers will naturally draw in more leads through word of mouth and reviews, which will start the wheel process all over with your next cohort of prospects. These 4 stages are all essential pieces of the <a href="https://www.clearpivot.com/inbound" rel="noopener" target="_blank">inbound flywheel</a><u>,</u> with Attract and Engage primarily under the purview of marketing, Close primarily a sales phase, and Delight as a focus for your service team.</p>
<p>We approach SaaS marketing with a keen eye toward the holistic inbound flywheel, because all of the parts connect to attract, qualify, sell, and keep your subscribers.</p>
<h3>Start with a Smart Strategy &amp; Draw in Leads with Inbound Marketing</h3>
<p>Your product is at the center of this entire conversation. It’s useful, fun, profitable, or unforgettable. Essentially, your product has propelled you this far, and it is good enough to have attracted some users and created some traction for you. But in order to supercharge your sales efforts, you need a steady stream of good-fit leads. And, that’s where inbound marketing comes into play. You need a well-crafted marketing strategy that makes the most of every dollar you spend to reach the right prospects, build trust in your company and specific products, and clearly set you apart from competitors. Then you need an implementation plan that uses the right tools to send the right messages at the right time to attract attention and keep potential customers focused on you as they make their buying decisions.</p>
<p>To help you pull it all together, we’ve created this comprehensive SaaS Marketing Guide. It covers everything you need to know to build a strong, successful digital marketing strategy that pulls in traffic and vets leads for you, so your sales team can focus on growth goals.</p>

<h4>Attract</h4>
<p>The first part of the SaaS marketing flywheel is Attract. In this piece, your goals will relate to getting brand new leads into your database. While each company will need its own specific strategy and KPIs, a few of the <a href="https://www.clearpivot.com/blog/saas-marketing-metrics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most important SaaS marketing metrics</a> to track are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website Visits</li>
<li>Bounce Rate</li>
<li>Visitor to Lead Conversion Rate</li>
</ul>
<h4>Engage</h4>
<p>Once you’ve attracted a potential customer and converted them on something small, like a content offer, your next step is to further engage that lead as a way to qualify, sort and segment them in your database, and prime them for a sale if they’re a great fit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversion Rates and Details on Your Content Offers</li>
<li>Landing Page Interactions</li>
<li>Email Engagement (like open rate and click-through rate)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Close</h4>
<p>Your sales team typically oversees the Close phase of your holistic inbound program, and, along with marketing leadership, pays close attention to metrics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</li>
<li>Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this particular resource is focused on SaaS Marketing, so we don’t go in-depth on SaaS sales here, but everything marketing does is meant to support sales and company growth, so it’s important to remember just how intertwined the process of inbound can be.</p>
<h4>Delight</h4>
<p>The last stage in the inbound flywheel is to make your customers feel so included and happy they can’t help but share everything they love about your company and solution. Typically overseen by your Service team, this part of the flywheel helps you strive for improvements in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscription Upgrades</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Survey Results</li>
<li>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Further down in this guide we go into a ton of detail of every level of this flywheel concept, specifically related to SaaS marketing. But before we get there, let's continue our exploration of the basic foundations for great SaaS marketing. Up next is more about your brand, tech stack and website.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Your Brand: What Impression Are You Making?</h3>
<p>We don’t have to tell you how important branding is, but when’s the last time you evaluated the impact of your brand on your business goals? Does your original brand still resonate with your target audience? Is it time to refresh your look, the tone of your writing, or bring in something new to stay relevant? Especially in the world of cloud-based technology and software solutions, your brand is crucial. It’s what differentiates your company from everyone else, and allows for a foothold for your audience to get on board. Let’s get real about your SaaS branding efforts.</p>
<h4>Brand Messaging for SaaS</h4>
<p>In the context of software, where there is not necessarily a physical product or place, your brand is even more crucial than in other businesses. Building a SaaS brand is a unique experience, where personality, design, and messaging come together to guide your customers into believing in your solution. Before your leads ever get into the sales process, your brand helps them to build confidence in your company’s knowledge, honesty, and helpfulness.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re not creating your SaaS brand in a vacuum. You’re creating it for <em>people. </em>Smart marketers create buyer personas: generalized representations that humanize each key segment of your target audience. Though they exist only on paper, personas embody typical traits of each prospective customer group: age, gender, income, job function, chief pain points and desires. They serve as “advisors” as you create your marketing tactics and messaging so you can speak to prospects as if you are having an in-person conversation.</p>
<h4>How to Use Storytelling to Connect with Real People</h4>
<p>Building brand affinity starts with storytelling. Tell stories about how, exactly, your customers are using your SaaS product. Focus on the feeling it gives them, the accomplishments it helps them to achieve, or the bottom-line impact. Try sharing more about how your solution was created, and why. It’s not just about the brand promise of what your solution can do. It’s also about telling the human stories behind it to build trust and convey your core values.</p>
<p>Share the story of your founders, how they met, and what sparked the idea for your innovative solution. Tell your customer stories, sharing their unique applications of your products, …</p></div></span></p></div></div></div>

Over the course of thirty years, its economy grew almost tenfold. And while extremists always enjoyed a loud say in Poland’s raucous public sphere, the government changed hands through free and fair elections on multiple occasions. By the early 2010s, political scientists were convinced that the country’s democratic system had become “consolidated.”</p><p>But with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that Poland’s status as a consolidated democracy was a naïve illusion. The country’s divisions were more dangerous, and the population’s attachment to the values of liberal democracy more tenuous, than scholars realized. And so Poland has, since the election of a populist government under the leadership of Jarosław Kaczyński five short years ago, gone from the most prominent case study of the benefits of liberal democracy to the most important exemplar of its perennial brittleness.</p><p>Sadly, the outcome of yesterday’s elections raises the threat to Polish democracy to an even higher level. After a nasty and bigoted campaign, Andrzej Duda managed to win reelection as the country’s president by the narrowest of margins. This leaves the <em>Law and Justice</em> party, which already enjoyed a parliamentary majority, free to continue its attacks on the media and the independence of the judiciary. With legislative elections that might put a real check on the government’s power over three years away, Kaczyński and his allies are likely to succeed in destroying Polish democracy.</p><p><strong>The Playbook of the Elected Autocrat</strong></p><p>The Polish government stands for many things I abhor. In the last weeks of the campaign, Duda warned that homosexuals were seeking to corrupt Poland’s children, and claimed that his opponent would do the bidding of Jews out to take revenge on the Polish nation.</p><p>But what the shameful propagandists of Viktor Orbán’s Hungary and Jarosław Kaczyński’s Poland—who sadly include many supposedly serious American conservatives, from Patrick Deneen to Michael Brendan Dougherty—miss is that this is not what makes the government antidemocratic.</p><p>In a liberal democracy, we have to tolerate profound disagreements over values, even when we are firmly convinced that our adversaries are bigots. But what we cannot tolerate is attacks on the institutions that are supposed to ensure a fair chance of displacing the government when the next elections roll around.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/905962/viktor-orbns-american-apologists">the willful blindness</a> of people like Deneen and Dougherty, this is precisely the principle that Poland’s government has systematically broken. As the Rutgers political scientist R. Daniel Kelemen has pointed out, elected autocrats tend to follow six steps: win elections; capture referees, such as courts and other independent bodies; attack or seize control of the media; demonize and undermine the opposition; change the rules of the game; and win new elections that are no longer free.</p><p>Even before yesterday’s vote, the Polish government was well on its way towards accomplishing these goals. When Law and Justice swept to power, the party promised cultural restraint and economic largesse. But while it did pass a popular child benefit scheme, it also set about polarizing society and punishing adversaries.</p><p>The first order of business was a large-scale attack on the independence of the judiciary. As soon as it was in control, Law and Justice curbed the power of the Constitutional Tribunal; changed the composition of the Supreme Court, filling it with partisan loyalists; abolished the independence of the body that nominates lower-court judges; founded a parallel court system to oversee elections; and forbade judges from criticizing government policy. According to the latest country report by Freedom House, the country’s judiciary is no longer independent. </p><p>The second order of business was an equally effective attack on the country’s public broadcaster, Telewizja Polska (TVP). Like the BBC in the United Kingdom, the network is meant to strive for political neutrality. Instead, the Law and Justice government transformed an admittedly flawed institution into a shameless outlet for racist and homophobic propaganda that makes Fox News look like the <em>New York Review of Books</em>. </p><p>Its control over public television has allowed Law and Justice to demonize the opposition with abandon. Over the last weeks of the campaign, TVP variously accused Duda’s challenger, Rafał Trzaskowski, of planning to sell Poland out to Jews, Germans, or the LGBTQ lobby. As the supposedly neutral presenter of a primetime news show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/25/polish-populism-evening-news-public-broadcaster-presidential-election">intoned a few weeks before the first round of the elections</a>: “Experts have no doubt [that] the stream of money that currently flows from the state budget into the pockets of Polish families will dry up if Trzaskowski, after his possible victory in the presidential election, will seek to satisfy Jewish demands.”</p><p>Now that the government’s power is secured for another three years, the fear that the government will further undermine free speech and independent institutions is not a hostile assumption: it is a promise the government itself repeatedly made over the course of the campaign. The most immediate step will likely be to capture those remaining newspapers and television channels that are free to criticize the government. Since many of them are owed by companies based outside the country, the government has vowed to “re-Polonize the media.”</p><p>In the final step towards authoritarianism, <a href="https://twitter.com/rdanielkelemen/status/1282673577964249089">Kelemen warns</a>, the government is likely to start attacking the integrity of the electoral system itself. The opportunities to do so are many: Law and Justice could try to get the electoral commission under tight control, make it harder for Poles who live abroad to participate in democratic elections, and take away powers from big city mayors, who tend to belong to the opposition party.</p><p>In <em>The People vs Democracy</em>, I warned that opponents of populism usually have only one chance to vote aspiring autocrats out of office. In their first four or five years in power, populist governments tend to skew the playing field in a dangerous way, but don’t usually succeed in completely capturing independent institutions such as electoral commissions. If they have another four or five years at their disposal, the takeover of the political system becomes complete.</p><p>I fear that this is the fate that will now befall Poland. Yesterday’s elections, though no longer fair, were largely free. There is no guarantee that this will still be true when Law and Justice next has to face the electorate.</p><p><strong>Poland’s Lesson for Other Countries Ruled By Populists</strong></p><p>Scholars are always tempted to believe that events that contemporaries failed to predict had nevertheless been predestined to happen all along. Nobody saw the French Revolution coming, for example, and yet successive generations of historians have triumphantly identified its deep and incontrovertible causes. (Needless to say, each successive generation of historians has identified <em>different</em> deep and incontrovertible causes.)</p><p>But the truth is that history is full of critical junctures in which countries and societies are set on divergent paths because of small, contingent factors. The election in Poland was one of these junctures. With the country deeply divided between west and east, young and old, urban and rural, Duda’s margin of victory was extremely close. A slightly different set of campaign tactics, a heavy storm over the country’s eastern part, or simply a more independent media could very well have made a decisive difference to the outcome.</p><p>These events did not materialize, however, and so Poland has now set out on the path towards dictatorship. Over the next three years, demographic changes are likely to favor the opposition. But by the time the precarious balance of public opinion shifts against the government, the vote is no longer likely to be either free or fair.</p><p>Circumstance has conspired against Polish democracy. Whether the structural factors that favor the opponents of authoritarian populism can overcome the tremendous power now enjoyed by the government is, at best, an open question. Anyone who is doubtful about the urgency of voting out authoritarian populists in other countries—from Brazil to the United States—before they can consolidate their hold on power would do very well to take heed.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The Rust compiler has a few assumptions that it makes about the behavior of all code.
Violations of those assumptions are referred to as <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#undefined-behavior">Undefined Behavior</a>.
Since Rust is a safe-by-default language, programmers usually do not have to worry about those rules (the compiler and libraries ensure that safe code always satisfies the assumptions),
but authors of <code>unsafe</code> code are themselves responsible for upholding these requirements.</p>

<p>Those assumptions are <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html">listed in the Rust reference</a>.
The one that seems to be most surprising to many people is the clause which says that Rust code may not <em>produce</em> “[…] an invalid value, even in private fields and locals”.
The reference goes on to explain that “<em>producing</em> a value happens any time a value is assigned to or read from a place, passed to a function/primitive operation or returned from a function/primitive operation”.
In other words, even just <em>constructing</em>, for example, an invalid <code>bool</code>, is Undefined Behavior—no matter whether that <code>bool</code> is ever actually “used” by the program.
The purpose of this post is to explain why that rule is so strict.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<p>First of all, let me clarify what is meant by “used” here, as that term is used to mean very different things.
The following code “uses” <code>b</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>b</span> <span>{</span> <span>42</span> <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>23</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I hope it is not very surprising that calling <code>example</code> on, e.g., <code>3</code> transmuted to <code>bool</code> is Undefined Behavior (UB).
When compiling <code>if</code>, the compiler assumes that <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are the only possible values; there is no saying what could go wrong when that assumption is violated.
(This is a compiler-understood <em>validity invariant</em> that is fixed in the language specification, which is very different from a user-defined <em>safety invariant</em>.
See <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/08/22/two-kinds-of-invariants.html">this earlier post</a> for more details on that distinction.)</p>

<p>What is less obvious is why calling <code>example</code> on <code>3</code> is UB even when there is no such <code>if</code> being executed.
To understand why that is important, let us consider the following example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>acc</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>num</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>acc</span> <span>+=</span> <span>if</span> <span>b</span> <span>{</span> <span>42</span> <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>23</span> <span>};</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>acc</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now assume we were working in a slightly different version of Rust, where transmuting <code>3</code> to a <code>bool</code> is fine as long as you do not “use” the <code>bool</code>.
That would mean that calling <code>example(transmute(3u8), 0)</code> is actually allowed, because in that case the loop never gets executed, so we never “use” <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>However, this is a problem for a very important transformation called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-invariant_code_motion">loop-invariant code motion</a>.
That transformation can be used to turn our <code>example</code> function into the following:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>acc</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>incr</span> <span>=</span> <span>if</span> <span>b</span> <span>{</span> <span>42</span> <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>23</span> <span>};</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>num</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>acc</span> <span>+=</span> <span>incr</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>acc</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The increment <code>if b { 42 } else { 23 }</code>, now called <code>incr</code>, is “invariant” during the execution of the loop, and thus computing the increment can be moved out.
Why is this a good transformation?
Instead of determining the increment each time around the loop, we do that just once, thus saving a lot of conditional jumps that the CPU is unhappy about.
This also enables further transformations down the road, e.g. the compiler could notice that this is just <code>num*incr</code>.</p>

<p>However, in our hypothetical Rust where “unused” values may be invalid, this important optimization is actually incorrect!
To see why, consider again calling <code>example(transmute(3u8), 0)</code>.
Before the optimization, that call was fine.
After the optimization, that call is UB because we are doing <code>if b</code> where <code>b</code> is <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>This is because loop-invariant code motion makes dead code live when the loop is not actually executed.
(We can think of this as a form of “speculative execution”, though entirely unrelated to CPU-level speculative execution.)
To fix the optimization, we could require the compiler to prove that the loop runs at least once (i.e., we could avoid speculative execution), but in general that will be hard (and in <code>example</code> it is impossible, since <code>num</code> can indeed be <code>0</code>).
Another option is to restructure the code to only compute <code>incr</code> if <code>num &gt; 0</code>, but again this can be hard to do in general.
So the alternative that Rust uses is to require that even “unused” data satisfies some basic validity.
That makes <code>example(transmute(3u8), 0)</code> UB in <em>both</em> versions of <code>example</code>, and as such the optimization is correct for this input (and indeed for all possible inputs).</p>

<p>Now, one might argue that <code>b</code> in the example here was not truly “unused”, it was just “used in dead code”.
So instead of saying that <code>b</code> must be <em>always</em> valid, we could somehow try to make the use of <code>b</code> in dead code affect whether or not the program is UB.
However, that is a huge can of worms.
Right now, we have the fundamental principle that <em>dead code cannot affect program behavior</em>.
This principle is crucial for tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/">Miri</a>: since Miri is an interpreter, it never even sees dead code.
I would argue that being able to have tools like Miri is hugely important, and it is worth having a semantics that enables such tools to exist.
But this means our hands are pretty much tied: since we cannot take into account of <code>b</code> is “used in dead code”, we simply have to require <code>b</code> to always be valid, no matter whether and where it is “used” or not.
To support inlining and outlining, we also do not want the function boundary to be relevant, which ultimately leads us to the rule that Rust requires today: whenever data of a given type is <em>produced</em> anywhere, the data needs to be valid for that type.</p>

<p>I hope this post was helpful in explaining why Undefined Behavior in Rust is defined the way it is.
As usual, if you have any comments or questions, let me know in the <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/why-even-unused-data-needs-to-be-valid/12734">forums</a>.</p>

Maybe I can improve the %rerun magic function?</p> <h2 id="whats-wrong-with-the-rerun-function">What’s wrong with the <code>%rerun</code> function?</h2> <p>You can use <code>%rerun</code> to run commands from this or previous sessions of IPython. The most common use case for me is to get my IPython session to the same state when I left it last time. It usually happens when I close it because I think I’m done, and then I realize that I actually want to check one more thing <strong>with all the previous data that I had</strong>. Well, in standard Python REPL, to rerun all the previous commands, I would have to press “arrow up” + “enter” a lot. With IPython, I can just run this one command: <code>%rerun ~1/</code>, and it will execute all the commands from the previous session:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]:</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>But, there is one problem. If one of the past commands throws an exception, IPython will stop. It executes all the commands up to the exception, fails on the exception, and that’s it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]:</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>So if I want to execute the code after the exception, I have to figure out which command fails and rerun all commands after that line. For example, I can call: <code>%rerun ~1/5-66</code>, and this will run all commands from 5th until 66th command.</p> <p>This has some limitations. First of all, you need to say which commands you want to run explicitly. And for that, you need to know the total number of commands for a given session. It’s no longer as convenient as just writing <code>%rerun ~1/</code> and letting IPython figure out the rest.</p> <p>Second of all - I don’t know about you, but I have plenty of exceptions in my IPython sessions. After all, that’s why IPython is for - experimenting with the code to find out what works and then copying that. So for each of the failed commands, I would have to exclude this line from the <code>%rerun</code>. This can quickly turn into a monstrosity like this: <code>%rerun ~1/1-2 ~1/4-6 ~1/8-12 ~1/15-23 ...</code></p> <p>It would be much better to temporarily ignore all the exceptions.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Let’s write an extension that does that!”</em> - I thought. <em>“It probably won’t take longer than 5 minutes to explain everything, so it’s a perfect material for a lightning talk”.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>It took longer than 5 minutes. Much longer. But it was an exciting journey!</p> <h2 id="is-there-a-plugin-for-that">Is there a plugin for that?</h2> <p>The first step was to check if someone already asked about this feature in the past. “Ignore exceptions” setting would be useful, so clearly someone must have thought about that before me.</p> <p>And someone did - already in 2012: <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/1977">Add an ‘ignore exceptions’ mode to run commands in notebook</a>. Starting from version 5.1, you can tag a cell in IPython notebooks with “raises-exception” to indicate that an exception is expected. IPython will ignore it and continue the execution. Unfortunately, it works only for the notebooks (so Jupyter Notebook), not for IPython REPL.</p> <h2 id="fine-i-will-do-it-myself"><em>“Fine, I will do it myself.”</em></h2> <p>Let’s look inside the <code>%rerun</code> function and see how it works:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span># IPython/core/magics/history.py

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Basically, it reuses the <code>%history</code> magic command to grab a list of commands from history and executes them.</p> <p>I could monkey-patch this function and check if a given command is successful before adding it to the <code>hist</code> list. But monkey-patching external libraries is a bad idea. I would have to fork IPython and take care of upgrading it, or I would be stuck on the current version. So I needed a better way.</p> <p>My first idea was to use one of <a href="https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/callbacks.html">IPython’s events</a>. You can register a callback function when a specific event happens, for example, before or after you run a cell. When this event happens, IPython calls your callback function. That looked like a perfect solution! I could check if a given cell throws an exception and, if it does, skip it.</p> <h2 id="writing-a-callback-for-ipython-events">Writing a callback for IPython events</h2> <p>To register my custom callback, I needed to create an IPython extension (I wrote an article explaining <a href="https://switowski.com/blog/ipython-extensions-guide">how extensions work and how to create one</a>):</p> <div><div><pre><code><span># ~/.ipython/extensions/ignore_exceptions.py
</span>
<span>def</span> <span>clean_input</span><span>(</span><span>info</span><span>):</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>exec</span><span>(</span><span>info</span><span>.</span><span>raw_cell</span><span>)</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
        <span>info</span><span>.</span><span>raw_cell</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>

<span>def</span> <span>load_ipython_extension</span><span>(</span><span>ipython</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ipython</span><span>.</span><span>events</span><span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>'pre_run_cell'</span><span>,</span> <span>clean_input</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>load_ipython_extension</code> registers <code>clean_input</code> callback that will be run before executing every cell. And <code>clean_input</code> does the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Takes an argument (<code>info</code>) containing various information about the cell we are about to run. This parameter is mandatory, and IPython will complain if we forget it.</li> <li>Extracts the content of the cell (<code>raw_cell</code>).</li> <li>Tries to run it.</li> <li>And if it raises an exception, replaces that cell with an empty string.</li> </ul> <p>We save that file in the <code>~/.ipython/extensions/ignore_exceptions.py</code> directory and enable our extension with:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>%</span><span>load_ext</span> <span>ignore_exceptions</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>If we try it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]:</span> <span>%</span><span>load_ext</span> <span>ignore_exceptions</span>

<span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]:</span> <span>1</span><span>/</span><span>0</span>
<span>ZeroDivisionError</span>
<span>----&gt;</span> <span>1</span> <span>1</span><span>/</span><span>0</span>

<span>ZeroDivisionError</span><span>:</span> <span>division</span> <span>by</span> <span>zero</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>…it doesn’t really work. There are multiple problems with this code:</p> <ol> <li>First of all - we are using <code>exec</code>, which is not the best practice. But since the code we want to run is the same code we wrote before, I’m fine with that.</li> <li>The <code>info</code> parameter can contain multiple commands. If we call <code>%rerun 1-10</code>, <code>info</code> will contain the first ten commands from the current session. If the exception happens, let’s say in the 5th command, our current implementation will ignore all the commands. But we want to ignore only that 5th one and still execute the other nine commands. So that’s not going to work.</li> <li>And even if we didn’t have all those problems, <strong>overwriting the <code>info.raw_cell</code> doesn’t actually change the code that will be executed</strong>.</li> </ol> <p>We need something better.</p> <h2 id="input-transformation">Input transformation</h2> <p>If we want to modify the input cells before they get executed, there is a feature exactly for that called <a href="https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/inputtransforms.html">“input transformation”</a>. You write a function that takes the input, modifies it, and returns it. And you can register your input transformation as an extension, exactly as we did before.</p> <div> <p> There are two types of input transformers: </p><ul> <li><code>input_transformers_cleanup</code> - they run first. At this point, the cell is not guaranteed to contain valid Python code (e.g., IPython-specific syntax, like the magic functions).</li> <li><code>input_transformers_post</code> - they run last, and here the cell contains only the Python code. In most cases, you want to use this one.</li> </ul>  </div> <p>Input transformation solves all our problems (except for using the <code>exec</code>, but I will stick with it for simplicity). First of all, it’s an <em>“input”</em> transformation, so we can use it to change the input cell’s content. And since each line of the input is a separate element in a list, we can just execute them one by one and discard those that raise an exception. So this is what we are going to do:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>clean_input</span><span>(</span><span>lines</span><span>):</span>
    <span>new_lines</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

        <span>try</span><span>:</span>
            <span>exec</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>)</span>
            <span>new_lines</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>)</span>
        <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
            <span>pass</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>new_lines</span>

<span>def</span> <span>load_ipython_extension</span><span>(</span><span>ipython</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ipython</span><span>.</span><span>input_transformers_post</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>clean_input</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let’s load it and run it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]:</span> <span>%</span><span>load_ext</span> <span>ignore_exceptions</span>

<span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]:</span> <span>1</span><span>/</span><span>0</span>

<span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>]:</span> <span>my_number</span> <span>+</span> <span>5</span>
<span># Nothing is returned!
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>It’s working, but partially. If we assign a variable (<code>In [4]</code>) and then reference it (<code>In [5]</code>), you will notice that nothing is returned! That’s because <code>my_number</code> variable was saved in the <strong>local namespace</strong> of IPython, and the <code>exec</code> function call is running without access to those variables. Our extension tries to reference variable <code>my_number</code>, gets a <code>NameError</code>, and since our code is supposed to ignore errors, it ignores that line. Thus - nothing is printed!</p> <p>We need to tell <code>exec</code> about all the variables that have been defined so far. If you check the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#exec">signature of the exec() function</a>, you will see that apart from the code to execute, we can also pass global and local variables. Bingo! Let’s grab the <code>user_ns</code> from the <code>ipython</code> object and pass it …</p></article></div>

  <p><span>Jul 15, 2020</span></p><p>Picture this: you’ve stumbled across the vulnerability of the year. You figured out how to gain access to any verified Twitter user’s account: Joe Biden, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, XXXTentacion, Apple, you name it. That was step 1 of your evil plan. What should step 2 be?</p>

<p>Maybe you log into the president’s account and post a fake tweet about launching missiles to North Korea. I’m not convinced that you can start a world war just by sending out a few fake tweets, but for the sake of argument let’s say that you can. But you’re not interested in watching the world burn anyway; no, your goal is to <strong>make as much money as possible</strong>. What should you do?</p>

<p>The people who carried out today’s Twitter hack had one answer: post variants of the message “send 1 BTC to this address and I’ll send 2 BTC back”  on famous accounts, and then (here’s the kicker) <em>don’t actually send 2 BTC back</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://video-images.vice.com/test-uploads/_uncategorized/1594848885006-image.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>They managed to run off with a little over <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh?page=2">$100,000</a> before Twitter got the situation under control. Several people (on Twitter, on Hacker News, everywhere really) scoffed at this and claimed that they would have done something much more interesting with this kind of power. Let’s explore some of their ideas to see if we really can do better.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="stock-market-manipulation">Stock Market Manipulation</h2>

<p>This is the first thing that comes to most people’s minds. It sounds easy: buy a bunch of Tesla stock, log into Elon Musk’s account, tweet “Taking $TSLA private at $2000,” and sell in the time between the rise in price and when Musk/Twitter/the whole world realizes the hack.</p>

<p>This requires a fair amount of capital to buy the underlying stock, which the hacker may not have had, but there are other options: maybe you short the stock and then tweet (fake) damaging information about Tesla’s new line of cars. Maybe you just short Twitter’s own stock, which will surely take a huge hit in the market tomorrow (the hack was executed after trading hours).</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">oh lol i'd buy HTZ, that's the trade. "i've decided that Tesla will buy Hertz out of bankruptcy at $69 per share and make its fleet entirely self-driving," i'd be a billionaire and Money Stuff would end on the highest possible note</p>— Matt Levine (@matt_levine) <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/1283503080978489344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>The big issue with all of these is that it’s very difficult to participate in the stock market anonymously. The SEC has all sorts of monitoring in place to catch more common forms of insider trading and fraud and you can guarantee that they would conduct a long, thorough investigation into a hypothetical hack-based market fraud. Unlike Bitcoin transactions, wire transfers and stock purchases can be reversed after the fact, and the exposure and risk go way up when you’re actually working with US dollars.</p>

<h2 id="blackmail">Blackmail</h2>

<p>The hackers got <em>full access</em> to all Twitter-verified accounts, meaning that they should have had access to their direct messages. Surely this is much more valuable than just posting a fake tweet? Think about the incalculable damage caused by the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/the-untold-story-of-the-sony-hack">Sony leaks</a> or watch this hypothetical-but-still-terrifying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4GB_NDU43Q">Tom Scott video</a> about a world in which Gmail password-checking was turned off for a day.</p>

<p>It’s definitely true that there are gobs of interesting material lurking in verified users’s DMs that they wouldn’t want seeing the light of day, but it’s a little tricky to make money from this. The most obvious method is blackmail. Exfiltrate the messages from the most popular users and threaten that you’ll release them in full if they don’t send X BTC to Y address.</p>

<p>This would definitely make some amount of money, but I’m not convinced it’s worth the effort. Firstly, it’s hard to judge ahead of time which accounts have the juicy DMs. Large, high-profile accounts like Joe Biden’s are run by a whole social media team and probably don’t exchange sensitive information via Twitter. Smaller accounts probably do have more interesting gossip, but might be less willing or able to pay as a result.</p>

<p>Then there’s the problem of actually exfiltrating and storing all the data, sending individual messages to each of the users you hack, tracking who has and hasn’t paid, and actually releasing the leaked material publicly. It’s a lot of operational overhead that may, in the end, net you less money than the dumb Bitcoin scam.</p>

<h2 id="sell-it-on-the-dark-web">Sell it on the dark web</h2>

<p>Leave aside the challenge of actually finding a buyer (you can’t just make a post on a forum, the Feds read the dark web too). How much should a buyer be willing to pay you for this bug? Either the buyer is planning to monetize the exploit for more than $100k (the whole point of this post is to prove that that’s really hard!), or the buyer wants to use the exploit for other purposes, like surveillance or intelligence gathering.</p>

<p>This isn’t out of the question. Countries spy on each other all the time, and I’m sure that China would love to be able to read the DMs of journalists or Hong Kong activists. The issue is that this particular exploit wasn’t terribly suited to the business of long-term surveillance. Logging into the account required actually the email associated with it and triggering a password reset (that somehow also bypassed 2FA). The password reset triggered a notification email to the original address on file, which basically announced the account takeover. The hacker had a matter of hours before the whole world knew about the vulnerability.</p>

<p>Intelligence agencies want <em>persistent</em> access, and they want to surveil without their targets learning that they were surveilled. This exploit wouldn’t have accomplished that.</p>

<h2 id="bug-bounty">Bug Bounty</h2>

<p>Now we’re getting somewhere… Large companies <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/05/31/hacker-finds-huge-apple-security-hole-apple-pays-100000-bug-bounty/#576388b36894">routinely</a> pay out vast sums of money to white hat hackers reporting flaws that are less damaging than this one. Even if Twitter wouldn’t pay out 100% as much money as was made via the Bitcoin scam, bug bounty programs have the added benefit of being 100% legal, which should change the risk calculus significantly. So why didn’t our hacker take this route?</p>

<p>One theory is that if the hacker was already a known criminal, it’s tricky to collect the bug bounty payout without revealing their identity to Twitter, which might still end them up in some trouble. I’m not sure I buy this (can’t they just use a third party?).</p>

<p>More plausibly, perhaps Twitter wouldn’t actually have paid out $100k?</p>

<blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr">🤔 <a href="https://t.co/I902KoaZwe">pic.twitter.com/I902KoaZwe</a></p>— LiveOverflow 🔴 (@LiveOverflow) <a href="https://twitter.com/LiveOverflow/status/1283511782380908545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>This tweet suggests that OAuth takeovers were valued at $7.7k (and after taxes you’re left with chump change). If so, this a big issue with Twitter’s bug bounty program! You need to ensure that the incentives make reporting more worth it than exploiting.</p>

<p><em>Update: more reporting about how the account takeovers were executed <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxd3d/twitter-insider-access-panel-account-hacks-biden-uber-bezos">has emerged</a>, and it suggests that there wasn’t any technical vulnerability that was ever exploited. Social engineering and insider risk (which can obviously be quite damaging) tend not to be eligible for bounties on most programs.</em></p>

<h2 id="phishing">Phishing</h2>

<p>OK how about this: log into Coinbase’s twitter account, craft a tweet announcing some snazzy new feature and include a bit.ly link that actually goes to a phishing website. Execute a <a href="https://fortenf.org/e/2018/05/29/coinbase-phishing.html">relay phishing attack</a> that gives you access to their Coinbase account while bypassing 2FA, and then send all their Bitcoin and Ethereum and Dogecoin to your own account.</p>

<p>There are a few flaws, but most are surmountable with some effort. First, Twitter would probably take down the tweet pretty fast, so you’d probably want to target several different accounts of famous cryptocurrency enthusiasts (not just Coinbase). Second, bit.ly would probably disable that specific URL and Google would definitely add the phishing site to their <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a> list (which is shared by all major browsers). This would result in big scary red warning banners appearing before users could access your site. Also, whatever registrar you purchased your domain from would probably revoke it.</p>

<p>OK, so instead of having one phishing site and one domain and one URL you’d want to set up several of these in advance and hop from one to the other as each gets taken down by various actors in turn. This would probably work! Would it net you more than $100k? Maybe?! It’s hard to say and probably depends a lot on luck and timing. The people with the most cryptocurrency in their Coinbase accounts are probably the least likely to fall for this kind of thing in the first place, so it’s unclear how much more money you’d make than the dumb 2-for-1 scam, but still, it might be worth it in case you manage to compromise an account with huge reserves.</p>

<p>Still, all this requires some legitimately difficult software engineering work and the whole point of this was to make easy money! I understand that today’s attack was almost painfully lame in its execution, but it really may have been the smartest choice tactically.</p>

<p>This is not to say that they did everything right: I still can’t explain why they seem to have used only 1 BTC address throughout the process (Coinbase and other exchanges quickly blocked transactions to this address), and the wording on some of their tweets was stilted and awkward (surely they could have paid for a Grammarly subscription). But in the end, I think there’s no evidence that the twitter posts were just a “cover” for the real attack or that this hack had anything to do with a foreign government. I think this tweet sums it up well:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">High impact bugs can sometimes be found and exploited by anyone, even dogs who have no idea what to do with the car they caught. There really doesn't have to be more to it than that.</p>— Brad Hill (@hillbrad) <a href="https://twitter.com/hillbrad/status/1283597241685438464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amid a race against time for the creation of the coronavirus vaccine, Great Britain, Canada and the United States announced on Thursday that they have discovered attempts by Russia to get into computer systems and get their hands on their research in this regard.</p><p>This attack targeted three countries, namely Great Britain, Canada and the United States. “Throughout 2020, APT29 targeted various organizations involved in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, most likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property related to development and testing,” <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine-development.pdf">London reports</a>.</p><p>The report concludes that “In recent attacks targeting COVID-19 vaccine research and development, the group conducted basic vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses owned by the organisations. The group then deployed public exploits against the vulnerable services identified. The group has been successful using recently published exploits to gain initial footholds.”</p><h2>Who is behind APT29?</h2><p>The United States National Security Agency (NSA) said it approved the British communiqué. APT29 is considered a cyber intelligence unit of the GRU, the Russian General Staff intelligence agency. GRU uses this unit to destabilize its opponents, involving it both in wars, as was the case in Ukraine, and in elections, as was the case in the United States in 2016. ”</p><p>Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organisations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p>APT29 is using custom malware known as ‘WellMess’ and ‘WellMail’ to target a number of organisations globally. This includes those organisations involved with COVID-19 vaccine development. WellMess and WellMail have not previously been publicly associated to APT29.</p><p>It is completely unacceptable for Russian intelligence to target those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic,” <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/unacceptable-that-russian-intel-targets-covid-19-work-uks-raab-says">British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said</a>.</p><p>“The UK will continue to counter those conducting such cyber attacks, and work with our allies to hold perpetrators to account,” Raab concluded.</p><h2>The race for a COVID-19 Vaccine</h2><p><strong>The great powers are in a race against time to obtain the vaccine against the new coronavirus.</strong> Currently, more than 100 coronavirus vaccines are being developed across the world, with 19 candidates in human trials. However, only two experimental vaccines, one by China’s Sinopharm and another by Oxford/AstraZeneca, are in the final phase 3 trials.</p><p>US company <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53426367">Moderna announced encouraging results for its COVID-19 vaccine</a> on Wednesday and said it would begin the final phase of clinical trials on July 27, which is expected to last for three months.&nbsp; The announcement puts Moderna in the leading platoon in the global race to find a vaccine against COVID-19, international media report.</p><p>Hours after Moderna’s announcement, the <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/health/article/russian-defense-ministry-says-it-has-developed-a-safe-covid-19-vaccine/622187">Russian Defense Ministry issued a statement to brief the world on its progress</a>, claiming that it had already completed the first human clinical trials of a vaccine against the new coronavirus and that they are due to be completed by the end of July.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1580150824743" id="item-5e2f2fe7871a582cf4b69e1e"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-375d27563e5201dac457"><div><p>Almost every week someone contacts us at Permanent Equity asking about how to buy a business.</p><p>We got four such requests last week alone. We try to be <a href="https://www.permanentequity.com/our-pledge">highly responsive and helpful</a>, pointing people to resources, answering questions, and hopping on a call to chat through some nuance when appropriate.</p><p>Because of time constraints and the path of conversation, the inevitable result is that we only shine the light on a tiny sliver of a much bigger picture. Like blind people grabbing different parts of the elephant, someone can walk away with a warped misrepresentation of reality. As an example, if we only discuss deal origination, an unsaid assumption may be that the rest is easy, or straightforward.</p><p>My hope is, unselfishly, this can help people who want to acquire a smaller company and help the families who own those companies. You both need each other. Unfortunately there’s a tremendous amount more sellers than qualified buyers, and the problem is only getting worse as Baby Boomers look to exit simultaneously.</p><p>Selfishly, I hope this is able to scale conversations in a way that I can’t do currently, freeing up my time and relieving me of the guilt I feel when a kind, thoughtful person reaches out for help and I’m already spread too thin.</p><p>Before I get started, I want to provide a loud and clear disclaimer. After a decade of being in this space, I don’t yet consider myself skilled at what I do. If I were to rate my competence level on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being a consummate pro and 1 being an ignorant disaster zone, I’m probably a 3. Each deal we do presents new challenges, setbacks, and valuable lessons. We’re not novices, but yet I find myself apologizing at some point in the process each and every time. Reader beware.</p><h3><strong>THE GATES</strong></h3><p>The path to buying a business involves seven distinct “gates,” or barriers, that must be navigated successfully to produce a meaningfully positive financial outcome: 1) Find, 2) Negotiate, 3) Diligence, 4) Document, 5) Finance, 6) Operate, and 7) Exit. Each gate carries a low probability of success and it’s a multiplicative system, meaning each probability of success must be multiplied by the other probabilities to get the odds of success. Even if each gate carried a 50% likelihood of success, which it doesn’t, your overall success rate would be about 1.5%.</p><p>I don’t say this to unnecessarily scare you, because miracles do happen. We’ve now done seven late-stage deals in 10 years at Permanent Equity. But you need to go into this space with your eyes wide open — It’s brutally hard, and for very good reason.</p><h3><strong>FIND</strong></h3><p>Without opportunities, nothing else matters. The goal is to find deals that meet your criteria and have a higher likelihood of success, and simultaneously not to waste time on things that can’t, or shouldn’t, close. While sheer volume can sound impressive, it’s a vanity metric. I’d rather have fewer, but better deals. This prioritization allows for the focus required to get an opportunity across the finish/starting line.</p><p>Each buyer’s criteria is different based on opportunity costs, skill set, capital base, time horizon, geography, and operational style. If you have $1M of equity to invest, it’s irresponsible to go after a $10M purchase, just as pouring over East Coast companies is a waste if you want to live in Colorado.</p><p>Here are the starting questions you should ask:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>If I don’t buy a company, what else could I do with my time, relationships, and financial resources? This sets your opportunity cost.</p></li><li><p>What useful talents can I bring to bear on an acquisition? This is your incremental upside.</p></li><li><p>What areas of business am I inexperienced or unskilled in? Plan for help, which is usually expensive.</p></li><li><p>What is my size, source, and reliability of capital, and what are that capital source’s expectations? This provides the financial constraints.</p></li><li><p>Where do I want to live and how important is that in my decision-making process?</p></li><li><p>Remember, more constraints mean lower probability.</p></li><li><p>What types of decisions do I intend to make, and who else will make the rest of the decisions?</p></li><li><p>How long do I intend to be involved with the investment?</p></li><li><p>What does a successful “exit” look like?</p></li></ol><p>Once you have a clear picture of the target, you can start finding opportunities. Deals typically follow two paths — intermediated/auctioned or direct. Especially in the beginning, the vast majority of the deals you review will be intermediated, and most of those will be open auctions.</p><p>While you’ll need to participate in auctions to see deals, the best deals never make it to auction. As a friend of mine likes to say, “If you see an oil deal out of Texas, it means I passed on it, twice.” Most quality companies care who they sell to and want to keep the process tight, which means the intermediary is contacting very few people, all of which have a prior relationship.</p><p>You must always ask yourself, “Why am I the lucky person?” If you want to get better deals, you have to form better relationships. The best path to incremental deal flow is to have 1000 phone calls and 300 steak dinners. It’s time-consuming, but I have yet to discover a short cut. You need to follow up with each intermediary and stay top of mind. I recommend setting aside 5-10 hours of your week to make phone calls and send emails to be sure they remember you exist.</p><p>The other option is to go direct, making contact with an owner and developing a relationship. For owners of more profitable businesses, the profile is older and you have to go where they are — trade shows, industry conferences, their service providers, their offices, and their homes. They’re far less likely to be on social media, which makes targeted advertising extremely challenging.</p><p>One challenge is timing, mixed with expectations. Most owners are open to selling if they’d get higher than their “number,” and usually their expectations start in the stratosphere. As with anything, if you haven’t done it before, it’s going to look simple and country club bravado is always about “the multiple.”</p><p>It’s easy to laugh off, but the struggle is real. Put yourself in their shoes: Two of your buddies have “sold out” in the past couple years. One claimed a 6X multiple and the other claimed an 8X multiple. Let’s assume both friends were both being completely truthful and had big, moated businesses. Do you think someone coming along offering less is going to sweep the owner off his feet? Not so much.</p><p>The reality is that multiples, as I’ll go into during the negotiation section, are an approximation for valuation and nothing more. But, people get fixated on it and use it as a proxy for fairness. Like hearing about people’s salary at a bar, multiples get inflated, twisted, and confused in discussion. If someone has unreasonably high expectations, try to give them a little education, then leave them alone. The sharp rocks of reality eventually hit.</p><p>The bottom line is that you need to look at lots of deals before buying your first company. There’s no substitute for practice — yes, I’m talking about practice — and you want to avoid the “fool and his money are invited everywhere” syndrome. I recommend keeping track of your expectations. For every 50 deals you see, write down what you thought was the best one and why. By the time you see your 500th deal, you’ll be shocked at what initially looked attractive.</p><h3><strong>NEGOTIATE</strong></h3><p>To be successful long-term, you need to create a win-win deal and not make the negotiation zero sum. The goal is to get creative in how risk and reward are shared in various scenarios. Price is just one of the tools in your toolbox. Here are a few more:</p><p><strong>Seller Debt:</strong> The seller helps finance a portion of the purchase price. It’s like any other debt, with a size, term, interest rate, security, and covenants. Depending on the situation, you can delay the amortization, or make it a bullet payment. If you don’t know many of these terms, start Googling.</p><p><em>Example: $3M seller note at 5% interest, on a six-year term. The first three years are interest-only, with it fully amortizing thereafter. The loan is recourse to the buyer’s equity interest in the company and subordinate to senior debt, including a working capital line of credit.</em></p><p><strong>Earn-Out:</strong> Payments to the seller are based on performance. Pretty much whatever you can dream up can be done. But a warning: the more complicated, the less likely you’ll get the deal done, and if you do, the more likely you’ll have major conflict with the seller post-close.</p><p><em>Example: There will be a $2M payment after year two and a $3M payment after year five, as long as the company’s gross profit levels remaining at greater than $10M in every year after the transaction. So if in year 4, the gross profits drop below $10M, the final $3M payment isn’t earned.</em></p><p><strong>Executive Compensation: </strong>Most sellers will continue working for the business post-close. You can adjust their compensation and the term of employment up/down as a deal tool.</p><p><em>Example: Seller will get a base salary of $200,000 and customary benefits, plus a bonus of $50,000 based on performance benchmarks. The initial employment contract will be for three years, but the company can buy out the contract at any time for 50% of the remaining salary.</em></p><p><strong>Consulting:</strong> It’s not unusual for a seller to be associated with the business in an advisory capacity for a considerable period of time upon leaving their full-time role. Usually this comes with a smaller amount of compensation.</p><p><em>Example: After full-time employment ends, the seller will become Board Chairman and will be paid $50,000 per year.</em></p><p><strong>Management Fee:</strong> If you’re buying 100% of a company, the management fee is irrelevant. Otherwise, it’s important. Determine how much and what it covers. The more specific, the better.</p><p><em>Example: Buyer will receive a monthly management fee equal to 3% of TTM EBITDA, which covers all oversight and travel expenses. Extraordinary work within the company will be mutually agreed upon and separately compensated.</em></p><p><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Oftentimes, the seller will own the primary piece(s) of real estate. The terms of use can be an …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>It’s 2020 and although DevOps is a practice that’s very commonly adopted today, I feel that a not too overly technical explanation of the subject might be beneficial to those individuals, or companies, that are not using it yet but find themselves in a position where it makes sense to use such model. Moreover, if you’re completely or partially new to this subject, this is a great place to start!</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-this-devops-thing">So what is this DevOps thing?</h2>
<p>DevOps can be defined as a combination between cultural philosophies, practices and tools.</p>
<p>The <strong>cultural philosophy</strong> aspect is about changing how you develop and deploy software. In the DevOps model people who take care of software development and people who take care of operations (by managing, monitoring and operating infrastructure) work very closely together; sometimes the two roles are combined together. The DevOps term originates exactly from here: <strong>Dev</strong>eloper <strong>Op</strong>eration<strong>s</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, there are <strong>practices</strong>. They help you to understand how the DevOps model works, in practice. Don’t worry if you have no idea what these are, more on them in just a moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>Microservices</li>
<li>Infrastructure as Code</li>
<li>Monitoring and Logging</li>
<li>Containerization &amp; Orchestration</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <strong>tools</strong>. These, along with the aforementioned practices, will help you to concretely adopt the DevOps model. Some of the relevant tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git</li>
<li>Jenkins</li>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>Automated testing libraries/frameworks</li>
</ul>
<p>The DevOps model will improve every aspect of the application lifecycle, from development and testing to deployments and production rollouts. The team relies on automation to speed up manual processes and, thanks to the appropriate tools, applications can grow in a rapid and flexible way.</p>
<p><strong>DevOps is first of all a mentality shift</strong>, where you are required to change the way you approach software development and release. While it may be good to have one person to be the leader of this change, you should make sure that your whole team/company is ready to take the leap.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h3>
<p>It is composed by two main elements: a cultural one and a technical/automated one. The cultural part consists in learning how to make frequent integrations. In other words, developers should not wait an excessive amount of time before merging their commits into the rest of the project. The technical/automated part is represented by the tools that helps automating these frequent integrations. Jenkins, for example, is a popular open source tool widely used for this. Continuous Integration solves the problem of heavy integrations and it helps reducing time spent solving merge conflicts. Statistically, the longer you wait to merge the more chances you will incur in a conflict. Merge often to avoid this!</p>
<h3 id="continuous-delivery--deployment">Continuous Delivery / Deployment</h3>
<p>It extends Continous Integration by automating deployments to staging and production environments. These deployments can have pre-requisites such as automated tests; they can even go beyond Unit Tests and require interface tests, load tests, integration tests, API reliability tests and so on. There is a difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment. With C. Delivery you will automatically deploy on a staging environment and manual approval will be required if you want to deploy in production. With C. Deployment you go one step further and also automate production rollouts. You can use Jenkins for this or you can search for more specific tools that will hook into the Continuous Integration offered by Jenkins. This practice will help you reduce human errors and time required to complete the deployment process.</p>
<h3 id="microservices">Microservices</h3>
<p>It is a type of architecture used to build an application or a set of services. The application is based on a smaller set of services that communicates with each other through, for example, HTTP APIs. Each microservice has its own responsibility and the application is broken down into microservices according to the needs of the application domain. Frameworks or programming languages can be used to write microservices and distribute them, either individually or as a group of services. With this approach, our application will have the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>More easily maintainable. You only touch the microservice you need.</li>
<li>More resilient to errors. If a microservice fails, the rest of the microservices can continue to work since they are independent.</li>
<li>Better testable and more modular. You can use different languages and technologies on each microservice, using the most suitable solution on case by case basis without committing to a single technology for the whole project. Each microservice can then be tested with separate approaches and methodologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Microservices have gradually become the standard for building systems that make use of practices such as Continuous Deployment.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure-as-code">Infrastructure as Code</h3>
<p>It consists in managing the cloud infrastructure through software development methodologies, such as version control and continuous integration. The cloud can be setup via API, allowing developers and administrators to interact with the infrastructure in a programmatic way and on a very large scale rather than through manual setting and configuration of resources. Since everything can be managed by code, the infrastructure and servers can be deployed as quickly as possible via standardized templates, updated with patches or duplicated iteratively. There are several tools to implement this: Chef, Puppet, Terraform, Ansible, etc. The advantages are remarkable, in addition to those above we have zero downtime (if applied well) and auto-scaling of resources.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-and-logging">Monitoring and Logging</h3>
<p>Keeping parameters and logs under check is useful to find out how application and infrastructure performance affects the end-user experience. Data and logs generated by applications and infrastructure are acquired; after categorizing and analyzing them, the possible causes of problems or unforeseen changes can be thoroughly examined. Creating alarms or analyzing data in real time also help in proactively monitoring services. One of the tools to implement this practice is Nagios.</p>
<h3 id="containerization--orchestration">Containerization &amp; Orchestration</h3>
<p>These are two techniques used to manage software. Containererization, through tools such as Docker, provides a logical packaging mechanism that allows applications to be abstracted from the underlying environment they run on. Decoupling things like this allows for easy and consistent deployments of container-based applications, whether the target environment is a private data center, the public cloud or a developer’s computer. Compared to virtual machines, containers have several advantages such as reduced disk size and low overhead. Orchestration refers to practices such as automatic deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications and can be achieved using tools such as Kubernetes.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-the-devops-model">What are the advantages of the DevOps model?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speed. Applications developed using a microservice architecture with the addition of continuous integration allows you to release updates more frequently and to better control services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rapid delivery. Practices such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) lead to faster releases and bug fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliability. Thanks to CI/CD and monitoring/logging rest assured that releases will meet quality standards without sacrificing the end-user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scalability. Infrastructure as code allows you to manage development, testing and production environments in an iterative and more efficient way - on any scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An evolution of software architecture, development and delivery that is not the same as it was twenty years ago.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-simple-pipeline-example">A simple pipeline example</h2>
<p>Now that we know about DevOps and its advantages, let’s briefly look at a simple pipeline example. There is no correct or definitive structure: you can modify the pipeline to better adapt it to certain situations or as you see fit. This is just an example.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://garry.bhatt.al/assets/images/2020-07-16/pipeline.png" alt="DevOps pipeline">
</figure>
<p>In the first step you version the code, with a tool like Git. Developers then develop and commit the code to a repository.</p>
<p>The second step is not always necessary, it depends on the language and technology used. It consists of building the project, which often means having a working version of the project locally.</p>
<p>The third step is running unit tests on the project. This can also be automated - useful to prepare for the next step.</p>
<p>The fourth step is deployment to development/staging environments. At this point you can view the code running on an environment that can be shared with the client. This point can also be automated.</p>
<p>Subsequently, other tests can be run on the development environment. Other people responsible for testing the project can come into play by running their test tasks, even manually, on a development environment that should be complete and working. Depending on requirements, this step can also be automated.</p>
<p>If all goes well it’s time to go live! Deployment in production happens. Once this is done there is the operational/monitoring phase. Things such as applications, state of the infrastructure, errors, logs and more are kept under control.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Hopefully by now you have an idea of what DevOps is, at least on paper. DevOps, as I have repeatedly stated, is first and foremost a cultural change that impacts all the figures involved in software development. In fact, it requires a different, more modern approach to software development and distribution; in return, if implemented well, it provides us with several advantages such as the reduction of different problems and timescales. It also prepares us to better face challenges that previously would have been more problematic to manage.</p>
<p>Should you find any mistake, technical or grammatical, please don’t hesitate to let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Metallurgists</strong></p>
<p>I have enjoyed writing many articles about the history of different knife steels over the past couple years of this website. It has been very challenging to track down the history of different steels to see where they came from and how. I decided to write an article about some of the greats who have made contributions to knife steel and knife tests. Many of these metallurgists didn’t know they were developing steels that would be used in knives. Some were developing tool steels or high speed steels. However, their steels have since been used in knives or their steel designs influenced other steels which have been used in knives. To keep this article manageable in size I have focused on those that developed steel or tests of knives. In other words, those that studied different aspects of steel are not included. Some notable people that were omitted for this reason include:</p>
<p>1) Marcus Grossman and Edgar Bain who discovered bainite and wrote a couple influential books on steel metallurgy</p>
<p>2) Many metallurgists who are less directly applicable but discovered many fundamentals of steel and general metallurgy, such as Henry Clifton Sorby (microscopy), Dmitry Chernov (phase transitions in steel), and William Roberts-Austen (iron-carbon phase diagram).</p>
<p>3) Metallurgists who studied heat treatment techniques. Taylor and White in the list below are a possible exception to this, however.</p>
<p>4) Influential teachers of metallurgy, some even directly to knifemakers like Kevin Cashen. Some on this list are also known for their teaching, but make the list primarily for other specific contributions.</p>
<p>So that list of categories may mean that some people you may think of as great metallurgists did not make the list. However, even with those omissions I think you will find some interesting information about the contributions of certain individuals and groups that developed the steel products we use in knives today.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Forester Mushet</strong></p>
<p>Mushet developed the first tool steel in 1868 which had several important characteristics. One was that it was the first commercially produced “alloy steel” meaning it had intentional alloy additions including manganese and tungsten to achieve certain properties, rather than being a simple carbon steel. The high tungsten in the steel gave it very high wear resistance for longer tool life. It was also the first “air hardening” steel meaning it could be allowed to cool in air from high temperature rather than quenching in oil or water. This steel was the basis of experiments from Taylor and White that led to the development of high speed steels and the explosion of development in other tool steels. Mushet is actually better known for making improvements to the “Bessemer process” which allowed the production of steel at much lower costs. But for his contributions to the future of knife steel his “Mushet steel” is huge.

<p>Mushet</p>
<p><strong>Frederick Winslow Taylor and Maunsel White</strong></p>
<p>These Bethlehem Steel metallurgists started modern steel development in many ways. Prior to their contributions, steel was heat treated in a fairly narrow temperature range, such as 1400-1600°F. Overheating would lead to grain growth and poor toughness. However, they discovered that when Mushet steel was heated to very high temperatures prior to quenching, that it could last much longer as a high speed tool, because it maintained high hardness at high speeds and therefore high temperatures. Their discovery of “high speed steel” was presented at the 1900 Paris Exhibition (a world’s fair) and led to a T1-type high speed steel by 1903. The knowledge developed and the excitement generated led to the development of many other tool steels.

<p>White</p>
<p><strong>Harry Brearley</strong></p>
<p>While there were several people working on inventing stainless steel in a similar time period, Brearley is credited with being the first to commercialize it. And what type of stainless steel did he commercialize? A knife steel! For several years afterward, stainless steel was known as being for knives and many people didn’t even realize it could be used for other things. The steel he developed was 420 stainless. This steel may have a relatively poor reputation among knife enthusiasts today, but it has been used in as many knives as any steel, perhaps the most used knife steel. And it has very good corrosion resistance. This steel was the basis for all future stainless knife steels, especially those like 420HC and AEB-L with the similar chromium content of 13%. The original name for S90V was 420V because the same chromium content of 420 was used in its development.

<p><strong>James P. Gill</strong></p>
<p>Gill was a metallurgist working for VASCO which is a company largely forgotten by knife collectors now, but made many significant contributions to tool steels. Gill developed the first commercially available high vanadium steels, such as the first 2% vanadium high speed steel in 1937 which evolved to become M2, and also M4 with its 4% vanadium and T15 with 5% vanadium. Many knife steels today continue to have high vanadium contents for improved wear resistance. Gill also wrote one of the first books on Tool Steels in 1934, which continued with new editions up until the 5th in 1998. These books on Tool Steels have been used by metallurgists for decades.

<p><strong>John A. Mathews</strong></p>
<p>Mathews worked for Crucible and Halcomb steel in the early 1900s and was highly influential for his steel developments and contributions to steel research. He patented the original T1 high speed steel with a small vanadium addition which improved the properties of early high speed steels. Vanadium additions were basically unheard of at the time but became very popular for various uses afterward. Mathews also developed the first “oil-hardening” steels including the popular O1 in 1905 which continues to be used in knives today.

<p><strong>Harry Johnstin</strong></p>
<p>Johnstin developed the steels Vasco Wear and Vasco Die in 1964. Vasco Wear is probably better known now as CruWear (Crucible branding of the same steel), though it is known by many names such as PD#1, Lescowear, and Z-Wear. Vasco Wear saw use in knives by the 70s and continues to be a popular choice in its various versions. A relatively unknown fact is that CPM-3V is in fact a powder metallurgy version of Vasco Die. Surprisingly, Crucible metallurgists were able to patent the powder metallurgy of Vasco Die despite the composition being previously patented (and expired), because the change to the microstructure and properties were deemed to be significant enough. Vasco Die and Vasco Wear also created the “8% Cr” tool steel category which became future steels like Vanadis 4 (before Vanadis 4 Extra), Vanadis 10, Sleipner, A8 Mod, DC53, Z-Tuff, CD#1, and others. You can read more about these steels in <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2019/06/03/the-history-of-3v-cru-wear-and-z-tuff-steel/">this article</a>.</p>

<p><strong>David J. Giles</strong></p>
<p>David Giles was a metallurgist who developed many tool steels for Latrobe steel. Giles developed several steels which have seen use in knives, including 440A in 1926 [1]. 440A has been used extensively in consumer knives ever since, and served as the basis for the higher carbon 440C, which was incredibly popular in production and custom knives in the 70s and 80s, and continues to be used today. 154CM was originally called “440C Mod” because they reduced the Cr in 440C and replaced it with Mo. Read more about 154CM history <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2018/05/21/154cm-development-properties-legacy/">in this article</a>. This 17-19% Cr base&nbsp; composition of 440A/440C served as the starting point for many future steels such as Elmax and S60V. Giles also developed 4-5% vanadium cold work steels A7 and D7 (as opposed to Gill who developed high speed steels) which served as a basis for future steels like CPM-10V. The patent-holder of 10V, Walter Haswell, previously worked at Latrobe steel and was a co-patent holder on several vanadium steels there as well, which used the same carbon-vanadium ratio equations that Giles had previously proposed [2]. D7 became Bohler’s powder metallurgy K190, which was further modified to <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/06/15/what-is-the-best-budget-knife-steel/">develop the popular stainless M390</a>.</p>

<p>Giles</p>
<p><strong>Kenneth Pinnow and William Stasko</strong></p>
<p>These two metallurgists were prolific tool steel patenters in the 1990s and developed several significant knife steels. One is CPM-3V, previously mentioned under Harry Johnstin. They also developed S90V [3], which is popular in knives in its own right but also led to S110V which is essentially a modified S90V, developed by Al Kajinic. The biggest contribution of S90V was the discovery that using 14% Cr (as opposed to 17-18% Cr in earlier steels like S60V and Elmax), led to a better utilization of vanadium additions for improved properties. This led to a “14% Cr plus vanadium” basis for several future Crucible steels like S30V. The S90V patent also lays out how they explored different levels of nitrogen in S90V, which wasn’t really utilized in the final composition, but increased nitrogen (~0.15-0.20%) was used in S30V, S110V, and S45VN. Pinnow and Stasko also patented CPM-15V which continues to be one of the highest wear resistance steels available [4]. Stasko was also co-listed with Andrzej Wojcieszynski for patenting CPM Rex 86 and CPM Rex 121 steels [5].</p>

<p><strong>Dick Barber</strong></p>
<p>Barber is best known for developing CPM-S30V steel, which has been one of the most popular steels used in high end production knives for nearly two decades. S30V was the first steel produced by Crucible to have an intentionally increased nitrogen content of about 0.20%. S30V also served as the starting point for the popular <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/01/13/s35vn-steel-properties-and-how-to-heat-treat/">S35VN</a>, and the more recent <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/01/15/spyderco-exclusive-cpm-spy27-steel-analysis/">SPY27</a> and <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2019/11/01/crucible-s45vn-steel/">S4…</a></p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Python <code>asyncio</code> concurrency are very good for I/O-bound tasks in Python with less overhead compared to <code>threading</code> methods. In some rare cases, since Python is a scripting language, we would like to run <code>asyncio</code> concurrency interactively in REPL (read-eval-print loop), the Python interactive shell. Because Python <code>asyncio</code> concurrency are single-process and single-thread, while they are being executed, we could not do anything in REPL but wait.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss how to use <code>threading</code> to control <code>asyncio</code> concurrency interactively.</p>

<h3 id="asyncio-concurrency">AsyncIO Concurrency</h3>

<h4 id="asyncio-base">AsyncIO Base</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>):</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>number</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>gather_func</span><span>():</span>
    <span># Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
</span>    <span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>gather</span><span>(</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>),</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>),</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>results</span>

<span># Use asyncio high-level API
</span><span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>gather_func</span><span>())</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If running this script in the REPL, we would have to wait three seconds after executing <code>results = asyncio.run(gather_func())</code> before we could execute <code>print(results)</code>. In some use cases, if it is requesting something from a remote server, it might have a chance to take forever, and we have to press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code> to kill.</p>

<h4 id="asyncio-timeout">AsyncIO Timeout</h4>

<p>If we don’t like waiting too long for the <code>asyncio</code> concurrency, we have options to timeout.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>):</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>number</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>gather_func</span><span>():</span>
    <span># Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
</span>    <span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>gather</span><span>(</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>),</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>),</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>results</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span># Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
</span>    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>wait_for</span><span>(</span><span>gather_func</span><span>(),</span> <span>timeout</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>)</span> <span># Try toggle timeout between 1 and None.
</span>    <span>except</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>TimeoutError</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"timeout!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>results</span>

<span># Use asyncio high-level API
</span><span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If running this script in the REPL, even if we used <code>asyncio.wait_for</code> with <code>timeout</code>, we could not do anything but wait during the <code>asyncio</code> concurrency. In addition, we have to set a fixed <code>timeout</code> value before we start the <code>asyncio</code> concurrency. We could not change our mind during waiting, unless we press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code> to kill.</p>

<h4 id="asyncio--thread">AsyncIO + Thread</h4>

<p>If we have two Python threads, one thread is responsible for the <code>asyncio</code> event loop which is take care of the concurrency schedules at the low-level, and the other one thread is responsible for the user interactive activities while still having control access to the <code>asyncio</code> concurrency.</p>

<p>Now, we could check and cancel <code>asyncio</code> concurrency anytime during its execution. However, there are a drawback of this method. The <code>concurrent.futures.Future</code> represents the status of coroutine running in the event loop. The coroutine might contain many tasks, but we will not be able to have access to any of them individually in another thread.</p>



<p>To overcome this, instead of merging multiple tasks into one single task, we could call <code>run_coroutine_threadsafe</code> multiple times for individual <code>coroutine</code>s and get multiple <code>future</code>s to control them individually.</p>

<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/16102948y9dIHsQN-2.png"></p><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Zulip Server 3.0 contains major visual design improvements, dramatic scalability and performance improvements, a new logo, and several of Zulip's most requested features to help users efficiently read, skim, search, and refer back to their messages. Zulip is 100% free and open-source software, and ships with translations for 16 languages.</p><p>Zulip 3.0 is our largest release ever, with over 4100 new commits since December's Zulip 2.1 release. A total of 110 people contributed commits to Zulip 3.0, bringing <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/">the Zulip server project</a> to 619 distinct code contributors. With <a href="https://zulip.com/team">54 people</a> who’ve contributed 100+ commits, Zulip has by far the most active open-source development community of any team chat software.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who's contributed to Zulip over the last few months, whether by writing code and docs, reporting issues, testing changes, translating, posting feedback on <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html">chat.zulip.org</a>, or just suggesting ideas! We could not do this without the hundreds of people giving back to the Zulip community.</p><h2 id="project-highlights"><strong>Project highlights</strong></h2><p>Today marks a release of the Zulip server, but lots of exciting work has happened outside the server codebase over the last several months as well. Highlights include:</p><ul><li>Zulip has experienced an extraordinary increase in usage in 2020 as a result of the ongoing pandemic changing how people work. &nbsp;It's been incredibly gratifying to <a href="https://monadical.com/posts/how-to-make-remote-work-part-two-zulip.html">hear from users</a> about how Zulip has helped them make remote work, conferences, teaching, and meetups successful. &nbsp;We now sponsor free Zulip Cloud Standard hosting for hundreds of worthy <a href="https://zulip.com/for/open-source/">open-source projects</a>, non-profits, <a href="https://zulip.com/for/research/">research groups</a>, and similar non-commercial organizations. &nbsp;New organizations can apply during the <a href="https://zulip.com/new">signup flow</a> or on the billing page.</li><li>Zulip Cloud has introduced <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2020/05/27/zulip-responds-to-pandemic-with-60-day-free-trial/">60-day free trials</a> for commercial users to help ensure that budget freezes aren't a barrier to experimenting with Zulip. &nbsp;Zulip has robust data import tools for <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack">Slack</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-mattermost">Mattermost</a>, and <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-gitter">Gitter</a>.</li><li>Zulip has a new logo!

Instead of doing gymnastics to clearly communicate a meeting time to an audience across the globe, you can <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#mention-a-time" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">use a date picker to write a time</a> which Zulip will show in each reader’s own timezone.</li><li>Zulip’s markup now supports <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#spoilers" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">spoiler blocks</a>.</li><li><a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/quote-and-reply" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Quote-and-reply</a> now generates a handy link to the referenced message.</li></ul><p><strong>Server</strong></p><ul><li>This release adds support for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal, and ends support for Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and Debian 9 Stretch (both of which were based on Python 3.5, which reaches EOL in September). See our documentation for <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">upgrading the operating system</a>.</li><li>Zulip now defaults to using PostgreSQL 12 on new installs, with support for PostgreSQL 10–12. (Previously, Zulip always used whatever PostgreSQL version came with the base OS release.) This release also adds a convenient new tool to <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-postgresql" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">upgrade </a><a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">PostgreSQL</a>.</li><li>Numerous major performance improvements. Zulip’s server-to-client push system scales 4x better than in Zulip 2.x, and several of the most common queries are much faster. Performance has improved dramatically for organizations like our own Zulip development community with 10,000s of user accounts.</li><li>We upgraded Django from 1.11.x to the latest LTS series, 2.2.x. We continue to love how every major Django release comes with great features that we hadn't realized we needed!</li><li>We're moving to a new versioning scheme with only 2 digits; the next maintenance release will be Zulip Server 3.1 and the next major release will be Zulip Server 4.0.</li></ul><p><strong>API and API Documentation</strong></p><ul><li>Zulip’s <a href="https://zulip.com/api" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">REST API documentation</a> received a major overhaul both of content and presentation. Most importantly, our automated tests now validate every API request, response, and example against the OpenAPI schemas used to generate the API documentation. Because the Zulip server has nearly 100% test coverage, this ensures the API documentation is always consistent with the implementation.</li><li>Zulip now has <a href="https://zulip.com/api/changelog" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">a detailed API changelog</a> which documents exactly when each API change was introduced. The <code>zulip_feature_level</code> field in <a href="https://zulipchat.com/api/get-server-settings" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">the server settings API</a> (which is more fine-grained than a server release), when combined with the changelog, allows client applications to know exactly what any given Zulip server supports.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>What is alert fatigue, and why should I care?</h3><p>Alert fatigue, or pager fatigue, is something that can drastically reduce even the most seasoned team’s ability to respond to incidents. This is the effect of receiving too many alerts, either because there are simply too many incidents occurring, or because your monitoring is picking up on insignificant issues and notifying you for things that do not require your attention (also known as alert noise). This can lower your team’s cognitive ability and capacity, making incident response a slow, difficult process. It can also lead your team to ignore crucial alerts, resulting in major incidents going unresolved or unnoticed until it’s too late.<br></p><p>A good parallel for understanding alert fatigue during an on-call rotation is that of the medical community. Reports have been written on the danger of allowing alerts to run your team. In an article in the <em>Journal of Graduate Medical Education</em>, Jess L. Rush et al states, “A large number of irrelevant alerts may result in alert fatigue... which may result in critical warnings being missed. The ECRI Institute, a nonprofit medical safety organization, listed alert fatigue as a top technology hazard. The consequences are illustrated when a child received 38 times the normal dose of an antibiotic largely due to this information being overshadowed by a number of clinically inconsequential alerts.”<br></p><p>In the worst case scenario, alert fatigue can be deadly. In our day-to-day operation, it’s more like death by a thousand cuts, rather than one fatal wound. However, the results are still the same; alert fatigue can wear down your team. It’s important to minimize alert or pager fatigue as much as possible, for the health and well being of your team members. After all, the health of your systems is dependent on the health of your people.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here are 5 tips on how to cut down on alert fatigue and improve your signal-to-noise ratio.</p><h3>Encourage service ownership</h3><p>Service ownership can help cut down on the amount of alerts you get, simply because it’s a way to help improve service robustness and minimize repetitive incidents. Service ownership can help:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Prevent code from being “thrown over the wall” and encourage learning. </strong>When developers are responsible for owning the services they build, it encourages better practices around shipping performant code. It’s easy to overlook potential flaws in your code when you’re not the one supporting the service, and focusing on reliability over shipping new features doesn’t seem as important when you’re not the one being paged over the weekend. But when service ownership is encouraged, developers will begin scrutinizing their code more thoroughly. Additionally, action items and learnings from incidents are more likely to be fed back into the software lifecycle (SDLC) when developers are in the loop on what issues are occurring.</li><li><strong>Keep teams under pressure from burning out by sharing the load. </strong>If your traditional ops team is up every night, working 70-hour work weeks and spending every weekend with their laptop, it should come as no surprise that eventually productivity will falter. People need breaks and time away from work. Without that time to themselves, teams under pressure will be susceptible to burnout. Management will be stuck in a cycle of hiring and training for roles they filled just a few months ago. Service ownership helps spread the on-call responsibilities out so that everyone has a turn carrying the pager. This can also have the unexpected benefit of familiarizing on-call engineers with their product a little more, as they’ll have to triage it during incidents. Service ownership helps balance on-call to keep engineers practiced and prepared.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Create the same incentive for everyone, limiting siloes. </strong>Service ownership can also help ease the tension between innovation and reliability, and will encourage even heavily siloed organizations to talk between teams in order to prioritize feature work and reliability work better. Everyone wants to move fast, sleep well, and have strong enough systems that they aren’t alerted about an issue every time they check their phone.</li></ul><h3>Create runbooks for your alerts</h3><p>What happens when you receive a notification that something is wrong with your system and you have no clue what it means, or why you’re receiving that alert? Maybe you have to parse through the alert conditions to suss out what the alert indicates, or maybe you need to ping a coworker and ask. Not knowing what to do with an alert also contributes to alert fatigue, because it increases the toil and time required to respond.<br></p><p>To resolve this, make sure that you create runbooks for the alert conditions you set. These runbooks should explain why you received this alert and what the alert is monitoring. <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices">Runbooks </a>should also contain the below information:<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Map of your system architecture:</strong> You’ll need to understand how each service functions and connects. This can help your on-call team have better visibility into dependencies that might be what ultimately triggers an alert.</li><li><strong>Service owners: </strong>This gives you someone to contact in the event that the alert is still not making sense, or the incident requires a technical expert for the service affected.</li><li><strong>Key procedures and checklist tasks: </strong>Checklists can give on-call engineers a place to start when looking into an alert. This helps preserve cognitive capacity for resolving the actual issue behind the alert.</li><li><strong>Identify methods to </strong><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices"><strong>bake into automation:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Does this alert actually require human intervention? If not, add in scripts that can handle this alert and which notify you only if the automation cannot fix the issue for you.</li><li><strong>Continue refining, learning, and improving: </strong>Runbooks are next to worthless if they aren't up to date. When you revisit these to make updates, take the opportunity to learn from them again, looking for new opportunities to automate and optimize.<br></li></ol><p>Runbooks can be a huge help to on-call engineers, but&nbsp; they need to be made easily accessible to the right people on the front lines. In addition to making sure your team has all the information they need to deal with alerts while on-call, it’s also important to take a deeper look at the on-call schedule you maintain.</p><blockquote>Maybe you have to parse through the alert conditions to suss out what the alert indicates, or maybe you need to ping a coworker and ask. Not knowing what to do with an alert also contributes to alert fatigue, because it increases the toil and time required to respond.</blockquote><h3>Take a closer look at your on-call schedule</h3><p>Maybe you don’t have superfluous alerts or an overwhelming amount of incidents to tackle, but some of your team members are constantly burning the midnight oil and experiencing alert fatigue. This is likely an issue of improper load balancing of&nbsp; the on-call schedule, rotation, and escalation policies.<br></p><p>One way to make sure that your on-call schedule minimizes alert fatigue is to take a qualitative approach rather than a quantitative one. Imagine you have two engineers. <strong>Engineer A</strong> spends a full week on call and receives notifications twice about suboptimal service function. Each alert triggers an incident which requires an hour to resolve.<br></p><p><strong>Engineer B</strong> spends only a weekend on call and receives seven notifications. Three of those seven are deemed irrelevant (more on how to limit this later!), and the other four trigger incidents which take two hours each to resolve.<br></p><p>Who should be on call next? And who needs a break? By measuring time spent on call, it would seem that <strong>Engineer A</strong> needs a break. However, it’s <strong>Engineer B </strong>who is spending more time directly dealing with interrupt work, and likely more stressed by alert fatigue. By taking a proactive and qualitative approach, managers can anticipate burnout and fatigue before it becomes an issue.</p><p>In addition to looking at who is on call, you should also be checking in on those who were pinged on their day off to help. You may notice that some grey beards on your team are answering calls when they shouldn’t have to. In this case, you’ll need to work to <a href="https://www.blameless.com/resources/business-continuity-guide">eliminate SPOFs</a> (single points of failure), and train your on-call engineers so that when they’re scheduled to handle the pager, they don’t need to always phone a friend.</p><h3>Set SLOs to create guidelines for alerts</h3><p>Sometimes the problem isn’t that you have too many incidents; instead it could just be that you’re alerting on the wrong things, or set the wrong alerting thresholds. To minimize alert fatigue, it’s important to distinguish what is worth alerting on and what isn’t. One way to do this is with SLOs.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs</a> are internal thresholds that allow teams to guard their customer satisfaction. These thresholds are set based on <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">SLIs</a>, or singular metrics captured by the service’s monitorable data. SLIs take into account points on a user journey that are most important to a customer, such as latency, availability, throughput, or freshness of the data at certain junctions. These metrics (stated as good events/valid events over a period of time) indicate what your customers will care most about. SLOs are the objectives that you must meet to keep them happy.<br></p><p>Imagine that your service is an online shopping platform. Your customers care most about availability. In this case, you’ve determined that to keep customers happy, your service requires 99.9% availability. That means you can only have 43.83 minutes of downtime per month before customer happiness will be affected.<br></p><p>Based on this, you have wiggle room for planned maintenance or shipping new features that might risk a potential blip. But how much wiggle room are you comfortable with? An error budget policy is an agreement that all stakeholders make on what will be done in the event an SLO is threatened.<br></p><p>So imagine that out of your 43.83 minutes, you’ve used 21 minutes. Do you need minute-by minute alerts? Not likely. Instead, you’ll want to set up alerting thresholds that let you know when you’ve reached certain milestones such as 25%, 50%, 75%, and so on. Maybe you even automate these alerts so …</p></div></div>

    Posted on July 13, 2020
    
        by Troels Henriksen
    
</p>

<p>Futhark is supposed to be a safe programming language. This implies that risky operations, such as <code>a[i]</code> which indexes an array at some arbitrary index, should be protected with a dynamic check. While C programmers are famous for never making mistakes, and therefore C does not perform do such checking, the vast majority of programming languages do check array indexes, usually by generating code like this:</p>
<pre><code>if (i &lt; 0 || i &gt; n) {
  // throw exception

  // OR print error message

  // OR terminate program

  // OR do anything else
}</code></pre>
<p>This immediately changes the control flow of the program based on the bounds check. Usually the implementation challenge is not how to perform such checks in the first place, but how to eliminate them in cases where the compiler can statically determine that the check can never fail. However, for Futhark we would like to generate code for GPUs, and GPUs are great at turning solved problems unsolved.</p>
<p>In this post I will describe why it took Futhark <em>years</em> to get support for bounds-checking on the GPU, how we recently solved the problem, and what the performance is like. This post is a rewritten extract of a <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/publications/hlpp20.pdf">recently presented paper</a>, which you can read if you are particularly interested in the details of bounds checking.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-execution"><a href="#asynchronous-execution" id="asynchronous-execution-link" title="asynchronous-execution">Asynchronous execution</a></h2>
<p>The basic problem is that the GPU functions as a <em>co-processor</em> that receives data and code from the CPU, but which is then processed at the GPUs own pace. Explicit synchronisation and copying (both slow) is necessary to exchange information between the CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>GPU code is organised as <em>kernels</em> (no relation to operating systems, more like functions), and when we launch code on the GPU, we tell it to run a specific kernel with a specific number of threads, with some specific arguments. It’s a lot like performing an asynchronous remote procedure call. And similarly to a remote procedure, a kernel that contains an index that is out of bounds has no way of directly affecting the control flow of the CPU. In practice, our only option is to simply write a value to a distinguished memory location indicating that things have gone wrong, and then terminate the running GPU thread:</p>
<pre><code>if (i &lt; 0 || i &gt;= n) {
  *global_failure = 1;
  return;  // Terminate GPU thread
}</code></pre>
<p>On the CPU, whenever we launch a GPU kernel, we then <em>block</em> until the kernel is done running, copy back the <code>global_failure</code> value, and check whether a bounds error occurred:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-gpu-cpu-sync.png" alt="A diagram of checking for errors after every GPU kernel."></p>
<p>Surely reading a single number after every kernel (which usually processes tens of thousands of array elements) must be fast? Let’s check the overhead on the Futhark benchmark suite, measured on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-overhead-sync.png" alt="Slowdown of synchronous bounds checking compared to no bounds checking."></p>
<p>The vertical axis shows the <em>slowdown</em> of synchronous bounds checking compared to not doing any bounds checking. The overhead is pretty bad: A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean">geomean</a> of <em>1.66x</em> , and more than <em>6x</em> on the worst affected benchmarks. I’m only measuring those benchmarks that require bounds checking <em>at all</em>, so the mean overhead across all benchmarks would be lower. Still, this is too slow to be practical.</p>
<p>GPUs perform well when given a large queue of work to process at their own pace, not when they constantly stop to transfer 32 bits back to the CPU for inspection, and have to wait for a go-ahead before proceeding. To speed this up, we need to cut the amount of synchronisation.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back and consider why we do bounds checking in the first place: we want to avoid corrupting memory by writing to invalid addresses, and we want to avoid making bad control flow decisions based on reading garbage. This implies that we have to do bounds checking <em>immediately</em> whenever we access an array. But since the GPU’s control flow is completely decoupled from what is happening on the CPU, the CPU doesn’t actually need to know immediately that something has gone wrong - it only needs to be informed when it eventually copies data from the GPU, so that it knows not to trust it. The actual <em>check</em> still needs to be done immediately on the GPU, but copying back <code>global_failure</code> to the CPU can wait until the CPU would in any case need to synchronise with the GPU:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-gpu-cpu-async.png" alt="A diagram of delaying error checking."></p>
<p>This amortises the copying overhead over potentially many kernel launches. But we’re still not quite done, as kernel <em>i+1</em> may contain unchecked operations that are safe if and only if the preceding kernel <em>i</em> completed successfully. To address this, we add a prelude to every GPU kernel body where each thread checks whether <code>global_failure</code> is set:</p>
<pre><code>// Prelude added to every GPU kernel
if (*global_failure) {
  return;
}</code></pre>
<p>If so, that must mean one of the preceding kernels has encountered a failure, and so the all threads of the current kernel terminate immediately. Checking <code>global_failure</code> on the GPU is much faster than checking it on the CPU, because it does not involve any synchronisation or copying. The overhead is a single easily cached global memory read for every thread, which is in most cases negligible. Asynchronous checking performs like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-overhead-async.png" alt="Slowdown of synchronous bounds checking compared to no bounds checking."></p>
<p>Much better! The mean overhead is down to <em>1.07x</em> (compared to <em>1.66x</em> before), and the maximum overhead is <em>1.4x</em> (<em>6x</em> before). The slowest program is now the <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks/blob/master/rodinia/srad/srad.fut">srad</a> benchmark, which is structured roughly as follows:</p>

<p>The <code>reduce</code> runs on the GPU but produces a scalar, which in Futhark’s compilation model is copied back to the CPU where a tiny amount of sequential computation takes place, after which it is used to update the <code>image</code> array in various ways. The fact that we copy a value (even just a single number!) back to the CPU forces us to do a full synchronisation and also check <code>global_failure</code>. This is because the compiler is conservative - it does not understand that <code>x</code> is not going to be used for any CPU-side control flow, but is instead going to be sent right back to the GPU. Since each instance of <code>reduce</code> and <code>map</code> run for extremely short periods (little more than a dozen microseconds each), the communication cost becomes significant. This was already a problem, but bounds checking makes it worse.</p>
<p>The solution to this is not directly related to bounds checking at all, but is about refining our compilation model such that individual scalars are more aggressively kept on the GPU, if we can determine that their value is not truly needed on the CPU. As a side effect, this will allow us to delay checking <code>global_failure</code> until the entire outermost sequential loop has run, which will make the overhead of bounds checking essentially zero. But this is future work.</p>
<h2 id="cross-thread-communication"><a href="#cross-thread-communication" id="cross-thread-communication-link" title="cross-thread-communication">Cross-thread communication</a></h2>
<p>So far, we have assumed that a GPU thread, upon encountering an error, can safely terminate itself, or even the entire kernel. Unfortunately, reality is not so forgiving. A GPU thread can terminate itself, sure, but this can induce deadlocks if the kernel contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_(computer_science)">barriers</a>, because other threads may be waiting for the now-terminated thread. Life would be easier if the prevailing GPU APIs (CUDA and OpenCL) provided a way for a single thread to unilaterally abort execution of the entire kernel, but they don’t. The solution to this is a little hairy, and involves the failing thread jumping ahead to the next barrier instead of simply terminating, then after each barrier checking whether any threads have failed. See <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/publications/hlpp20.pdf">the paper</a> for the full details. It’s a solution that relies heavily on all communication being under the control of the compiler, so it’s not something you could do for a low-level GPU language.</p>
<h2 id="optimisations"><a href="#optimisations" id="optimisations-link" title="optimisations">Optimisations</a></h2>
<p>All effective and elegant implementation techniques must inevitably be followed by a collection of ad-hoc micro-optimisations of dubious impact, and bounds checking in Futhark is no different. Some of the special cases we handle are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Certain particularly simple kernels are able to execute safely even when previous kernels have failed, typically because they merely copy or replicate memory. Matrix transposition is an example of such a kernel. For these kernels we can eliminate all failure checking entirely, because bounds failures cannot result in memory becoming <em>inaccessible</em>, it can only result in the values stored being <em>wrong</em>, and these simple kernels are not sensitive to the values they are copying.</li>
<li>Some kernels may contain no bounds checks. They still need to check whether any previous kernels have failed, but do not need to be careful with respect to barriers and such.</li>
<li>At run-time, whenever we enqueue a kernel, we have dynamic knowledge of whether any kernels with bounds checks have been enqueued since the last time <code>global_failure</code> was checked. That is, we know dynamically whether <code>global_failure</code> is <em>certainly unset</em>. If so, we can pass that information along to the kernel as a kernel argument, which means the kernel does not have to check the value of <code>global_failure</code> in its prelude.</li>
</ol>
<p>The impact of these optimisations (and others covered in the paper) is quite minor, as shown in the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-overhead.png" alt="Slowdown of synchronous bounds checking compared to no bounds checking."></p>
<p>Most of the optimisations were motivated by micro-benchmarks, where the impact is more significant. On these benchmarks, they reduce the mean overhead to <em>1.04x</em> (from <em>1.07x</em>), and have no impact on the maximum overhead. Useful, but not crucial the way asynchronous checking is.</p>
<h2 id="error-messages"><a href="#error-messages" id="error-messages-link" title="error-messages">Error messages</a></h2>
<p>As discussed above, <code>global_failure</code> contains only a single bit of information: did the program fail or not? But the modern programmer is accustomed to luxuries such as being told <em>where</em> it failed, so clearly this will not do. The solution is simple. At compile time, we associate each bounds check with a unique number, a <em>failure code</em>, with a <code>global_failure</code> value of <em>-1</em> meaning <em>no error so far</em>. When a bounds check fails, the thread writes the failure code corresponding to the bounds check. At compile-time we also construct a table that maps each failure code to a <code>printf()</code>-style format string such as the following:</p>
<pre><code>"index %d out of bounds for array of size %d"</code></pre>
<p>For simplicity, <code>%d</code> is the only format specifier that can occur, but each distinct format string can contain a different number of format specifiers. We …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Tesla may well be the biggest driver of China’s journey towards technological self-reliance, as the “Tech Cold War” between the U.S. and China deepens. This observation wasn’t obvious to me until I listened (three times) to Elon Musk’s Q&amp;A session at the 2020 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai earlier this month.</p><p>【想看<a href="https://interconnected.blog/tesla-china-the-tech-cold-war/#chinese-version-below">中文的读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>While most of the media coverage focused on<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/09/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-very-close-to-level-5-autonomous-driving/"> Musk’s bold proclamation</a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/07/09/elon-musk-tesla-will-have-level-5-self-driving-cars-this-year/#1cd954a32d1d"> that Tesla is</a><a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-tesla-close-level-5-autonomy"> very close to achieving</a> Level-5 autonomous driving capabilities, <strong>the entirety of what he said</strong> during the Q&amp;A has far-reaching implications, technologically and geopolitically.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mwe2ABPkZLU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="local-hire-original-engineering-open-patents">Local Hire, Original Engineering, Open Patents</h2><p>Musk’s Q&amp;A was, first and foremost, an aggressive recruiting pitch for the engineering team that Tesla is building in China. What’s most noteworthy is his emphasis that the Tesla China team will be doing “original engineering”.</p><p>This emphasis is important for three reasons:</p><p><strong>1. Local optimization:</strong> for self-driving to work well, where your engineers are physically located play a surprisingly important role. Musk shared that Tesla’s Autopilot works best in California, because the company’s engineers are mostly in California, thus they can do local optimization most effectively to adapt to the reality in California. The plan is: once self-driving works well in California, the software can be adapted to other locations with varying degrees of further local optimization.</p><p>In order for Tesla's Autopilot to work well in China, it needs a local engineering team capable of what its team is doing in California. Thus, “original engineering” makes perfect product sense if Tesla wants to deliver self-driving cars in China -- a growing electric vehicle market where Tesla is taking a large chunk, according to research by ARK Investment. Beyond the engineering and product rationale, it is also <strong>a killer recruiting pitch for the best and brightest</strong>; no talented engineer wants to spend the day refactoring and adapting someone else’s code.</p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png 854w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>2. Friendlier regulators:</strong> In his Q&amp;A, Musk’s confidence in achieving L5 is tempered by the reality that neither he nor anyone else knows what is the level of safety that must be achieved to convince regulators. Twice as safe as a human driver? 10-times? 100-times? Or in Musk’s words, how many 9’s after 99% is needed? We don’t know.</p><p>Regulators play a decisive role in the pace of self-driving advancement, more so than most other tech sectors. For a regulator to make a judgment on the safety threshold, it’s a combination of hard evidence and political will plus incentives. Assuming we have the same safety evidence, then the Chinese government currently has more appetite to experiment with and invest in AI than the U.S. government. <strong>Thus, Chinese regulators of all levels are more incentivized to say “yes” to things, while their American counterparts are more incentivized to say “no”.</strong> This political will was on full display at this AI conference, where the Party Committee Secretary of Shanghai, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Qiang">Li Qiang</a>, more or less presided over the entire keynote session, where almost every speaker ritualistically praised his leadership at the beginning of each talk. Li’s presence is a big deal, as Shanghai tries to lead China’s AI future, having lost out on the other tech trend booms to Beijing, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. Tesla’s China GigaFactory is already located in Shanghai. It’s likely that Tesla will continue to receive more favorable regulatory treatment in Shanghai than in California or anywhere else in the U.S.</p><p><strong>3. Reduced risk of sanctions:</strong> With “original engineering”, Tesla China creates original IP that will not be subjected to future U.S. sanctions. Thus, this approach is effective for recruiting and important for Tesla’s own long-term development. China, in turn, will rightfully have access to the IP generated from Tesla China.</p><p>But what’s more important is that Tesla doesn’t care about patents anyways. In 2014, it decided to open source its entire patent portfolio related to building an electric vehicle. In Musk’s mind, patent protection is an impediment not accelerant to technological advancement. In <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you">his blog post</a> announcing the no-patent decision, he wrote:</p><blockquote><em>“<strong>Technology leadership is not defined by patents</strong>, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the <strong>ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers</strong>. We believe that</em><a href="https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-pledge"><em> applying the open source philosophy to our patents</em></a><em> will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard.” [Bold emphasis mine]</em></blockquote><p>Tesla is flexing its muscle to attract and motivate the most talented engineers in China. When they do develop the self-driving technology needed for Tesla (and yes, I believe it is a “when” not “if”), chances are all that technology will be open sourced for anyone in China and the world to do the same. <strong>Open source technology</strong>, as the Linux Foundation <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2020/07/understanding-us-export-controls-with-open-source-projects/">clarified in its whitepaper earlier this month</a>, is <strong>not subjected </strong>to the U.S. government’s various export control restrictions.</p><p>Of course, achieving self-driving is not just an algorithm and software engineering challenge, but also a hardware one. To understand that piece of the puzzle, let’s look at Tesla’s custom-designed Full Self-Driving (FSD) chip in the context of China’s current chip manufacturing capabilities.</p><h2 id="what-is-fsd">What is FSD?</h2><p>Tesla began developing its own <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC">FSD chip</a> in 2016. In 2019, it began volume production and deployed these FSD chips inside Model X, S, and 3. It is an 8-bit chip (not the more powerful 32-bit or 64-bit general purpose chip), in order to satisfy the specific computation needs of a self-driving car but nothing more. Thus far, Samsung manufactures the chips using its 14nm process at its Austin, Texas foundry. A self-driving chip does not have as high a requirement in terms of form factor (or size) as a smartphone or smaller device, thus the 14nm process is sufficient.</p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg 745w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Tesla FSD board. Source: https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC</figcaption></figure><p>The FSD chip is highly optimized to do one particular mathematical operation very efficiently: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:properties-of-matrix-multiplication/a/matrix-multiplication-dimensions"><strong>dot product</strong></a>. It’s how you do matrix multiplications -- an operation that a neural network needs to do many many times, especially for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network</a>. In order for a self-driving car to “see” what’s going on while driving, it has to do a lot of dot products to compute all the image data gathered from its surrounding, frame by frame, before deciding what to do, if anything. And the car must be able to do this constantly for a long time without overheating or slowing down performance. The FSD’s performance apparently exceeds an Nvidia alternative’s by 21-times, while consuming much less power.</p><p>Each Tesla car is installed with two of these chips to add redundancy and improve decision-making: if the two chips “disagree”, the decision is thrown out and the computer starts a new compute and inference cycle on new data. <strong>Essentially, each Tesla has two “brains” to keep each other honest.</strong></p><h2 id="can-china-make-fsd">Can China Make FSD?</h2><p>As I’ve described in a previous deep dive post, <strong>“</strong><a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/"><strong>RISC-V, China, Nightingales</strong></a><strong>”, </strong>China’s largest chip foundry SMIC does have 14nm capabilities. In fact, SMIC’s co-CEO Liang Mong-song, who is credited with bringing the 14nm capabilities to the foundry, was a TSMC veteran and also instrumental in helping Samsung first achieve its own 14nm process, which is being used to manufacture the FSD chips right now. These chips are <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC">designed based on the ARMv8.0-A</a> instruction set architecture (ISA), which isn’t subject to U.S. sanctions since ARM is a UK company.</p><p>That being said, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html">UK recently banned Huawei completely</a>, reversing its earlier decision that allowed Huawei to build the “non-core” portions of its 5G network. This decision may signal a stronger willingness by UK regulators to either push out Chinese companies or prevent technologies from going to China, as it moves closer to the U.S. in this Tech Cold War.</p><p>To further muddle the picture, Softbank <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-explores-options-for-chip-designer-arm-holdings-11594672437">who owns ARM is mulling a sale</a> after buying it for $32 billion USD four years ago. Meanwhile, RISC-V, the open source ISA, is not yet mature enough to design a self-driving optimized chip like the FSD</p><p>Needless to say, there are many moving pieces to keep track of. SMIC is facing many challenges as it grows into a world-class chip foundry. It has had trouble acquiring advanced lithography technology from the Dutch company ASML, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-holding-usa-china-insight/trump-administration-pressed-dutch-hard-to-cancel-china-chip-equipment-sale-sources-idUSKBN1Z50HN">due to pressure from the Trump administration</a>. Without ASML’s technology, SMIC will have a hard time advancing beyond the 14nm process to 7nm or denser processes. It will also have trouble acquiring other EDA tools to scale its production capacity, because the<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7phT1v0G45m87JU6s7W5bA"> dominant suppliers are mostly American</a>. Depending on who you ask, SMIC’s future is still pretty bleak, even with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/smic-chinas-biggest-chipmaker-surges-in-shanghai-listing.html">its successful IPO</a> on the Shanghai STAR market.</p><p>But at the end of the day, Tesla needs 14nm capabilities and SMIC has them. In fact, <strong>it would make sense for Tesla to be a customer of China-made chips for its China-made cars</strong>. This arrangement will help Tesla avoid future restrictions if U.S. sanctions widen to include its current chip production in Austin. Producing FSD chips at scale for a high-caliber customer like Tesla will push SMIC to up its game on manufacturing quality and operational efficiencies. Combined with the software advancement in AI from the local engineering team, Tesla can end up giving China’s technology ecosystem quite a boost.</p><h2 id="ambition-and-pragmatism">Ambition and Pragmatism</h2><p>Tesla is not only an ambitious company, it’s also a pragmatic one. <strong>Ambitious pragmatism</strong> is what a company, and I’d argue a country, needs to both survive and thrive. In the last Cold War between the U.S. and U.S.S.R., there was actually a lot of ambitious pragmatism that catalyzed technological advancements, like rocketry, satellites, and the space program. So far, the current conflict between the U.S. and China looks totally …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Remote sensing instruments like <a href="https://gedi.umd.edu/">NASA’s GEDI</a>, which is mounted to the <a href="https://iss.jaxa.jp/en/kiboexp/ef/">Japanese Experiment Module – Exposed Facility (JEM-EF)</a> on the International Space Station (ISS), produce a massive amount of data and one of the tools scientists use when working with those data is a <em>geo-locator</em>–a geographic coordinates search engine.</p>



<p>GEDI, launched in 2018, is the most powerful lidar instrument in orbit today. The files for version 1 data, which had an initial public release in early 2020, are organized by orbit instead of by <em>tile</em> or grid system. This presents a unique challenge to searching the data efficiently.</p>



<p>This paper looks at how a software developer or scientist might go about creating a GEDI geo-locator–similar in functionality to existing NASA offerings. We dive into how the coordinate data is structured, ways to mathematically generalize the orbit data, and we then build a solution using Python. In a series of explanations we move through an arc of exploration as we think about solving the challenges encountered. The resulting prototype geo-locator leverages a number of Python libraries popular in GIS today and achieves a considerable level of accuracy and performance.</p>

<h2>Don’t bury the lede</h2>



<p>We’re working on a thing to make Firefox start faster! It appears to work! Here’s a video showing off a before (left) and after (right):</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="625" height="352" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/027tOvYZw88?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>

<h2>Improving Firefox Startup Time With The about:home Startup Cache</h2>



<p>For the past year or so, the Firefox Desktop Front-End Performance team has been concentrating on making improvements to browser startup performance.</p>



<p>The launching of an application like Firefox is quite complex. Meticulous profiling of Firefox startup in various conditions has, thankfully, helped reveal a number of opportunities where we can make improvements. We’ve been evaluating and addressing these opportunities, and several have made it into the past few Firefox releases.</p>



<p>This blog post is about one of those improvements that is currently in the later stages of development. I’m going to describe the improvement, and how we went about integrating it.</p>



<p>In a default installation of Firefox, the first (and only) tab that loads is about:home<sup id="rf1-3036"><a href="#fn1-3036" title="This is only true if the user hasn’t just restarted after applying an update, and if they haven’t set a custom home page or configured Firefox to restore their previous session on start." rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="3038" data-permalink="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/2020/07/13/improving-firefox-startup-time-with-the-abouthome-startup-cache/abouthome/" data-orig-file="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abouthome.png" data-orig-size="1144,853" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="abouthome" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abouthome-300x224.png" data-large-file="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abouthome-1024x764.png" src="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/xabouthome-1024x764.png.pagespeed.ic.IW4h6O6qkj.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/xabouthome-1024x764.png.pagespeed.ic.IW4h6O6qkj.png 1024w, https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abouthome-300x224.png 300w, https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abouthome-768x573.png 768w, https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abouthome-624x465.png 624w, https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abouthome.png 1144w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The about:home page is actually the same thing that appears when you open a new tab (about:newtab). The fact that they have different addresses allows us to treat their loading differently.</p>



<p>Your about:home might look slightly different from the above — depending on your locale, it may or may not include the Pocket stories.</p>



<p>Do not be fooled by what appears to be a very simple page of images and text. This page is actually quite sophisticated under the hood. It is designed to be customized by the user in the following ways:</p>



<p>Users can</p>



<ul><li>Collapse or expand sections</li><li>Remove sections entirely</li><li>Reorganize the order of their Top Sites by dragging and dropping</li><li>Pin and unpin Top Sites to their positions</li><li>Add their own custom Top Sites with custom thumbnails</li><li>Add or remove search engines from their Top Sites</li><li>Change the number of rows in the Top Sites and Recommended by Pocket sections</li><li>Choose to have the Highlights composed of any of the following:<ul><li>Visited pages</li><li>Recent bookmarks</li><li>Recent downloads</li><li>Pages recently saved to Pocket</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>The user can customize these things at any time, and any open copies of the page are expected to reflect those customizations immediately.</p>



<p>There are further complexities beyond user customization. The page is also designed to be easy for our design and engineering teams to experiment with reorganizing the layout and composition of the page so that they can test variations on its layout in the wild.</p>



<p>The about:home page also has special privileges not afforded to normal websites. It can</p>



<ul><li>Save and remove bookmarks</li><li>Add pages to Pocket</li><li>Cause the URL bar to be focused and selected</li><li>Show thumbnails for pages that the user has visited</li><li>Access both high and normal resolution favicons</li><li>Render information about the user’s recent activity (recent page visits, downloads, saves to Pocket, etc.)</li></ul>



<p>So while at first glance, this appears to be a static page of just images and text, rest assured that the page can do much more.</p>



<p>Like the Firefox Developer Tools UI, about:home is written with the help of the React and Redux libraries. This has allowed the about:home development team to create sophisticated, reusable, and composable components that could be easily tested using modern JavaScript testing methods.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this complexity and customizability comes at a cost. The page needs to request a state object from the parent process in order to have the Redux store populated and to have React render it. Essentially, the page is dynamically rendering itself after the markup of the page loads.</p>



<p>Startup is a critical time for an application. The user has expressed a need for their browser, and we have an obligation to serve the user as quickly and efficiently as possible. The user’s time is a resource that we should not squander. Similarly, because so much needs to occur during startup,<sup id="rf2-3036"><a href="#fn2-3036" title="You can think of startup like a traveling circus coming to town. You have to get the trucks and trailers parked, get the tents set up, hook up power, then lighting and sound … it’s a big, complex operation, and we haven’t even shot a clown out of a cannon yet." rel="footnote">2</a></sup> disk reads, disk writes, and CPU time are also considered precious resources. They should only be used if there’s no other choice.</p>



<p>In this case, we believed that the CPU time and disk accesses spent constructing the state object and dynamically rendering the about:home page was competing with all of the other CPU and disk access happening during startup, and this was slowing us down from presenting about:home to the user in a timely way.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, in my mind there are four broad approaches to performance problems once a bottleneck has been identified.</p>



<ul><li>You can widen the bottleneck (make the operations more efficient)</li><li>You can divide the bottleneck (split the work into smaller slices that can be done over a longer period of time with rests in between)</li><li>You can move the bottleneck (defer work until later when it seems that there is less competition for resources, or move it to a different thread)</li><li>You can remove the bottleneck (don’t do the work)</li></ul>



<p>We started by trying to apply the last two approaches, wondering what startup performance would be like if the page did not render itself dynamically, but was instead a static page generated periodically and pulled off of the disk at startup.</p>



<h2>Prototype when possible</h2>



<p>The first step to improving something is finding a way to measure it. Thankfully, we already have a number of logged measurements for startup. One of those measurements gives us the time from process start to rendering the Top Sites section of about:home. This is not a perfect measurement—ideally, we’d measure to the point that the page finally “settles” and stops changing<sup id="rf3-3036"><a href="#fn3-3036" title="<a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1637024&quot;>We’re working on something like that</a>" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>—but for this project, this measurement served our purposes.</p>



<p>Before investing a bunch of time into a potential improvement, it’s usually a good idea to try to see if what you’re gaining is worth the development time. It’s not always possible to build a prototype for performance improvements, but in this case it was.</p>



<p>The team quickly threw together a static copy of about:home and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614352">hacked together a patch to load that document during startup, rather than dynamically rendering the page</a>. We then tested that page on our reference hardware. As of this writing, it’s been about five months since that test was done, but <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614352#c2">according to this comment</a>, the prototype yielded what appears to be an almost 20% win on time from process start to about:home painting Top Sites.</p>



<p>So, with that information, we thought we had a real improvement opportunity here. We decided to proceed with the idea, and began a long arduous search for “the right way to do it.”</p>



<h2>Pre-production</h2>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, about:home is complex. The infrastructure that powers it is complex. Coupled with the fact that no one on the Firefox Front-End Performance team had spent much time studying React and Redux meant that we had a lot of learning to do.</p>



<p>The first step was to get some React and Redux fundamentals under our belt. This meant building some small toy applications and getting familiar with the framework idioms and how things are organized.</p>



<p>With that grounding, the next step was to start reading the code — starting from the entrypoint into the code that powers about:home when the browser starts. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvDPcdqaZ7140nabNonQpD5Ln_nrAcJGBgFCJFG_0MM/edit#heading=h.1w5efh70rcvh">This was an intense period of study</a> that branched into many different directions. Part of the complexity was because much of the code is asynchronous and launched work on different threads, which introduced some non-determinism. While it is generally good for responsiveness to move work off of the main thread, it can lead to some complex reading and interpretation of the code when more than two threads are involved.</p>



<p>A tool we used during this analysis was the <a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/docs/#/">Firefox Profiler</a>, to get a realistic sense of the order of executions during startup. These profiles helped to inform much of our reading of the code.</p>



<p>This analysis helped us solidify our mental model of how about:home loads. With that model in place, it was much easier to propose practical approaches for introducing a static about:home document into the ecosystem of pre-existing code. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvDPcdqaZ7140nabNonQpD5Ln_nrAcJGBgFCJFG_0MM/edit#heading=h.1w5efh70rcvh">The Firefox Front-End Performance team documented our findings and recommendations</a> and then presented them to the team that originally built the about:home system to ensure that we were all on the same page and that we hadn’t missed anything critical. They were already aware that we were investigating potential performance improvements, and had very useful feedback for us, as well as historical product decision context that clarified our understanding.</p>



<p>Critically, we presented our recommendation for loading a static about:home page at startup and ensured that there were no upcoming plans for about:home that would break our mental model or render the recommendation no longer valid. Thankfully, it sounded like we were aligned and fine to proceed with our plan.</p>



<p>So what was the plan? We knew that since about:home is quite dynamic and can change over time<sup id="rf4-3036"><a href="#fn4-3036" title="As the user browses, bookmarks and downloads things, their Highlights and Top Sites sections might change. If Pocket is enabled, new stories will also be downloaded periodically." rel="footnote">4</a></sup> we needed a startup cache for about:home that could be periodically updated during the course of a browsing session. We would then load from that cache at startup. Clearly, I’m glossing over some details here, but that was the general plan.</p>



<p>As usual, no plan survives breakfast, and as we started to architect our solution, we identified things we would need to change along the way.</p>



<h2>Development</h2>



<p>We knew that the process that loads about:home would need to be able to read from the about:home startup cache. We also knew that about:home can potentially contain information about what pages the user has visited, and that about:home can do privileged things that normal web pages cannot. It seemed that this project would be a good opportunity to finish a project that was started (and mothballed) a year or so earlier: creating a special privileged content process for about:home. We would load about:home in that process, and add assertions to ensure that privileged actions from about:home could only happen from that content process type<sup id="rf5-3036"><a href="#fn5-3036" title="It’s vitally important that content processes have limited abilities. That way, if they’re ever compromised by a bad actor, there are limits to what damage they can do. The assertions mentioned in this case mean that if a compromised content process tries to “pretend” to be the privileged about content process by sending one of its messages, that the parent process will terminate that content process immediately." rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>



<p>So getting the “privileged about content process”<sup id="rf6-3036"><a href="#fn6-3036" title="Naming is hard." rel="footnote">6</a></sup> fixed up and ready for shipping was the first step.</p>



<p>This also paved the way for …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[Few thoughts on habits and touch typing]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13GIgrGdslD9oQ/source.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Mastering tools is a must-have in any profession. Can you imagine a construction worker trying to find a button to start a drill each time he needs to use it? Or a violinist trying to find appropriate strings while performing Beethoven's Violin Sonata no.9? It comes striking to me that so many software engineers with years of experience still struggle with something they do many times every day – typing.</p>

<p>Learning touch typing was a life changer for me, and I was the same. I always postponed practicing it, so after a few years of working in the industry, I almost developed my way of typing – not that efficient but still – using more than two fingers.</p>

<p>One day I've said enough is enough and started practicing a few minutes every day.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/EDFKxd7.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see I suck on creating habits and had a few approaches to practice sessions, but the 1st of August 2016 was the day for me.</p>

<p>After intensive practice weeks, you can see how the frequency of practicing has dropper but has not stopped, which is a key to keep up your fingers in good shape.</p>

<p>I still do a few minutes of practice every day after those four years. I can say it becomes a habit of mine. It became my first conscious habit where the end goal was to get some skill.</p>

<p>I've tried many times to build up a good habit and failed miserably, I've wanted to read a few minutes a week, do learning for a few minutes, learn languages. The problem was that I was not using those skills in my day to day routine (I've been focusing on too much at once too); hence the only time I was exposed to those skills were those few minutes a day. And forgot about it for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Some learnings from keeping my habits for a few years:</p>
<ul><li><p>I've learned a lot about myself and how should I approach any task that I'd like to become a habit of mine (I successfully do WaniKani lessons for three years now almost every day), most important thing is to use the skills you practice also outside the practice sessions (even when you use it inefficiently for the time being)</p></li>

<li><p>The habit should have a practical influence on how you work or live, having vague habit as “reading 10 minutes every day” does not work for me at all as I cannot see a clear goal of doing so (“getting wiser” is as vague as the habit itself). On the other hand, “learn how Ruby works under the hood by reading Ruby Under the Microscope book” makes much more sense to me. I have to quantify the habit to see the progress.</p></li>

<li><p>As long as the feeling of accomplishment is excellent (especially if you keep your streak for 365 days), the burden you put on yourself by forcing a habit is even more critical. It can undermine the whole plan – keep in mind you are doing it for fun and profit, not because it is a punishment. If you have to take a break, take it.</p></li></ul>

<p>Build up your habits and more importantly use skills learned, otherwise there is no point of having a habit at all.</p>

		<p>Wit Sumathavanit has recently started to pivot from offline to online entrepreneurship. But before that, he tried to build a juice business in Bangkok.</p><p>We're here to talk about what went wrong with his approach, what were the lessons learned, and how those learnings impacted their process to validate new ideas.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
<img alt="Wit Sumathavanit" src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/bSE6FBmB_400x400.jpg">
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="can-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-your-background-and-what-are-you-currently-working-on">Can you tell us a bit about your background and what are you currently working on?</h3><p>I’m Wit and I’m based in Bangkok. I have a family business in the hospitality and travel industry. I'm on the corporate B2B side, which hasn't been doing much since the pandemic started. I turned myself into the digital business world, where I’m learning to get started with projects and see what happens.</p><p>My first idea was to have a digital marketing service for products, course creators, or any other companies that wanted to advertise. I connected them with newsletters because I believe that newsletters are under-monetized. There are many good newsletter creators out there who are working hard to build an audience, but they don't have a good monetization strategy. The great thing about newsletters is that they are very targeted. It's very powerful because is highly targeted compared to online ads on Facebook or Google. It's a win-win for advertisers to connect with audiences that are relevant to them.</p><p>I'm running a solo <a href="https://www.witwunder.com/">no-code agency</a> now. I'm a freelance for growth tools, database/spreadsheet, and automation.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-come-up-with-the-idea-to-build-your-juice-startup-what-was-the-motivation-behind-it">How did you come up with the idea to build your juice startup? What was the motivation behind it?</h3><p>After a long day of trying to get a ghost restaurant off the ground, my brain made the connection to something that might have untapped market potentials: Asian bitter melons. I tried a plain bitter melon drink and choked. It’s named “bitter melons” because they’re so darn bitter. It’s one of those foods that scientifically proven to lower blood sugar and a host of other health benefits.</p><p>A quick maths in my head revealed that tens of thousands of diabetics and those at-risk would have the need for daily doses of magic lower blood sugar juice. If only someone would be able to make a bitter melon juice that went from choke to death to barely drinkable, it will sell like crazy. I went all-in without validating the idea.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-build-it">How did you build it?</h3><p>It was almost all on the supply side. Thanks to the magic of e-commerce, I could do next-day home delivery of commercial-grade vertical cold press juicer and an excellent horizontal cold press juicer. I spent $2000 on shiny machines to extract natural goodness.</p><p>I spent the next 3 weeks googling juice combinations and recipes. Navigating the messy and inconvenient organic produce ecosystem of Bangkok. Most merchants of “organic produce” don’t know where their stuff comes from. I had sampled liters of fresh juice, which actually produced great results for my body. It was done. I came up with the secret commercial recipe that made bitter melon juice barely drinkable. That wasn’t enough, I came up with more recipes of health-boosting cold press juice. Ginger, turmeric, garlic, and white mugwort to name a few. Turns out those are also not needed because the market is not that big.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
<img alt="Bitter Melon Juice" src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/bittermelon-capsicum-1.jpg">
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The only way to get my juice to people was to use a delivery app. It turns out the cost of delivering juice is the same as the cost of the juice. I tried to package them as shot. They're very small because they're strong. The pricing doesn't work out because I cannot charge for them as a premium beverage. It's a physical business, the profit margin is not very high because you need manpower and you need to work with fresh ingredients.</p><h3 id="what-were-your-key-levers-to-start-growing-it">What were your key levers to start growing it?</h3><p>I sent samples to selected healthy juice enthusiasts, diabetic-risk people, health-conscious people. The results ranged from “This is actually OK” to “I’d rather not touch it ever again even for free”.</p><h3 id="what-were-the-biggest-challenges-you-had-to-overcome">What were the biggest challenges you had to overcome?</h3><p>To break-even, I needed to sell more than 500 bottles priced at Starbucks espresso. One person can only drink one 80 ml bottle per day. So, I needed to sell to 50 highly committed customers just to not make a loss.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
<img alt="Ginger Lime" src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/ginger-lime.jpg">
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="how-did-you-realize-the-project-was-not-going-in-the-right-direction">How did you realize the project was not going in the right direction?</h3><p>Once I got to the point of calculating how many bottles I had to sell until this became a profitable project. That’s when I decided to pull the plug on the experiment before it got more carried away. Watching interviews of long-standing juice businesses in the space revealed that people with $50,000+ worth of juice machines serving several hundreds of bottles daily are very passionate about juice. They began with sizeable volume from day 1 because they have been hobbyist juicers who have been documenting their juicing for years before doing it commercially. The juice community sees them as influencers. They had relationships with customers from day 0.</p><blockquote>If I pursue it further I would have a new hobby, but I don't see it as a business.</blockquote><h3 id="did-you-achieve-any-revenue-in-the-end-how-much-money-did-you-lose">Did you achieve any revenue? In the end, how much money did you lose?</h3><p>I made $300 and the cost of the equipment was around $3,000. If I went forward, labor and shipping would probably have been a lot worse than that. After all, I lost at least $3,000 for the project.</p><h3 id="if-you-had-the-chance-to-start-over-what-would-you-do-in-a-different-way">If you had the chance to start over, what would you do in a different way?</h3><p>I would try to make an MVP first. Set up a Facebook or Instagram page and see if they're interested in healthy juices with a strong taste. Reach out to diabetic communities to see if they have an interest in juices like the one I made. I would have known people would prefer taking their current medication rather than a juice too difficult to drink.</p><p>Instead of 3 weeks of mixing juice, I should have spent 3 weeks of market research on juice enthusiasts in Bangkok and validating my assumptions directly with diabetic potential customers.</p><h3 id="from-all-your-takeaways-you-learned-from-this-experience-what-advice-do-you-have-for-other-entrepreneurs-who-want-to-get-started-or-are-just-starting-out">From all your takeaways you learned from this experience, what advice do you have for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?</h3><p>My main takeaway is to have customers from day 0. Call it pre-launch audience building, content marketing, whatever. It’s about having relationships as early as possible and nurture them.</p><blockquote>Solutions do not equal demand. Just because a healthy option is available doesn’t mean that people will choose it.</blockquote><p>Make a landing page and see if there's the problem that I'm looking to solve. Many of my ideas will not make any revenue but my cost of starting is zero. I can try out ideas fast. If my ideas fail, it’s fine because I’m not attached to it. We're not the ones to decide if ideas are good or not, it’s the market.</p><p>Validate your idea. Put it out there and see what happens. If it doesn't work out is fine too, because a lot of successful people failed the first time.</p><h3 id="what-are-your-favorite-startup-resources-for-makers-and-entrepreneurs">What are your favorite startup resources for makers and entrepreneurs? </h3><p><a href="https://nocodemvp.com/">NoCodeMVP</a> made by <a href="https://twitter.com/bramk">Bram Kanstein</a>.

<![CDATA[We Put Together a List of the 20 Most Common Email Patterns in the B2B Space]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Almost any business that has an online presence and website will have numerous email addresses associated with them. Personal employee addresses, utility addresses, role based addresses, the list goes on. To put it simply, there is a mind boggling amount of email addresses that exist. If you have ever spent a decent amount of time visiting company websites or social media profiles, you might have noticed that many of these addresses share very similar qualities to completely unrelated addresses at completely unrelated businesses. The reason for this is that throughout a majority of the business to business (B2B) space, many companies have adopted very similar habits when creating email addresses for whatever purpose they need.</p><p>These patterns are commonly referred to as “Email Patterns” specifically, as there is a clear trend in what type of handles are used for specific purposes. Knowing what these handles are and what variants are the most common can be extremely useful to be aware of since knowing what possible patterns exist can allow you to potentially discover the email address of a specific contact or role based address at a company. Through trial and error paired with an email verification service, this potentially can allow you to make contact with the exact person you need to for whatever reason you may have.</p><p>In this article, we will be listing out the most common email patterns that exist online. To be as transparent as possible about the nature of this blog post, this information has been analyzed and extracted from the technology we utilize at <a href="https://companywell.co/">Companywell</a>. Considering that we crawl millions of web pages per day, alongside processing more than a million email addresses into our database, we have been able to break down which email patterns specific companies utilize, as well as be able to develop our own metrics based upon the extremely large dataset that we have accumulated through our efforts. Let’s explore our findings together.</p><h3 id="what-is-an-email-pattern">What Is An Email Pattern?</h3><p>To make sure that we are all on the same page before going over our data, let's explore what exactly an ‘email pattern’ is. An email pattern is essentially a manner in which an organization will consistently create email address handles in the same format. If a business hires a new employee and they need to create an email address for them, they will simply be able to create a handle for them that falls in line with other employees so that they are all consistently similar to each other. As an example, say a business hires somebody named John Doe. Depending on what patterns they utilize, they will simply just create a ‘john.doe@domain.com’ or a ‘j.doe@domain.com’ email address for them depending on what they have done in the past for employees.</p><p>A question you may be asking yourself is why would a majority of businesses follow the same type of guidelines when there is no real reason for doing so? To again put it as simply as possible, this usually tends to be the easiest solution for whatever department is responsible for creating and distributing these email addresses internally. Utilizing commonly used email patterns streamlines the process of creating new emails greatly, as you do not need to think about what to make a handle when the time comes. It also just makes internal communication much easier when an employee needs to communicate with another department or individual in the company, but has never been sent their email address. They can simply just follow the format and instantly connect with them without the need to look it up manually.</p><h3 id="the-most-common-email-patterns-in-the-b2b-space">The Most Common Email Patterns In The B2B Space</h3><p>Now that we are all on the same page, below we have listed out the 20 most common email patterns used in the B2B space.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>It’s not much of a surprise that many of these patterns appear to be essentially the same with a few variations. Almost every business within the B2B space wants an address to immediately be known as belonging to an individual within the company. The only differential factor in these 20 patterns is how they choose to differently represent them. Sometimes companies prefer just using abbreviations of names for accounts, others like to mix them up a bit based upon the name, others separate names in such a way that make it much more apparent at a glance what their name is.</p><h3 id="why-care-about-this">Why Care About This?</h3><p>To put it as bluntly as possible, this blog post should be utilized moreso as a resource to keep in your bookmarks if you ever need to figure out someone's email address at a business. Most likely (unless you are us), you will never need to find a contacts email address on a daily basis, but I am positive that there have been certain situations in your professional life where you needed to find someone's contact information and was unable to discover it online or managed to lose track of it over a certain period of time.</p><p>Since one of the most critical methods of communication within the B2B space is email, having this knowledge in the back of your mind can come in handy in a multitude of ways. Let's look into how you can utilize this information to its max potential in your career.</p><h3 id="how-to-utilize-this-information">How To Utilize This Information</h3><p>The primary manner in which to utilize these patterns is to use trial and error to guess at a desired contacts email address. There is a lot of use out of pulling peoples names out of their email address if they do not have a correctly configured footer that displays their information, but realistically this type of information you either have beforehand or can easily find by searching their email via Google. However, being able to guess at a contacts email address is an extremely useful tool to have up your sleeve as depending on the circumstance this can directly put you in contact with someone when you would otherwise have to reach out to them through other means such as <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://blog.companywell.co/p/d88412b7-2ee5-4359-beaa-cc72cb43382a/linkedin.com">Linkedin</a> (which is not a bad avenue but as many of us who are not dialed into our social media presence as often as we should be, these types of outreach efforts can be not seen or forgotten pretty easily).</p><p>Below I have outlined the manner in which I have personally utilized pattern recognition based email identification in the past. This workflow is by no means the only way you can utilize this info but this is what I have had the most success with in the past.</p><ol><li>Take the {first} and {last} of a contact you wish to reach</li><li>Get the domain of their current place of employment</li><li>Format this data into all 20 patterns (I.E a contact named ‘john doe’ you would take the first name ‘John’ and the last name ‘Doe’ and replace it in the patters as you would see in a common email format)</li><li>Utilize a verification service to see which pattern comes up as valid</li></ol><p>Unfortunately, this process does come with some caveats due to the existence of email servers configured as “catch all” inboxes, where any type of verification can be marked incorrectly due to these types of servers accepting any type of mail that gets sent to them (If you want some incite on which verification services perform the best, I have previously written an article where <a href="https://blog.companywell.co/the-best-email-verification-services-20-services-tested/">I have tested out 20 of the biggest verification services that you can check out here</a>). When you encounter any type of catchall server, unfortunately this workflow isn’t going to necessarily work. However, there is a workaround solution that can potentially allow you to still figure out the correct email address.</p><p>Below I have laid out what I do when I do encounter a Catch All server when attempting to find a specific contact email. I want to stress that you should only take the time to do this if the other workflow above does not work as intended based upon how the email server is configured.</p><ol><li>Take the {first} and {last} of a contact you wish to reach</li><li>Get the domain of their current place of employment</li><li>Format this data into all 20 patterns (I.E a contact named ‘john doe’ you would take the first name ‘John’ and the last name ‘Doe’ and replace it in the patters as you would see in a common email format)</li><li>Take each email address pattern you generated for this contact, then perform a google search of it wrapped up in quotation marks (I.E take a <a href="mailto:johndoe@domain.com">johndoe@domain.com</a> email address and perform a google search of “johndoe@domain.com”</li><li>Go through the first page of results and see if this email address comes up exactly as you typed it. Some Google results will show something similar or break off the handle and show you the name, but what you are looking for is an exact match to what pattern you searched.</li><li>If you cannot locate the email address on the page, move on and proceed to searching the next email address. If you can confirm that the exact email address is on a page and that its location makes sense to where it would be posted, than congratulations you most likely just located their email address.</li></ol><p>In general, I honestly do not suggest this method but I did want to put this process out there as I have successfully found and made contacts with individuals by performing this exact process, so maybe somebody out there can get use out of it like I have in the past. But aside from that, this is a process that takes up a lot of time and unfortunately, doesn’t yield the best results normally. But it can work for the right circumstances.</p><p>There are definitely other ways in which you can utilize this information to the betterment of your needs. Due to the nature of patterns and being able to utilize data sources like CRM’s or lists of contacts from …</p></section></div>

<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>3</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>Slowly but surely, Helicopter Money’s time is approaching and we better enjoy this experiment. The coronavirus pandemic, which is an absolute black-swan phenomenon, has forced governments and central banks to take measures that have a direct impact on the economy.</p>
<p>So, what could be more aggressive than distributing money to the public in order to keep the wheels of the economy turning? Is it the right time and what is the long term impact of this monetary policy?</p>
<h2><em><strong>First, What is Helicopter Money?</strong></em></h2>
<p>Helicopter money is a term coined by Milton Friedman and refers to a large sum of new&nbsp;money that is distributed to the public in order to stimulate the economy during a recession. In simple terms, when the economy is in a&nbsp;liquidity trap, Helicopter money is an unconventional monetary policy although, in the past two decades, it has been the standard policy of most developed countries worldwide.</p>
<h2><em><strong>How does Helicopter Money really work?</strong></em></h2>
<p>Well, obviously there is no ‘real’ helicopter that drops money from the sky but the term is being used as a metaphor for distributing funds to citizens. In reality, the funds will be automatically deposited in citizens’ bank accounts.</p>
<p>Nowadays, some economists propose that it’s time to use Helicopter money’ to stimulate the economy and more importantly, enable people to meet their basic needs.</p>
<p>This can be attributed to the alleged ‘success’ of central banks following the 2008 economic crisis that has strengthened the opinion of those who believe in government interventions, whether by monetary or fiscal policy. The Quantitative Easing (QE), which is a form of monetary policy in which a central bank purchases securities in order encourage lending and investment (or in other words, printing money), has been adopted by a number of central banks and is considered by many as the best solution for an economic recession.</p>
<h2><em><strong>Coronavirus and Helicopter Money – Can it work?</strong></em></h2>
<p>Fiscal interventions are a powerful tool but also extremely risky. Many countries have suffered from printing and distributing money to the public and thus, creating inflation and hyperinflation. Central banks have the ability to create money in the form of currency or provide credit to banks and businesses. But eventually, the United States is the only country in the world able to print U.S. dollars as its currency is used internationally and it would not significantly affect the value of the currency.</p>
<p>Essentially, governments have the power to print money, however, over-printing ends up cheapening the currency and may create even bigger problems that can end up with the worst scenario of the total valuelessness of the currency and the loss of the public confidence in the issuing government. This may be the doom scenario for the economic system as we know it and requires a restart of the whole system.</p>
<p>This does not come as a surprise. The risk of high inflation, high debts, and the loss of public confidence in the concept of money is out there and is highly possible. Since the coronavirus has entered our lives, many wonder about the concept of money and the economic cycle in general. Some also suggest a <strong><a href="https://www.allinallspace.com/coronavirus-is-it-the-right-time-to-stop-global-economy-and-financial-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">total shutdown of the global economy due to the coronavirus pandemic</a></strong>.</p>
<p>But measures to deal with the current crisis must be taken and so far, a limited number of countries have already made a first and second round of stimulus checks and this policy is expected to continue.</p>
<p>Ultimately, money is a man-made concept, which means we can do whatever we want. The free&nbsp;economy is a trial-and-error system where government, central banks, businesses, and individuals try different policies and methods to reach the ultimate system. The bizarre situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic can create a change in our global economic system. Perhaps the coronavirus pandemic can lead to full adoption of the <strong><a href="https://www.allinallspace.com/universal-basic-income-why-it-would-or-wouldnt-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Basic Income</a></strong> policy to ensure that people are able to meet their most essential needs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>When you feel low or fed up, itâ€™s tempting to shut down and do very little. You might cancel activities and social events, and choose passive options instead, such as staying in bed or watching TV. Itâ€™s easy to understand why this happens: when you feel down or depressed, even simple tasks take a lot of effort and energy. It can also be distressing if things arenâ€™t as enjoyable as they used to be.</p><p>Of course, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have had their activities and social events cancelled for them. For anyone experiencing depression or low mood, these restrictions will have compounded their desire to withdraw, and the prospect of coming out of lockdown might feel daunting. But, paradoxically, one of the most effective ways to improve a low mood is to do the very things you donâ€™t feel like doing.</p><p>In 1973, the American behavioural psychologist Charles Ferster <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0035605" target="_blank">noticed</a> that people who feel low tend to do less. In particular, they engage in fewer activities that bring them enjoyment or meaning. He argued that this drop in activity could be an important factor in understanding and treating depression. His observations provided the foundation for his behavioural model of depression, which still informs our understanding of the condition today.</p><p>According to behavioural approaches, depression is the result of a problematic cycle between reduced activity and low mood. The cycle begins when a person starts doing less, which means that they become more withdrawn and isolated. This, in turn, leads to fewer opportunities for positive experiences or distraction, exacerbating a personâ€™s low mood. This makes the person even less motivated to try effortful, interesting activities, and the cycle continues.</p><p>This negative cycle doesnâ€™t come out of nowhere; it often starts for a clear reason. The low mood seen in depression is often preceded by â€˜a big context shiftâ€™, says Dean McMillan, professor of clinical psychology at Hull York Medical School and the University of York. This shift is caused by a significant change in circumstances, such as a divorce, a demanding period at work â€“ or a global pandemic. The context shift means that the activities a person used to enjoy become difficult or impossible. For example, after a divorce, people might find it upsetting to go to places they used to enjoy with their partner, or a student under pressure at university might be too tired to try once-loved hobbies. Similarly, after the prolonged isolation and inactivity of lockdown, previously enjoyed routines might be challenging or unappealing.</p><p>The risk then is that people withdraw further. They choose easy but unrewarding behaviours instead, such as staying at home (even as lockdown is lifted or as new social opportunities arise). At first, this makes good sense. â€˜This withdrawal is driven by peopleâ€™s desire to avoid the negative emotions that theyâ€™re experiencing when they try to do these activities,â€™ according to David Richards, a professor of mental health services research at the University of Exeter. McMillan agrees, adding that this behaviour â€˜works in the immediate term because it makes you feel betterâ€™. The difficulty lies in what this inactivity sets up in the long term. The risk, he says, is that â€˜it moves you further from what you need to do to get something out of the worldâ€™.</p><p>The key to relieving depression, according to behavioural approaches, is to somehow break this cycle of inactivity and low mood. This is the main goal of the behavioural treatment that the American psychologist Peter Lewinsohn and his colleagues began developing in the 1960s. Today, this approach is known as behavioural activation (BA) and is well-established as an <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/looking-beyond-depression-a-metaanalysis-of-the-effect-of-behavioral-activation-on-depression-anxiety-and-activation/F4B92EAA32F7949A958A1147B6D5B480" target="_blank">effective</a> psychological therapy for depression.</p><p>In BA, people experiencing depression are gradually encouraged to engage in the very activities they have stopped doing. The idea is that the cycle of inactivity and low mood is replaced with a more beneficial cycle in which productive, meaningful activities make people feel better, which in turn increases motivation for more activity. One participant from a research <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782914000396" target="_blank">study</a> about BA described the process: â€˜I think [BA] helped me a lot because then I started to take care of some stuff and got it done. Just the happy feeling that you get when you have managed to accomplish your goal.â€™</p><p>BA is a standalone treatment, but its principles often appear in other forms of therapy, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). In fact, in one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27461440" target="_blank">study</a> comparing different types of therapy, BA was just as effective at reducing depression as full CBT. Although BA was originally developed as a therapist-led treatment, it involves simple principles that you can implement yourself to improve your mood.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Monitor what you do each day.</strong> The first step involves keeping a record of all your activities for about a week. There are free worksheets available <a href="https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/ActivityDiary.pdf" target="_blank">online</a>, but you can make one yourself. Draw up an empty timetable, splitting each day into hourly slots or into morning, afternoon and evening. Then, for a week, make a note of what you did each day. Critically, you should also make a note of how you felt during each activity, from 0 (feeling really down) to 10 (feeling positive and upbeat). For example, you might note that you watched TV in the morning and your mood was about a 3, then you did a yoga class in the afternoon and your mood was about a 5. â€˜The idea is that this step helps gather information about the small changes in behaviour that could make a big difference but that we often overlook,â€™ says Laura Pass, a clinical psychologist at the University of East Anglia.</p><p>If the idea of tracking your activities for a full week seems daunting, then you could do it for less time. â€˜The aim is to set the recording-activities step at a level that is manageable for the person,â€™ says Pass. â€˜So this might be doing one day, or doing a few time-points during the week.â€™ She stresses that this step can be tailored to the individual: â€˜For example, for a young person, a parent might help them complete this.â€™</p><p>If the idea of tracking your behaviour at all seems too hard, BA principles could still be useful to you â€“ just skip this step and go to the â€˜Make a planâ€™ step below. â€˜Personally, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s absolutely essential to do the baseline activity,â€™ Richards says. Pass agrees, emphasising that the key is about changing future behaviour. â€˜So if someone is able to do that without recording their activity, thatâ€™s still positive.â€™</p><p><strong>Evaluate what you did.</strong> If you tracked your activities and mood, then reflect on what you were doing when your mood was higher. It doesnâ€™t matter if your mood was never very high; thatâ€™s common, particularly if youâ€™ve had a prolonged period of feeling down or depressed. A small increase in mood is still helpful and will inform the next step.</p><p><strong>Make a plan for the following week.</strong> Now you need to schedule activities for the upcoming week, using the same blank worksheet as before. Look back at your diary from the previous week, and include in your schedule the activities you were doing when you experienced a slightly better mood. In addition, try to include some of the activities you have stopped doing, or are doing less often now. You donâ€™t need to fill out every slot, but aim to schedule at least one or two activities for each day.</p><p>To figure out the kind of things you should include, itâ€™s useful to think about not just what you enjoy but also what you find meaningful or important â€“ or what you used to, before this period of low mood or lockdown. â€˜The idea is to personally identify whatâ€™s important to you in your life,â€™ says Pass. â€˜Itâ€™s about where you want your life to be going.â€™ If you enjoy going out with friends, for example, you could invite someone to go for a coffee, or make plans to call a friend. If you value learning, you could plan to take a book out of the library or listen to a new podcast. There isnâ€™t a set list of activities youâ€™re supposed to try; schedules for a school-age teenager, a working parent and a pensioner might vary considerably. What matters to you will depend on your own unique circumstances.</p><p>There might be some less fun things in your schedule, too. If itâ€™s important for you to have a tidy house or flat, for example, you might want to schedule some cleaning or a clearout. McMillan emphasises that itâ€™s about finding a balance between three different types of activity: the pleasurable (such as seeing a friend), the routine (showering, cooking) and the necessary â€“ where the consequences of not doing an activity are significant (academic work, paying bills). â€˜It isnâ€™t just about doing nice things,â€™ he says. â€˜Itâ€™s just as important to get up and brush your teeth and have a bath. Itâ€™s about doing things that get you something positive in life.â€™</p><p>In your new schedule, avoid prolonged periods of not doing very much. In particular, be on the lookout for anything from the previous week that helped you to avoid or escape more fulfilling activity. For example, you might have stayed in bed late so you would miss a certain meeting at work, or spent hours scrolling through social media instead of going out with friends or chatting to them on Zoom. Even though these low-effort behaviours might feel appealing in the moment, they could be maintaining your low mood. This is because, when you do these activities, theyâ€™re filling up time that you could otherwise spend doing something positive. Doing very little at home or choosing to relax arenâ€™t problematic behaviours in and of themselves; they become problematic only if youâ€™re using them to avoid doing something more important. Try to spot any behaviours that you use to withdraw from the world, and avoid scheduling these for the following week.</p><p><strong>Stick to the plan, even when you donâ€™t feel like it.</strong> A key aspect of BA is that you need to carry out all your …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>Most product launchers have difficulties when entering the market with a new offering. Only 40% of new products reach target customers. 60% manage to bring some profit, <a href="https://learn.g2.com/product-launch-statistics">according to the Marketing Research Association</a>. With these statistics in mind, let's explain the go-to-market strategy to ease the founder's job.</p>

<h2>What is the go-to-market strategy?</h2>
<div><p>Go-to-market strategy (or GTM strategy) is a plan of how a product will reach its audience.</p><p>As a rule, it defines the following:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>What specific value a product provides (Why are you creating it?)</li>
<li>Who are you targeting (Who is your ideal customer?)</li>
<li>How do you attract new customers and make them your loyal users? (distribution model, channels, and success metrics)<p>Thus, we can illustrate it like this.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A go-to-market strategy is different from a business plan and a marketing strategy. Even though all three are critical for successful company growth, go-to-market has wider adoption. It also refers to launching a new service or entering a new market by an existing company.</p>

<h2>Why do you need a go-to-market strategy?</h2>
<p>As a startup, you plan your resources carefully to reduce risks. Resources include costs, time, and employees necessary to create and maintain your product.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>A GTM strategy may help you with it, serving as an action plan for a new product release. It assures that the offering meets the user's pain points, and has a proper distribution strategy. You can share it within your agency or with other stakeholders to ensure that everyone is on the same page.</p>

<h2>How to build a go-to-market strategy for startups?</h2>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Set your target audience and customer persona(s).</h3>
<p>Not everyone needs your product, and that is okay. What you need to know is the target audience benefitting the most from your offer. <a href="https://marketinginsidergroup.com/strategy/5-reasons-buyer-personas-arent-good-enough/f">A study reveals that 93% of agencies exceeding profit objectives use segmented customer personas</a>. You can study and segment your audience in several methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>direct customer interviewsÂ&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Having conversations with your target audience can bring you unexpected insights. Based on this, you can ask for references for further interviews and get more results.</p>
<ul>
<li>surveys &amp; questionnaires</li>
</ul>
<p>Anonymous surveys &amp; tools can help you reach a diverse audience and get to know their pain points.</p>
<ul>
<li>available industry reports by research agencies or public institutions;Â&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This method takes the fewest effort, but it gives no guarantee that the data will be relevant to your case.</p>

            <div>
                <div>
                    
    
<p>As you build up your customerâ€™s portrait, specify the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>demographics</li>
<li>geography</li>
<li>job position</li>
<li>psychographics</li>
<li>problems faced</li>
<li>behavior patterns</li>
<li>devices used</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://us.epsilon.com/pressroom/new-epsilon-research-indicates-80-of-consumers-are-more-likely-to-make-a-purchase-when-brands-offer-personalized-experiences">Epsilon reports that 80% of users are more inclined to purchase a product if a brand offers personalized user experience</a>. Thus, the more in-depth data you get about your customers, the easier it is to convert them with the right messaging. </p>
<p>Sometimes it takes more than one person to make a decision, especially if you are creating a B2B product. Harvard Business Review claims that on average <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/the-new-sales-imperative">6.8 people take part in B2B purchase decisions</a>. This prolongs and complicates the buying process. In this case, you have to know the goals, motivations, and role of every stakeholder involved. Adjust your messaging &amp; value proposition to answer customer needs and close more offers.</p>

<h2>2. Set your value proposition</h2>
<p>Now that you understand your target users, define the value you can offer to them. Instead of listing the product features, identify its benefits for customers.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do this with a three-column matrix, viewing how exact product features help to solve specific customer problems.</p>

<h2>3. How do you reach your users?</h2>
<p>Now you studied your target audience, created value propositions and messaging. It is time to plan the distribution.</p>
<p>Let's say you target real estate agents. These users may read Inman and Mashvisor to check industry news, but not use Facebook at all. When choosing a software tool, they compare the client's reviews and pricing. Thus, learn their behavior and choose your distribution channels accordingly. You can read industry reports, and follow best practices. Google Trends and Statista are efficient tools, to begin with.</p>
<p>Here are some of the distribution channels you may use:</p>
<ul>
<li>website &amp; blog</li>
<li>physical office</li>
<li>events &amp; webinars</li>
<li>partnerships with influencers</li>
<li>social media &amp; forums</li>
<li>product listings</li>
<li>Google Ads, LinkedIn ads, Facebook ads</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth testing your tactics and scaling on what works best for your product.</p>

<p>Make sure you have a clear strategy to follow. Marketing &amp; sales strategies should also align with your business goals and target customers. These are some of the digital marketing tactics you might consider for your product:</p>


                    
    
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Partnerships</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<div><p>They also refer to indirect selling. By leveraging the brands and public people trusted by your audience, you can grow your conversion rates. </p><p>For example, Anaplan launched a cloud financial planning solution through established partnerships. Through the well-planned referral program, the company expanded its market reach.</p><p><em>â€œThe customers are looking for a range of skills, and obviously Anaplan knows its products very well, but our partners bring so much more to the party. You hear a lot of people talking about change management and redesigning processes â€¦ - partners bring that and deep industry expertise,â€œ - Clarke, the CEO at Anaplan</em></p></div>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>


                    
    
<ul>
<li>
<h3>SEO (search engine optimization) &amp; content marketing</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Content &amp; SEO can help you nurture your cold audiences, turning them into your hot leads.</p>
<p>For example, a tax automation agency TaxJar benefited from content in its go-to-market strategy. Due to the lack of expert educational content, the company saw an opportunity. It built authority &amp; trust by creating evergreen content on sales taxing for its audience.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>â€œAnother opportunity for us was our ability to educate the world on sales tax. Therefore, we decided to build the best content we could to help people wrap their heads around sales tax, which feels like an insane problem changing all the time. </em><em><br></em><em><br></em><em>This also helped us succeed through word of mouth, which has been a tremendous lever for growth.â€� </em></p>
<p><em>TaxJar CEO</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Paid ad campaigns</strong></h3>
(Google Search and Media, Twitter Ads, Quora Ads, LinkedIn Ads)</li>
</ul>
<p>These can serve as a powerful enhancement for your content, reaching new customers.</p>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Public relations (PR)</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Press publications work best to build brand awareness and spread the word, like the Mashvisor or Inman resources cited above. They can also bring sales, with a combination of other methods.</p>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Email marketing</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This channel works best to convert problem-aware readers in your clients. By nurturing your subscribers with relevant &amp; up-to-date info, you can build trust and develop engaging relationships with subscribers.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backed by the industry data and your audience research, identify the<strong> inbound or outbound </strong>marketing methods you will use. Donâ€™t make such decisions based on guesses, as this may lead to inefficient investments and lost time.</p>


                    
    
<h2><strong>5. Plan your budget, time &amp; resources</strong></h2>
<p>Specify the amount of time &amp; money you are going to spend on each tactic. Itâ€™s advisable to spend at least 3-4 weeks to test every distribution channel. After this time, you can analyze the first results and scale what works best.Â&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>It’s hard to believe that its been more than 3 years since I opened <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2000">RFC 2000</a>, which defined
the const generics for Rust. At the same time, reading the RFC thread, there’s also been a huge
amount of change in this area: for one thing, at the time the RFC was written, const fns weren’t
stable, and consts weren’t even being evaluated using miri yet. There’s been a lot of work over the
years on the const generics feature, but still nothing has shipped. However, I think we have defined
a very useful subset of const generics which is stable enough to ship in the near term.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, <strong>const generics</strong> refers to generics that are constant values, rather
than types. This allows types to be parameterized by, for example, specific integer values. In
stable Rust, only the special array type - <code>[T; N]</code> - has a const parameter (the length of the
array), and there is no way to be abstract over all values of <code>N</code>, even for arrays. Const generics
will allow creating new types parameterized by values, as well as implementing traits and functions
that are abstract over those values. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// This is a custom type which is parameterized by a `usize`
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>N</span>: <span>usize</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> 
</span><span>    </span><span>bytes</span>: <span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span>],</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>// This is a trait which has been implemented for arrays of
</span><span>// any length.
</span><span></span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span>: <span>Debug</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>N</span>: <span>usize</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Debug</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>We’ve been using the const generics feature to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html#implementations">implement traits for arrays</a> for over a
year, artificially limiting the implementations to arrays of length 32. We are planning to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74060">lift
that limitation on those impls</a> in an upcoming release. By stabilizing const
generics, we could start to allow external crates to implement traits for all arrays as well, and
many other interesting use cases. There will be two important limitations, however.</p>
<h2 id="only-integral-primitive-types-for-const-generics">Only integral primitive types for const generics</h2>
<p>The initial types that a const generic can have will be limited to the integral primitive types.
That means the signed and unsigned integer types, booleans, and chars. For now, no compound or
user-defined types will be allowed, and no references (meaning no strings as well). This is a
relatively easy shortcoming of the current implementation to fix, and user defined types for const
generics will be possible in the nearer, rather than longer term.</p>
<p>I want to mention, since a lot of people aren’t aware of this, that not <em>any</em> type can be used as a
const parameter, even setting aside the current limitations of rustc. Importantly, in order for
Rust’s type system to be sound, equality between two types must be deterministic, reflexive,
symmetric, and so on. That is, if your custom type implements equality by flipping a coin, two
values of that type will sometimes be equal to one another and sometimes not. This will mean, two
types parameterized by those values will sometimes be the same type and sometimes a different type.
This would be quite troubling for the type system.</p>
<p>(As a concrete example, floating point numbers present challenges with the fact that <code>Foo&lt;NaN&gt;</code>, for
example, would not be considered the same type as itself, because <code>NaN</code> is not equal to itself.)</p>
<p>The long term solution to this is a notion of “structural equality,” which is a strictly correct
subset of <code>Eq</code> types that meet the properties needed for use in the type system. Rust already uses
this structural equality property when implementing matching. If you derive Eq and PartialEq for
your type and all its members, it should meet the structural equality property needed to be used in
matches and const generics.</p>
<h2 id="no-complex-expressions-based-on-generic-types-or-consts">No complex expressions based on generic types or consts</h2>
<p>The other limitation will be that only two kinds of expressions can be used to fill in a const
generic position:</p>
<ol>
<li>A const generic parameter. For example, in an <code>impl&lt;const N: usize&gt;</code>, where an const generic has
been introduced, that value can be used literally to fill a const generic.</li>
<li>An expression that can be used in a const context which does not depend on any type or const
parameters. This means literals, math equations, using consts, calling const fns, etc, as long
as no free generics are involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>This limits a lot of the more exotic and interesting things users want to do with const generics.
You can’t, for example, combine two array lengths together to form an array with type
<code>[T; N + M]</code>, or even double an array length with <code>[T; N * 2]</code>. You basically can’t have a type
that depends on computation that depends on other generics. Implementing this behavior soundly and
correctly is really the hard part of implementing const generics, and while work is ongoing, it
isn’t ready yet.</p>
<p>This also means that const generics can’t be filled in based on associated types, associated consts,
or generic methods. No functions that return <code>[u8; mem::size_of::&lt;T&gt;()]</code>, no use of <code>Self</code> like
<code>[u8; Self::LEN]</code>, etc.</p>
<p>This will mean, for example, that use cases like cryptographic hash traits which allow each
implementation to specify a different length for the hash they output will still be out of scope for
the MVP. This is a shame, but this feature will come eventually.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-be-able-to-do">What you <em>will</em> be able to do</h2>
<p>All of these restrictions might sound like the feature is pretty limited, but I think users will
find a lot of really powerful use cases for it once they can play around with it. For one thing,
traits that today might be implemented only by some array types, or not at all, will begin to be
implemented by all arrays, making arrays a much more first class part of the language. And <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74373">we’re
already finding awesome use cases</a>. Look at this code sample.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve worked out what we could stabilize in the near future, I am working up hype and
consensus aroud the vision of stabilizing this feature - that’s what this blog post is for! The next
steps will be for someone to carve out a feature gate which is this limited set of const generics
(as opposed to the existing whole <code>const_generics</code> feature gate) and then for us to go through the
standard procedure for documenting and stabilizing that feature gate.</p>
<h2 id="credit">Credit</h2>
<p>My own involvement in const generics between the RFC and now has been minimal to non-existent.
Essentially, my role (both in the RFC and now) has been to identify a scope we can get consensus on
moving forward with. However, the hard work of implementing const generics has been going on for
years in between then, and I want to credit especially the contributors <a href="http://github.com/eddyb">eddyb</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/varkor">varkor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lcnr">lcnr</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oli-obk">oli-obk</a> for their work on implementing this highly
requested feature.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>It has been said that there are two things hard in software development,
naming things and cache invalidation (while some add off-by-one errors
to the mix).
I believe that keeping the cache in sync with the source of truth might
count as a third one.
In this post, I'd like to tackle this issue, describe the ideal
situation -
1 cache, 1 datastore, describe the problem of having multiple components
that can write to the datastore, list all possible solutions, and
describe one elegant solution based on Change Data Capture and Jet.</p>
<h2>The ideal design</h2>
<p>In a system, to improve performance, one of the first short-term
measures is to set up a cache.
It's a tradeoff between getting the data faster at the cost of the data
being not that fresh: one loads the data in-memory close to the
consumer, and presto, one gets an instant performance boost. In regard
to a database, this is akin to the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-07-16-starting-architecture.svg" alt="Starting architecture"></p>
<p>In this read-through design, when the app requires an item, the cache
first checks whether it has it.
If yes, it returns it.
If not, it fetches it from the underlying Relational Database Management
System, stores it, and returns it.
For a write, it stores it, and also calls the RDBMS to store it.</p>
<p>Note that using a cache-aside design instead of read-through would have
the same issue.
The only difference would be the fact that the app would be responsible
for the fetching/storing logic instead of the cache.</p>
<p>The RDBMS is the sole source of truth - as it should be. Since the cache
intercepts write statements to the RDBMS, it's a mirror of the data.</p>
<h2>Handling third-party database updates</h2>
<p>This design works as expected until the database receives updates from
another source:</p>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-07-16-updating-database-bypassing-cache.svg" alt="Updating the database while bypassing the
cache"></p>
<p>Now, the RDBMS is still the source of truth, but the cache is not aware
of changes made by other components.
Hence, it might (will) return data that it has stored, but that is stale
compared to what is the source of truth in the RDBMS.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to cope with this issue.</p>
<h3>Cache invalidation</h3>
<p>Since the cache only queries the RDBMS if it doesn't store the requested
item, let's remove items after a specific time.
This is a built-in feature in enterprise-grade caches such as Hazelcast
IMDG, and it is known as the Time-To-Live.
When an item is stored, a TTL can be attached to it.
After that time has elapsed, the item is removed from the cache, and it
will be fetched from the RDBMS again if needed.</p>
<p>This approach has a couple of downsides:</p>
<ol>
<li>If an item is not updated in the RDBMS, but is evicted from the
cache, then there's an extra query from the cache to the RDBMS when it's
needed by the app.
This is a net loss of resources.</li>
<li>If an item is updated in the RDBMS, but its TTL has not been reached
yet, then the cache will return the stale data.
This defeats the purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>With longer TTL, we avoid unnecessary round trips but return more stale
data.
With shorter TTL, we waste resources with lesser chances of stale data.</p>
<h3>Polling the RDBMS</h3>
<p>Because the TTL doesn't seem to be the right approach, we could devise a
dedicated component that watches the RDBMS by regularly sending queries
to it and updating the cache accordingly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this strategy incurs the same issues as cache
invalidation:
the more frequent the queries, the more chances to catch changes, but
the more resources are wasted.
Worse, this also will put extra load on the RDBMS.</p>
<h3>RDBMS triggers</h3>
<p>A common downside of the above approaches is the way they both poll the
database.
Polling happens with a specific frequency, while writes don't follow any
regular periodicity.
Thus, it's not possible to make the two match.</p>
<p>Instead of polling, it would make much more sense to be event-driven:</p>
<ol>
<li>if no writes happen, there's no need to update the cache</li>
<li>if a write happens, then the relevant cache item should be updated
accordingly</li>
</ol>
<p>In RDBMS, this event-driven approach is implemented via <em>triggers</em>.
Triggers are dedicated stored procedures that are launched in response
to specific events, such as an <code>INSERT</code> or an <code>UPDATE</code>.</p>
<p>That works pretty well when the acted-upon object is inside the database
<em>e.g.</em> "when a record of table A is updated, then add a record to table
B".
For our use-case, where the acted-upon object is the cache, which sits
outside the database, it's not as simple.
For example, MySQL allows you to <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/faqs-triggers.html#faq-mysql-can-triggers-udf">make an external system call from a
trigger</a>.
However, this approach is very implementation-dependent and makes the
overall design of the system much more fragile.
Also, only some RDBMS implement triggers. Even if they do, there's no
standard implementation.</p>
<h2>Change Data Capture</h2>
<p>Wikipedia defines Change Data Capture (or CDC) as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] a set of software design patterns used to determine and track
the data that has changed so that action can be taken using the
changed data.</p>
<p>CDC is an approach to data integration that is based on the
identification, capture and delivery of the changes made to enterprise
data sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, CDC is a tool that allows to transform standard write
queries into events.
It implements it by "turning the database inside-out" (quote from Martin
Kleppmann).
This definition is because a database keeps a record of all changes in
an implementation-dependent append-only log.
Regularly, it uses it to manage its state. Some RDBMS also have other
usage <em>e.g.</em> MySQL uses the log for replication across nodes.</p>
<p>For example, here's a sample for MySQL binlog:</p>
<pre><code>### UPDATE `test`.`t`
### WHERE
###   @1=1 /* INT meta=0 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @2='apple' /* VARSTRING(20) meta=20 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @3=NULL /* VARSTRING(20) meta=0 nullable=1 is_null=1 */
### SET
###   @1=1 /* INT meta=0 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @2='pear' /* VARSTRING(20) meta=20 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @3='2009:01:01' /* DATE meta=0 nullable=1 is_null=0 */
# at 569
#150112 21:40:14 server id 1  end_log_pos 617 CRC32 0xf134ad89
#Table_map: `test`.`t` mapped to number 251
# at 617
#150112 21:40:14 server id 1  end_log_pos 665 CRC32 0x87047106
#Delete_rows: table id 251 flags: STMT_END_F
</code></pre>
<p>A CDC component connects to this immutable log to extract change events.</p>
<p>One can view CDC as the opposite of Event Sourcing:
the latter captures state by aggregating events, while the former
extracts events "from the state".</p>
<h2>Debezium</h2>
<p>CDC is quite recent, and hasn't had time to mature.
As such, there's no universal standard, but specific tools.
In this section, we are going to have a look at
<a href="https://debezium.io/">Debezium</a>.
Debezium is an Open Source set of services for CDC provided by Red Hat.</p>
<p>Debezium is an umbrella term covering several components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Debezium Connectors are specific bridges that read the append-only
proprietary log for each supported database.
For example, there’s a connector for MySQL, one for MongoDB, one for
PostgreSQL, etc.</li>
<li>Each connector is also a Kafka Connect Source Connector:
this allows to easily output CDC events to one’s Kafka cluster</li>
<li>Finally, the Debezium Engine is a JAR that allows Debezium to be
embedded in one’s applications.
Note that even in that case, Debezium produces Kafka Connect-specific
content, which then needs to be handled and transformed in one’s
application.</li>
</ol>
<p>While Kafka is a great technology, and probably also quite widespread
nowadays, data in Kafka needs to be persisted to disk.
The benefit of persistence is that data survive even in the event of the
cluster going down.
The tradeoff, however, is that the access time of disk-persisted data is
one (or 2) orders of magnitude slower than the access time of in-memory
data, depending on the underlying disk technology.</p>
<h2>Hazelcast Jet</h2>
<p><a href="https://jet-start.sh/">Hazelcast Jet</a> is a distributed stream
processing framework built on Hazelcast and combines a cache with
fault-tolerant data processing.
It has sources and sinks to integrate with several file, messaging and
database systems (such as Amazon S3, Kafka, message brokers and
relational databases).</p>
<p>Jet also provides a Debezium module where it can process change events
directly from the database, and write them to its distributed key-value
store.
This avoids having to write the intermediate messages to Kafka and then
read again to be written to a separate cache.</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>It’s (finally!) time to assemble all the previous bits together.
Here are the components and their responsibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>A MySQL database instance is where the data is stored.
It’s accessed in read-only mode by the cache, and in write-only mode by
some external component</li>
<li>A Jet instance reads events to MySQL through the Debezium connector,
transforms them into cache-compatible key-value pairs, and updates the
cache accordingly.
Note that while Jet pipelines provide filtering capabilities, it’s also
possible to filter items in the CDC connector to optimize load of the
pipeline</li>
<li>The app uses the cache, which is always up-to-date with the database,
give or take the time it takes for the above to execute</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-07-16-architecture-with-cdc.svg" alt="Final architecture with
CDC"></p>
<p>Note that this architecture assumes one starts from a legacy state, with
an existing app that uses caching, where later on a new component was
set up that could update the database.</p>
<p>If one starts from scratch, it’s possible to simplify the above diagram
(and associated code) as Jet embeds its own Hazelcast instance.
In that case, instead of Jet being a client of a third-party Hazelcast
instance, Jet is the one to configure and start the instance.
Obviously, it also can then get/put data.</p>
<h2>Talk is cheap, show me the code</h2>
<p>Sources for this post are available <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast-demos/evergreen-cache">on
GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The repository is made of the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>app</code> is a Spring Boot application using Spring Data JDBC to access a
MySQL database.
It abstracts away Hazelcast by using a Spring Cache layer</li>
<li><code>update</code> is a Spring Shell application.
It allows to update the data inside the database, with the cache none
the wiser</li>
<li><code>pipeline</code> is the Jet pipeline that listens to CDC events and update
the cache when data is updated</li>
</ul>
<p>The pipeline definition is quite straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>pipeline<span>.</span><span>readFrom</span><span>(</span>source<span>)</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Medium was beautiful when it first launched. The <span>WYSIWYG</span> editor blew my mind. Ads didn’t cover the first three paragraphs. It’s where all the cool kids published.</p>
<p>Reading an article on Medium felt like getting an email from an @gmail.com address in 2004. <em><span></span><span>“</span>This person must know what’s up, they’re on Medium!”</em></p>
<p>The content was great. There were fantastic Federal Reserve breakdowns and Apple iPhone hot takes.</p>
<p>But when I land on Medium posts now, I find myself discounting the articles before I even read them. Perhaps it’s that every article has the same little M in the top left, the same h1 size and font and color, the same you’ve-reached-your-reading-limit pop-up. Perhaps it’s the fact that Jeff Bezos’ dick pic post lives next to JavaScript framework flamewars. Whatever the case, Medium’s layout no longer magnifies an aura of<span></span> <span>“</span>expertness” for its authors.</p>
<p>Substack feels a lot like Medium’s early days. It’s great they’ve made newslettering easy. I love reading blogs. But as the number of Twitter bios with Substack subdomains grows, my eagerness to click through is shrinking.</p>
<p>The problem is twofold.</p>
<p>First, there’s a signal problem.</p>
<p>Medium used to amplify credibility. Now I find the opposite to be true for me. <em><span></span><span>“</span>Oh this person just throws stuff on Medium? Probably not worth my time.”</em> X-out.</p>
<p>Second, there’s a visual memory problem.</p>
<p>I’m a sucker for unique <span>CSS</span>. As pretentious as that sounds, it’s not a conscious judgment. Daring Fireball’s grey background is soothing. The big green Marginal Revolution monster is endearing. It’s easy to find Paul Graham’s article in my tabs: it’s the only Yahooo! favicon.</p>
<p>Substack’s (and Medium’s) locked layouts mean I look past the author, read the post, and then move on. It’s similar to Spotify’s Discover Weekly. Despite listening to the playlist on repeat, I can’t name a single artist from it.</p>
<p>People who already have a huge audience will likely succeed massively with Substack. The experience is easy. It’s thoughtful. It’s simple. Lowering the bar for online publishing is fantastic. I am cheering for them.</p>
<p>But I hope I don’t find myself groaning when I click on Substack links.</p>
<p>Medium became a victim of its own success. Too much noise, not enough signal. I wonder how Substack can avoid the same fate.</p>

I'm Daniel Bryant. I'd like to welcome you to the Ambassador Livin' on the Edge Podcast, the show that focuses on all things related to cloud-native platforms, creating effective developer workflows, and building modern APIs. Today I'm joined by Dave Sudia, senior DevOps engineer at GoSpotCheck.</p><p>Daniel (00:18):</p><p>I've been following Dave's work for the past couple of years. I was lucky enough to get to see in person his presentation with colleague, Toni Rib, at KubeCon San Diego last year, where they focused on the GoSpotCheck move from Heroku onto Kubernetes. After the presentation, Dave dropped by the Datawire booth. My colleague Rafi and I had a great chat with him. He clearly understood both the theory and the practicality of building a platform for an organization that is constantly evolving. Rafi and I learned a bunch.</p><p>Daniel (00:42):</p><p>Today we're talking about how Dave and his team at GoSpotCheck have focused on enabling engineers to develop apps effectively in a local development environment, assembling a PaaS-like Kubernetes platform with open-source components, particularly CNCF components, and enabling self-service around the bigger picture of API contract testing, infrastructure provisioning and deployment. Hello, Dave, and welcome to the Livin' on the Edge Podcast. Thanks for joining us today.</p><p>Dave (01:03):</p><p>Thanks for having me.</p><p>Daniel (01:04):</p><p>Could you briefly introduce yourself for the listeners and share a recent career highlight as well, please?</p><p>Dave (01:09):</p><p>Yeah. I'm Dave Sudia. I'm a senior DevOps engineer at GoSpotCheck. We're a startup based in Denver, Colorado. I think the career highlight was being on Deserted Island DevOps conference that happened in Animal Crossing a couple months ago.</p><p>Daniel (01:24):</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>Dave (01:25):</p><p>I don't know that I'm ever going to top that. That was super fun. It was put together by Austin Parker, who's in dev relations at LightStep. We went to his island in Animal Crossing and he had this crazy open broadcast studio set up, where we were talking in Zoom and he overlaid our audio onto the capture from his Switch, so you could watch us presenting in Animal Crossing. If you haven't seen it, I'll send you a link. It was just the most fun, wacky, thing. It was great.</p><p>Daniel (01:53):</p><p>Fantastic. You and I chatted quite a bit in San Diego last year at KubeCon, where you presented with your colleague, Toni Rib, Balancing Power and Pain: Moving a Startup From a PaaS to Kubernetes. I learned a bunch from that talk. Fantastic talk. We then caught up on the InfoQ Podcast and went a bit deeper into those topics. I'm guessing today really is part three of our discussion, but I was thinking for today, it'd be good to set a context for listeners of the GoSpotCheck platform, but then dive a bit more into the evolution of the platform, because I think you famously said you were assembling components versus building a platform, they're very different things, which I agree with. I think you've got some really great insight there.</p><p>Daniel (02:28):</p><p>Just to set the context, was running the GoSpotCheck app on a PaaS a good experience in the early years?</p><p>Dave (02:36):</p><p>Yeah. To recap, we started on Heroku. We ran there for many years. We were one of their largest customers by the time we started moving off. Their product is great. There are many things that we still miss about their product that we're now trying to rebuild internally. That is where I think most people should start, whether it's App Engine or Beanstalk or Heroku or any of those other more PaaS-type offerings. I think the thing I said in the last one is when you start there, you don't need my team. That's where your money is going, you're saving that economy of having to have a bunch of people who really understand how operations work. But at a certain point, you're going to get to a point where you need someone who really understands how operations work. You need features that aren't being offered by those platforms. Then you got to move.</p><p>Dave (03:29):</p><p>We shifted to Google Kubernetes engine as the primary place our apps landed, but what you lose is a lot of the sugar of a platform as a service. You lose the ease and the convenience. Last November, we had a hackathon. One of our lead developers, who runs a team, came up and said, "I don't really know exactly what I'm going to be doing for this hackathon, but it's going to be making this easier. This is all too hard." I heard that loud and clear. Making Kubernetes Easier was Bryan Liles' keynote at KubeCon last year. It’s not like it's going to get fixed in a hackathon.</p><p>Dave (04:13):</p><p>That's our push this year. We glued a bunch of tools together. How do we turn them into a more cohesive experience? It's never going to provide the convenience of git push Heroku master for a number of reasons, but how do we provide something that is just better, a little more seamless, a little easier to use?</p><p>Daniel (04:32):</p><p>Nice. Just take a step back. Initially the reason you looked at moving off Heroku was purely scale, I think, wasn't it?</p><p>Dave (04:39):</p><p>Yeah. It was scale and because of scale, feature. One of the big drivers was we used all their postgres instances and we just got to a point where the way that our queries were running, the performance characteristics of their databases just could not keep up with what we needed. We needed to shift our databases off. Then it was a cost perspective. When you're paying for my team, you shouldn't also be paying for Heroku. Then you're spending way too much.</p><p>Daniel (05:10):</p><p>Makes total sense. You mentioned assembling the …</p></div></main></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

        

        

<p>I recently needed to clear a large amount of space on my Mac's hard drive in
order to install Windows through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_Camp_(software)">Boot
Camp</a>. After deleting files
and applications, I still had large amounts of space taken up in ways that I
didn't understand. Here is what I did to fix the problem.</p>
<h2 id="easy-methods">Easy Methods<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#easy-methods"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>The obvious thing to start with was deleting known files and applications. In
particular, I removed some built-in macOS applications, like GarageBand, that I
can always re-download from the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>I also cleared the trash. As a tip, you probably want to set it to
<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/delete-files-and-folders-on-mac-mchlp1093/mac">automatically delete items after 30
days</a>.
I don't understand why that's considered an advanced feature in Finder when it
seems like it should be the default setting. It <a href="https://osxdaily.com/2017/02/10/automatically-empty-trash-mac/">wasn't even an
option</a> until
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Sierra">Sierra</a>.</p>
<p>Then I went into my Google Backup and Sync (for <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google
Drive</a>) settings and <a href="https://www.remosoftware.com/info/how-to-configure-google-drive-sync-settings-to-sync-specific-folders-or-file-types">unsynced some
folders</a>
that I don't need to be available locally.</p>
<h2 id="other-storage">Other Storage<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#other-storage"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>After those easy wins, I wanted to get a better idea of what was taking up
space. macOS has a built in storage analyzer, but it's pretty basic. The
overview gives a rough breakdown.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZbajDJM.png" alt="macOS storage overview"></p>
<p>Clicking manage gives you a more detailed view.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jl509hi.png" alt="macOS storage management"></p>
<p>But note that “System” is greyed out! There's no way to drill down into it to
see what's actually taking up space.</p>
<p>This was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Mojave">Mojave</a>.  At least
<a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/">Catalina</a> splits it up into “System” and
“Other,” though you still can't drill down into either.</p>
<h2 id="disk-space-analysis-programs">Disk Space Analysis Programs<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#disk-space-analysis-programs"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>I'm familiar with using <code>du -sh</code> in the terminal to show folder sizes, but I
thought a GUI program might be better for this task. I looked into third party
programs to find out what folders and files were taking up space. The first one
I tried was <a href="http://www.derlien.com/">Disk Inventory X</a>.</p>
<p>It was useful but took a while (around 10 minutes) to produce results.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VW6aebM.png" alt="Disk Inventory X results"></p>
<p>I looked into alternatives. The most helpful resources were this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/81568/275342">Stack Exchange
question</a> and this
<a href="https://macpaw.com/how-to/best-disk-space-analyzers-mac">article</a>.</p>
<p>I tried <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/more">OmniDiskSweeper</a>. It doesn't have a
tree view like Disk Inventory X does, but I didn't find that very useful anyway.
OmniDiskSweeper was able to show results as they came, rather than all at once
at the end.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/t9N8zcf.png" alt="OmniDiskSweeper results"></p>
<p>It doesn't update in real time, so I did have to re-analyze the disk after
deleting files.</p>
<h2 id="docker">Docker<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#docker"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed was Docker's <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/space/">disk image
file</a>. Docker for Mac stores
containers and images in that single, large file. I ran <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/">docker system
prune</a> to
delete unnecessary containers and images.</p>
<p>Then I decreased the size limit for the disk image file.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FNrnAtf.png" alt="Docker disk image size"></p>
<h2 id="spotify">Spotify<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#spotify"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>The biggest surprise to me was discovering that Spotify can take a large amount
of space to cache files. Mine was over 6 GB. Even Firefox's cache was only 2 GB.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4oUnYL7.png" alt="Spotify cache size"></p>
<p>Furthermore, there doesn't seem to be a way to control this cache size in
Spotify settings, not even buried in some advanced settings. This setting <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Social/What-happened-to-the-cache-limit-setting-on-Mac-desktop-player/td-p/4658524">might
have existed
before</a>,
but it doesn't now. Luckily, <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Mac/How-to-limit-cache-size/td-p/2907725">someone
discovered</a>
that you can set a limit manually by editing the Spotify preferences file at
<code>~/Library/Application\ Support/Spotify/prefs</code> and adding a line like
<code>storage.size=2048</code>.</p>
<p>I set the limit to 2048 MB, restarted Spotify, and confirmed that the cache
folder dropped to the expected size, saving me over 4 GB.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ du -sh ~/Library/Caches/com.spotify.client/Data
6.4G    Data

<span># restart Spotify</span>

$ du -sh ~/Library/Caches/com.spotify.client/Data
2.0G    Data
</code></pre></div><h2 id="yarn">Yarn<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#yarn"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> seemed to have old cache folders.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ cd ~/Library/Caches/Yarn <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ls
v2 v4 v6

$ du -sh v2 v4 v6
  0B    v2
1.2G    v4
1.2G    v6

$ yarn cache dir
/Users/dguo/Library/Caches/Yarn/v6
</code></pre></div><p>I deleted the v2 and v4 folders. My cache is fairly small, but <a href="https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6037">other
people</a> have ended up with gigantic
caches.</p>
<h2 id="git">Git<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#git"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>I found some <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repositories that I didn't need
anymore. Deleting these saved around 1 GB in total. Git repos can take up a
large amount of space since by default, they contain the entire history of a
project. Though in my case, most of the space savings was due to deleting
<code>node_modules</code> with each one.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#conclusion"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>For years, I've used <a href="https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/">AppCleaner</a> to
uninstall applications because I knew most of them leave files behind if you
only delete the application itself. This experience reminded me that when I
install an application, I generally have no idea where it's going to write files
and how large they can get. It would be nice if operating systems could make it
easier for users to be more in control of hard drive usage, instead of letting
applications treat the hard drive like an unlimited resource.</p>

People can vote on different features so we know what’s most important for them. It’s easier for us to decide what to build if a lot of our users want something. Keep in mind though that in order to grow you have to do 3 things. Acquire more users, keep your current users happy (don’t let them churn) and expand the revenue from your current users.</p><p>We’re pretty good at attracting new users. Our growth rate has been 20% – 30% month over month in number of new users. June was actually the first month where new user growth was below 30%. July should be above 30% again.</p><p>Our revenue hasn’t grown by those numbers for one important reason: our churn rate is too high. We’re currently at about 10% churn rate. That’s too much.</p><p>We could focus on new features our current users want but that won’t stop the churn. People don’t leave because there’s something missing from a feature. People leave because their needs aren’t met. We’re not providing the AHA moment soon enough and we’re not helping them enough with their “Jobs to be done”.</p><p>We’re now focussing on getting people to that AHA / Magic moment sooner and sooner. We have a pretty good idea what that magic moment is although I think you can always improve and create new magic moments in your app.</p><p>The other lever you can pull is the new user lever. Making incremental changes to existing features won’t pull in new users. You’ll make your current users happy, yes.

She told me she welcomed the diagnosis of a neurobiological disorder, which confirmed her problem was â€˜realâ€™ â€“ brought on by a physiological force external to her volition â€“ and that it showed sheâ€™s not â€˜just a slackerâ€™.</p><p>At the same time, Jenna was careful to distance her experience from that of people who are, in her words, â€˜crazyâ€™ or â€˜nutsâ€™. Their illness means a loss of control and ability to function. By contrast, she sees her problem as a common and minor glitch in neurochemistry. No one, she insisted, should mistake her for the mentally ill.</p><p>Jenna was one of 80 diverse volunteers that a research team at the University of Virginia and I interviewed in Chicago, Baltimore, Boston and two small cities in central Virginia. We wanted to find out how people deal with common forms of psychological distress and challenging circumstances, such as: shyness and nervousness in social situations; underperformance at work or school; struggles after the loss of a significant relationship; and disappointment with how their lives are unfolding. A majority of our interviewees had received some form of psychotherapy and/or been diagnosed with a condition such as depression, social anxiety disorder or attention deficit disorder, and prescribed a psychiatric medication.</p><p>It was striking that many (though not all) at least partly explained their distress in terms of biological causes, particularly a neurochemical imbalance. Yet thinking of their problems in this way was a fraught process. Like Jenna, many interviewees sharply distinguished themselves from the mentally ill and cast the mentally ill in a very negative light. This stigmatising of people with serious mental illness wasnâ€™t based on any first-hand experiences; rather, it was motivated by a desire to protect their own dignity and social standing. To justify the distinction between their own situation and mental illness, our interviewees rejected the idea that they had an â€˜illnessâ€™ as such, detached themselves from any formal diagnosis using statements such as â€˜thatâ€™s what the doctor calls itâ€™ or, in some cases, they avoided seeking medical help altogether.</p><p>For people like Jenna, who embraced a neurobiological explanation for their problems, this created a conundrum, which many of them resolved by creating a separate classification for their own experience â€“ what I have called a â€˜third conditionâ€™. The people we spoke to did not give this â€˜conditionâ€™ a name or explicit meaning. Rather it emerged in the rhetorical space opened up by the way they framed their personal struggle, distinguishing it from mental illness, on the one hand, and normality, on the other.</p><p><strong>Consider the perspective</strong> of another of our interviewees, a young woman Iâ€™ll call Piper, who had been diagnosed with depression. When â€˜you think mental illnessâ€™, according to Piper, â€˜you think schizophrenia and crazy people, and Iâ€™m not crazy, I just get really nervous.â€™ In making this distinction, interviewees like Piper and Jenna not only claimed that they were less impaired than the seriously mentally ill, they also insisted that their experience was categorially different. Piper said of herself that biologically something is just â€˜a little offâ€™. She has â€˜too little or too much or whatever it is that makes you have these issuesâ€™. Distinct from â€˜crazy peopleâ€™, she has control over her mind and her story. All she needs is a little pill. Yet at the same time, her â€˜conditionâ€™ is also different from the mundane challenges that normal people might face. Piper was adamant that her nervousness in social situations is different from ordinary shyness. Her taking of medication is warranted. She has a third condition caused by an â€˜imbalanceâ€™.</p><p>The â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ </p><p>To reconcile their perspective with the fact that they had received a psychiatric diagnosis, many interviewees credited a medical professional or a confidant for suggesting something like this third condition idea to them. Others emphasised the ordinariness of their experience and compared it to the types of routine problems that regular physicians treat. As one interviewee put it, â€˜all you have to do is take a pillâ€™.</p><p>There are echoes here of the messages conveyed in direct-to-consumer advertising for psychiatric medication. Iâ€™ve analysed the content of these adverts and found that distress, as listed in symptoms and portrayed in the patientsâ€™ stories, is often presented as a â€˜real medical conditionâ€™ and yet unlike mental illness. The ads contain no references to psychiatrists or to the diagnostic manual of mental disorders from the American Psychiatric Association (APA), nor use of phrases such as â€˜mental illnessâ€™ or â€˜mental disorderâ€™, and no depictions of those affected as anything but productive and successful citizens. In the words of our interviewees and in the advertising messages, the â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ against whom the implicit comparisons are being drawn.</p><p>The views we encountered in our interviews are consistent with national surveys of public opinion about mental health. Today, with respect to mental health problems, the lay public much more freely endorses biological causes, the seeking of medical help and the use of psychoactive medications than in the past. Their views have converged with the biological perspectives long promoted in public campaigns to reduce the stigma of mental illness. According to the American anti-stigma organisation Bring Change to Mind, for instance: â€˜The fact is, a mental illness is a disorder of the brain â€“ your bodyâ€™s most important organ.â€™ Among anti-stigma researchers and activists, the evolution in public attitudes toward biological psychiatry has been celebrated as a sign that the public has at long last become â€˜literateâ€™, with a â€˜more scientificâ€™ even â€˜sophisticatedâ€™ understanding of mental illness.</p><p>In promoting a biogenetic causal theory, anti-stigma campaigners â€“ as well as psychiatrists, the popular media, and others â€“ hoped to convince people that mental illnesses are â€˜just likeâ€™ other chronic physical ailments, such as â€˜heart disease or diabetesâ€™, to <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-is-mental-illness" target="_blank">quote</a> the APA, and could be medically addressed. This approach would, in turn, alleviate mental illness stigma and foster tolerance by reducing the (allegedly common) tendency to hold sufferers responsible for their condition. The result, it was confidently believed, would promote treatment optimism and increased help-seeking.</p><p>But something unexpected happened. The public embrace of neurobiology has not led to a more benevolent orientation toward the mentally ill. Rather, according to an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4409431/" target="_blank">editorial</a> in the <em>Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience</em> in 2015, â€˜well-conducted studies have concluded, almost uniformlyâ€™ that the stigma-reduction strategy of recent decades, informed by â€˜biogenetic attribution of all mental disordersâ€™, has â€˜not only not worked, but also may have worsened public attitudes and behaviour toward those with mental illnessesâ€™. Such studies have shown that the growing endorsement of biological causation has continued to exacerbate the stigmatising of mental illness among the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/biogenetic-explanations-and-public-acceptance-of-mental-illness-systematic-review-of-population-studies/E6078EED07031B5828DB84FCDC90657F" target="_blank">general public</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20493559/" target="_blank">patients</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/17786" target="_blank">professionals</a>.</p><p>What accounts for this paradoxical result?</p><p><strong>I believe that </strong>our interviews reveal a crucial reason. While people accepted a neurobiological explanation for their problems, they struggled against the dehumanising notion that their thoughts, feelings or behaviour were mechanistically <em>caused.</em> Drawing on clinicians, drug ads and the popular media, the caricature of the seriously mentally ill served as a pivotal image by which to contrast and affirm their own control and self-determination. Millions of Americans â€“ and countless others in Western countries â€“ likely find themselves sharing this or a similar perspective.</p><p>The idea that oneâ€™s distress is primarily caused by a neurochemical deficiency that can be corrected by a drug is a fiction</p><p>As I argue in my <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo48408677.html" target="_blank">book</a> <em>Chemically Imbalanced</em> (2020), to defeat this othering and reduce stigma, clinical practice needs to move away from biogenetic causal language. Psychiatric research doesnâ€™t support the notion of simple cause and effect in mental health, instead uncovering a far more complex and indeterminate picture of vulnerabilities. There is no evidence to justify the continued promotion of one-dimensional theories such as â€˜chemical imbalanceâ€™. Nor does the beneficial use of psychiatric medicines require it. In fact, their precise mechanism of action and relation to troublesome experience <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00407/full" target="_blank">remains</a> a mystery. It would be more truthful for mental health professionals and public health campaigns to acknowledge this.</p><p>Itâ€™s true, as interviewees such as Jenna made clear, that patients often find biogenetic language appealing. It provides a way to establish their suffering as both tangible and unfeigned, and it offers a simple account and positive prognosis for their struggles. However, the …</p></div></div></div>

            <figure><img src="https://cdn.spark.app/media/bostata/image/blog_w720.png" alt="blog"></figure><p>Two years ago we set up <strong><a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki">Open-Source Snowplow</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>at <strong><a href="https://www.cargurus.com/">CarGurus</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>to fulfill a need for self-managed client-side instrumentation. Since that time it has become incredibly impactful for the entire company and has scaled significantly beyond what was originally envisioned. The following is an overview ofÂ&nbsp;<strong>why we set  up the system</strong>,Â&nbsp;<strong>our experience with it,</strong>Â&nbsp;<strong>what we have learned</strong>, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>where we see it continuing to go.</strong></p><p>This post is quite long, so before getting too far into the details....</p><h3>Total events collected: <mark>&gt;268 billion</mark></h3><h3>Data collected: <mark>&gt; 1.5pb (uncompressed)</mark></h3><h3>Event volume: <mark>~ 1 billion events/day</mark></h3><h3>Max Daily Throughput: <mark>~ 15k events/second (sustained during peak hours)</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct events: </strong><mark><strong>hundreds and hundreds</strong></mark></h3><h3>Infrastructure upgrade duration: <mark>less than two minutes with zero downtime</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct sites with Snowplow tracking: </strong><mark><strong>&gt; 180</strong></mark></h3><p><em>So let's dive in.</em></p><p>We chose Snowplow instead of building our own event tracking system, and plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future. Why? </p><h3><strong>We wanted to independently manage and scale data collection systems.</strong></h3><p>A conversation early in my tenure at CarGurus made a topic abundantly clear: many teams had a strong desire to separate concerns. At that time the company was growing quickly and demands were rapidly changing. Analysts and engineers were joining, onboarding fast, and asking completely new questions of our data. It was all-too-common to tell them their questions simply could not be answered due to the additional load tracking would place on production systems.</p><p>After being personally involved with a couple event-volume-related site outages, it was evident we needed to rethink data collection systems. We needed to be able to scale data collection infrastructure completely separately from application infrastructure, and we needed to significantly isolate the blast radius if something went wrong.</p><p>Snowplow was a strongÂ&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span>.</p><h3>We wanted to modernize event collection systems.</h3><p>Another requirement of choosing Snowplow was its ability to quickly and effectively introduce aÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://lambda-architecture.net/">lambda architecture</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>into our analytics stack. As customer needs and demands evolved, we found that having both a real-time, low-latency (on the order of hundreds of milliseconds) component of the event pipeline as well as a batch-based, higher-latency (on the order of minutes) component gave usÂ&nbsp;significantÂ&nbsp;flexibility toÂ&nbsp;proactively fulfill stakeholder asks before they surfaced<em>.</em></p><p>Our pipelines are set up in AWS with <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Kinesis</a></strong> as transport and <strong><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a></strong> as long-term data storage. As stakeholders need real-time access to enriched data, Kinesis is the go-to location. If stakeholders need access to historical event data or want to augment it with other sources in the data warehouse, Snowflake is the place to go.</p><p>Snowplow allowed us to introduce new ideas and methodologies and fulfill both point-in-time and future stakeholder needs.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>The world of third-party tracking is rapidly changing and will continue to.</h3><p>As anyone involved in the world of client-side analytics is probably well-aware of, third-party tracking is increasingly going away. Initiatives like <strong><a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html">this</a></strong>Â&nbsp;and <strong><a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention-policy/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>andÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/duckduckgo-adds-tracker-blocking-to-help-curb-the-wider-surveillance-web/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>are fantastic for online privacy (and commendable), but have major implications for tracking and analytics. With an eye towards the future we knew we needed to decrease reliance on Google Analytics, Adobe, Heap, and all other similar third-party tracking systems if we wanted full insight into web traffic. We wanted 100% of site behavior instead of sampled GA or ad-blocked Adobe. And we wanted to own the resulting data.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to track first-party web activity and regain full visibility into usage behavior on our site.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>Snowplow sets a high bar for fault-tolerance, redundancy, and durability.</h3><p>When set up properly, the Snowplow infrastructure isÂ&nbsp;extremelyÂ&nbsp;fault-tolerant. We set up ours in AWS and have not regretted it whatsoever.</p><p>Javascript tracking code buffers unsent events locally in the case of collection infrastructure being down. AWS application load balancers are multi-AZ and AWS maintains a good SLA for them. All access logs are retained for a period of time in case the load balancer is up but the rest of the system is down. Kinesis replicates data across three AZ's by default, and retention can be configured up to 168 hours in the case of mid-pipeline enrichment outages. S3 is highly durable and highly available by default. And the list goes on....</p><h3>We wanted to own all data that was generated.</h3><p>As mentioned above, if we were going to invest time and money building scalable event-collection infrastructure, <em>we simply</em>Â&nbsp;<em>had to own the outcome.</em>Â&nbsp;It is a significant investment to get large-scale infrastructure and instrumentation off the ground, and it's hard to do tracking in a way that doesn't impose a burden on analysts down the road (think <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events">Google Analytics events</a>).</p><p>We didn't want to deal with API rate limiting when attempting to recover our data. We didn't want to be tied to BigQuery, and we didn't want our customers' data flowing through other companies' systems.</p><h3>We needed to keep data quality high.</h3><p>When building out data collection and processing systems, it's one thing to set up infrastructure. It's a completely different story to keep quality high as priorities, teams, and customer demands shift. It's even harder to impose more work in an attempt to keep data "clean".</p><p>The way snowplow handles event validation and stream-redirection was a perfect fit in our case. After setting the system up we quickly found that leveraging <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/2-Specific-event-tracking-with-the-Javascript-tracker#trackSelfDescribingEvent">Self-Describing Events</a>Â&nbsp;and the associated <a href="https://json-schema.org/">jsonschemas</a> empowered us to enforce data quality in a very low-friction way. Whenever events start flowing (with a bad push, etc) that don't adhere to the implementing party's jsonschema, they are redirected out of the "good" path for immediate review and recovery. Self-describing events (and jsonschemas) also gave us the ability to do some pretty neat automation, which will be covered later.</p><h3>The world of compliance is changing rapidly and we needed the ability to audit every piece of information.</h3><p>Since we first set up Snowplow the world has been forced to navigate two big data-privacy hurdles: <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>. Since we own and operate all collection infrastructure we did not need to get a third-party vendor DPA. Snowplow gives a significant amount of flexibility for enriching and redirecting PII, as well as configurable pseudonymization. It's good, it "just works", and it has saved us a considerable amount of time.</p><p>We've also spent a significant amount of time persisting full system lineage when splitting events into Snowflake which makes it easy to fully adhere to privacy legislation and associated requirements.</p><h3>We wanted to build, guide, and get out of the way.</h3><p>My favorite part about programming and tech isÂ&nbsp;building (machine) processes, cultivating good (human) habits, and getting out of the way. An early challenge was maintainingÂ&nbsp;clear, consistent definitions of data between frontend engineers (the implementer of tracking) and analysts (the stakeholders of said tracking). Event data was previously tracked, flowed through a number of different systems, and was often renamed (sometimes several times) when it finally landed in Snowflake.. Snowplow's self-describing events have allowed us to shift many conversations away from data pipeline engineers and back to where they should be taking place. I was able to back away since stakeholders and implementers were able to approach important conversations from a point of shared, consistent understanding.</p><h3>Last but not least, we needed to hit the ground running.</h3><p>While we may have had time to build out our own system from scratch, why build when you can lean on the backs of giants? The community of people contributing to Snowplow has grown significantly since the first time I implemented it, and people all over the world have run into almost every challenge imaginable. As fun as it would have been to deconstruct the system and build and implement our own,Â&nbsp;<em>it simply wasn't worth it.Â&nbsp;</em>Our stakeholders had questions that they wanted answered "yesterday" and their needs were our priority #1.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to hit the ground running and answer real business questions "now".Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h2>Phase 1: Keep It Simple. Get It Running. Prove the System's Worth.</h2><p>When Snowplow was first rolled out there was a single mission in mind:Â&nbsp;<em>make sure it was a good organizational fit.Â&nbsp;</em>We had systems in place with some functional overlap already, so we had to make sure we weren't introducing a new system simply........ for the sake of introducing a new system. Or staking claim in others' territory. The system had to work. It had to answer questions that had been previously-unanswerable. It had to be robust. And it had to solve real-life challenges.</p><h3>We very consciously chose to<strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Automate all infrastructure.</strong> We wanted to scale, upgrade, and roll out entirely new sets of infrastructure fast. Everything was <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraformed</a>Â&nbsp;and infrastructure was 100% immutable.</p><p><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> We could have gone straight to k8s or autoscaling clusters or ecs or eks or any other new (admittedly attractive) thing. But we didn't. We wanted to see how the system itself would perform and scale.</p><p><strong>Focus on the stakeholder.Â&nbsp;</strong>The only way this initiative was going to work was if others felt ownership of it, it decreased their pain, it empowered them to do their jobs better, or a combination of all. Instead of focusing on a hip/cool/hot/new systemÂ&nbsp;<em>we focused on answering the questions at hand.</em></p><h3>We initially choseÂ&nbsp;<strong>not to</strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Pile on infrastructure complexity or over-optimize.</strong>Â&nbsp;We wanted to see how the system performed at scale when viewed under a magnifying lens. Since the best way to put a system through its paces is by minimizing complexity and other overhead, that's what we did. We wanted to know what goes wrong and potential system bottlenecks.</p><p><strong>Implement a widespread mandate.Â&nbsp;</strong>I strongly believe the most effective way to approach important conversations is with real-life (not theoretical) …</p></article></div>

<p>This is going to be a look at my philosophy and views on ActivityPub and why I believe the solutions to ActivityPub criticisms must come from communities. I believe there needs to be a clear way for communities to form and build upon the ActivityPub specification. The public needs to do so while keeping the cost to participate as close to zero as possible. At the end, I will present a concrete solution of extending ActivityPub to help organize its own extensions.</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that the reader is familiar with the ActivityPub protocol or at least familiar enough such that I don’t need to give background information.</p>

<h2>Background: Go-fed and I</h2>

<p>I don’t expect folks to know me. On Mastodon I am <a href="https://mastodon.technology/@cj">@cj@mastodon.technology</a>. I have been working on an ActivityPub library implementation in golang [<a href="https://go-fed.org/">go-fed</a>] for a little over a year. I started back in late November or early December of 2017, just before the ActivityPub spec matured. Due to the complicated technical solution required, it took me quite a long time to have a first release. It’s taken me another six or eight months to work toward the next major release of go-fed. Also, building a library means I don’t have direct end-users like other projects have. Honestly, I don’t mind. It has allowed me to think much more about general development practices around ActivityPub since my direct users are other software developers.</p>

<p>So please consider this post a year in the making.</p>

<h2>The Incomplete Philosophy &amp; Fediverse of Flavors</h2>

<p>I want to give an overview of a philosophy that I’ve adopted while working on ActivityPub. Succinctly: I view ActivityPub as a transport protocol that alone is not sufficient to build an application.</p>

<p>It’s not meant to dictate what an application is, nor its domain’s behaviors, nor its domain’s side effects. There are two kinds of federating: transmitting data and dictating peer app behavior. ActivityPub is a minimalistic protocol governing the sharing of information and the most sparse set of side effects in order to allow federation (transmission) between peers. It doesn’t dictate federation (app behavior) between peers for all domains. Anything more than just sending and receiving information needs to be built on top of ActivityPub as an extension.</p>

<p>ActivityPub alone is not a specification that solves all domain behaviors.</p>

<p>It has taken me a long time to realize this. ActivityPub doesn’t make it easy to adopt this philosophy because it also happens to contain its own “ActivityPub extension” specifically for the social media domain. This is why social media applications have adopted ActivityPub – the “ActivityPub extension” for the social media domain is itself embedded and hidden within the original ActivityPub specification. The ActivityPub specification handles both kinds of federating (transmission and app behavior) for the social media domain to a certain degree.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a code forge application would use ActivityPub to guarantee it can physically transmit and receive data federatively. But the ActivityPub specification alone is insufficient at dictating what other code forge applications may or may not do with the data. That requires building an ActivityPub extension by the code forge community. I think this is a fundamental issue that some folks have with ActivityPub. It does not dictate to peers what it may or may not do with the data they receive and the expectations around handling such data for other domains.</p>

<p>When looking at ActivityPub as an incomplete specification, there are some neat consequences. I have a cheesy metaphor for it. Building on ActivityPub allows creating different “flavors” of Fediverse: a social media one, an economic one, a code forge one, an educational one, and so on. Despite all the different flavors of Fediverse, they are all still a part of the same network. Developers may have their apps freely pick and choose which flavors of Fediverse to use to build the user experience they want from a single-flavor microblog to a multi-flavor code-forge-managed-by-an-economic-co-op. These “flavors” are simply different domains.</p>

<p>Also, each developer’s application doesn’t have to develop their own standard. They could, but I think it’s more preferable that each domain of the Fediverse builds one or more independent communities to standardize their specific solutions through the use of ActivityStreams extensions. Concretely, all that needs to be done is to define new ActivityStreams types and properties, as well as new expected behaviors when handling these types and properties. This is similar to Sections 6 and 7 of the ActivityPub specification. From there, developers would look only at the flavors they cared about and pick those additional behaviors to implement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when the ActivityPub protocol was published there was neither guidance nor support on how to build these communities, how to develop more specialized domains, or how to organize more rigorous behaviors around the data being shared. And there still isn’t.</p>

<p>If this mindset seems alien or the philosophy is hard to take seriously, let’s step back and reframe ourselves. ActivityStreams comes as a form of RDF data known as JSON-LD. In contrast to the modern web which uses HTTP to serve and share hypertext documents linked together by hyperlinks, ActivityPub uses HTTP to serve and share structured-data JSON documents linked by IRIs. REST follows this model closely, so none of this is surprising. However, ActivityPub takes it one step further by specifying a way to transmit this data without having to build (or code generate) custom REST client endpoints. This is a key differentiator, but at a cost.</p>

<p>The cost is that developers who are used to an application-specific mindset struggle with viewing ActivityPub as a purposefully incomplete specification since it doesn’t specify federating (app behavior) in all domains. This is exacerbated by ActivityPub being touted as a complete specification. When comparing against application-specific REST APIs that are concrete, it makes sense that forcing ActivityPub upon this community is bound to generate criticisms along the vein of “it’s underspecified,” “it’s ambiguous,” and “look how I can write a broken compliant application.”</p>

<p>While I tend to view those particular kinds of criticisms as simply stemming from a philosophical difference, there are a lot of remaining criticisms I agree with. Issues such as security, discoverability, or lacking certain social media features. I really do think the next steps involve building the community of developers and interested non-technical folks in such a way that allows for multiple independent specifications to build off of ActivityPub.</p>

<h2>The Future: Addressing Criticisms &amp; Expanding Domains</h2>

<p>I don’t expect people to buy into my mindset or philosophy on what ActivityPub is and what those next steps should be. At minimum, I hope folks that reject it at least appreciate where I am coming from. I know it’s very easy to discuss general principles and philosophies, so now I would like to offer my own personal fantasy, in concrete terms, of what could be in store for the future. To do so, I need to identify the problems it is solving.</p>

<p>The first problem is getting different ActivityPub communities to self-organize to solve their own domain problems, build their own specifications on top of ActivityPub, and hold each other accountable at sticking to those specifications rigorously. A second problem is discoverability of these specifications for fellow developers without having a centralized organization hosting a registry or dictating a process. The cost of extending ActivityPub should always remain as close to zero as possible for numerous philosophical and moral reasons that I don’t want to get into here.</p>

<p>Note that there is some prior art. ForgeFed has solved the first problem by hosting a repository on GitHub and having a mailing list at Framasoft. They organized their own process and collaborated to build and create several proposals. So there is some evidence that existing tools can be sufficient for solving the self-organizing problem. However, it does not solve the second problem of getting would-be ActivityPub developers to discover these extensions.</p>

<p>My simple proposed fantasy is: Why not build on top of ActivityPub to solve both of these problems?</p>

<p>First, we as a community create an ActivityStreams extension and define behaviors to document the specifications built on top of ActivityPub. We now have a way to store ActivityPub extension specifications in the Fediverse itself. Next, building an application server that understands this extension and can federate it over ActivityPub means anyone can simply host an instance, allow users to register, build its community, and be free to draft new specifications on top of ActivityPub. Since this data is then federated by ActivityPub itself, it is reachable by both technical and non-technical users. There is neither a central authority nor a central registry as each community is responsible for its own ActivityPub specifications. This is the democratization of ActivityPub across all domains. People cannot have their ActivityPub extension specification censored. As long as the core ActivityPub protocol as currently written is followed, federation compatibility naturally leads to new domains and apps implementing them.</p>

<p>As hosts of these specs, we would all have to be good citizens and not purposefully and maliciously create specifications that collide namespaces or repurpose existing semantics from other specs in ways that are incompatible. Instances and specific specs may become blacklisted if obviously malicious. My fantasy solution does not solve these human problems, but it is not meant to. It’s meant to help facilitate human interactions. I concede this proposal will make protocol purists uncomfortable with the idea of bringing humanity so close to the heart of a technical process. I know some folks …</p></div></div></div>

                    <p>What is the desired outcome for a software product team?</p><p>Completing as many tickets as possible? Or shipping a feature that your customers want and move the needle for your business?</p><p>The answer, I’m sure, is the latter.</p><p>Today, more software updates are being shipped than ever before. Unfortunately, only a few have an impact.</p><blockquote>Features you ship need to make an impact and be frequent enough to build relationships with hard-won customers.</blockquote><p>That’s a lot riding on the quality of the software you ship. And not many teams realize that.</p><p>If you want to avoid underwhelming <em>your</em> customers, be sure to follow these three rules when building software features.</p><hr><h3 id="rule-1-building-features-is-not-about-checking-off-tickets">Rule 1: Building features is not about checking off tickets</h3><p>It shouldn’t come as a surprise that building features aren’t about checking off tickets and tasks in your issue tracker. But you and I end up obsessing about it anyway. And get disappointed when the software you ship isn’t up to the mark!</p><p>It’s why <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/it-project-management-buyer-trends-2016/">56% of managers are looking to switch their project management tool every year</a>.</p><p>At Zepel, we don’t start by assigning tasks. Doing this gives each member only a disconnected piece of the entire feature. It’s the equivalent of micro-management.</p><blockquote>Building with tickets and tasks gives your team only a disconnected piece of the feature.</blockquote><p>We think software teams do their best work when they have the whole picture. And not with isolated tickets.</p><p>Instead of giving small isolated chunks, the team is given a feature document. It contains a detailed spec with user stories on what the feature should or shouldn’t do. That way, the team knows what the user is trying to accomplish with the feature.</p><p>From here, it is up to the team to decide how they build it. The developers and designers know the details and have all the information they need about what the feature should and shouldn't do. They're in better position to make the right decision. </p><p>After all, the development team is the one doing the real work. </p><blockquote>A manager may come up with what looks like a solid plan with assigned tickets and issues. <p>However, it rarely matches the reality of software development.</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id="rule-2-progress-of-the-feature-is-more-important-than-the-task">Rule 2: Progress of the feature is more important than the task</h3><p>Far too often we miss the forest for the trees.</p><p>On one end you have people obsessed at getting every pixel right. And on the other end, you have folks whose focus is shipping as quickly as possible.</p><p><em>*Our velocity chart is dropping. We need to find a way to ship faster!*</em></p><p>Both are dangerous. And they’re both a consequence of thinking in outputs instead of outcomes.</p><p>At Zepel, we look at building software features as a balancing act between the known and the unknown. </p><p>Work items in the known bucket are much more reliable. You’ve already figured them out or you have experience doing it. These are the ones you can ship quickly. The unknowns require more research and have questions that need to be answered.</p><blockquote>The realities of software development is rarely straightforward. There are far more unknowns than knowns when you build software.</blockquote><p>So, if the unknown work item isn’t going to move the needle and you’ve spent considerable time doing research, it’s important to keep it aside.</p><p>And when you’re faced with a situation where you can’t make a decision, ask yourself: <strong>what new information is needed to make a decision</strong>. If you’re unable to identify it, it’s best to move on.</p><p>It's normal to feel like you’re making a compromise at this point. A good approach is to ask yourself: <strong>is what you're building a step up for your customers from what they're used to?</strong> If the answer is yes, then you shouldn’t sweat too much about it.</p><hr><h3 id="rule-3-people-over-processes-and-tools">Rule 3: People over processes and tools</h3><p>It doesn’t matter if you’re following agile methodologies. It doesn’t matter if you’re following scrum or kanban. If your team members are unhappy, your processes and well thought out charts are as good as an air cooler in Antarctica.</p><p>Designers and developers want to do their best work. They care about having a consistent design language, great experience, and having a cohesive code base that covering all edge cases. They take pride in their work and that’s important.</p><blockquote>The best development teams keep the broader purpose of the feature in mind while focusing on the finer details.</blockquote><p>The reason why most teams aren't productive is because these processes are too rigid. They hinder them from gaining complete context for them to do their best work.</p><p><strong>Instead of trying to fine-tune the process further, it helps to shift the focus towards people.</strong> In practice it looks like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Clarify goals frequently and realign people towards the goal:</strong> It’s easy to get caught up in completing a task and the finer details, forgetting the goal — ship a usable feature.</li><li><strong>Set and reset expectations:</strong> Most of us set expectations at the beginning. But it’s equally important to reset them after a checkpoint. Every time you set and reset expectations, it’s an opportunity to reinforce and steer the team towards the goal.</li><li><strong>Consistent check-ins: </strong>Check-ins do not only mean daily scrum meetings. Just asking a colleague if they need an outside perspective can go a long way in helping them do better work.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="product-development-focus-on-the-result">Product development: Focus on the result</h2><p>Product development by its nature is different from issue tracking. People agree that the idea of building features by tracking one single ticket at a time is absurd. And yet, you still do it day-in and day-out.</p><p>This comes when you focus on outputs instead of outcomes. And when you’re limited by the tools you use. They make you put processes and tools over people.</p><p>There was a time when simply checking off tasks was all that mattered. It’s important. But in a demanding market with demanding customers, shoehorning developers into ticket-movers isn’t nearly enough to build solid products.</p><p>Instead, focus on the result. It enables you to think of the different ways to achieve the outcome and the multiple cases you would’ve missed had you spent time by thinking in tickets.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593278017230_21391"><div><p>Generics what now? This friendly, down-to-earth tutorial explains what generic functions and types are, why we need them, how they work in Go, and where we can use them. It's easy and fun, so let's dance!</p>
<p>(<em data-preserve-html-node="true">Note:The support for generics in Go that I describe here isn't yet released, and the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md">proposal for how it would work</a> is under active development. Right now you can play with it in the <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">generics-enabled version of the Go Playground</a>, or you can use the experimental <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">go2go tool</a> to try Go's generics support in your own programs.</em>)</p>
<h2 id="what-are-generics-">What are generics?</h2>
<p>As you know, Go is a <em>typed</em> language, meaning that every variable and value in your program has some specific type, like <code>int</code> or <code>string</code>. When we write functions, we need to specify the type of their parameters in what's called the <em>function signature</em>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintString(s string) {</code></pre>
<p>Here, the parameter <code>s</code> is of type <code>string</code>. We can imagine writing similar versions of this function which take an <code>int</code>, a <code>float64</code>, an arbitrary struct type, and so on. But that would be inconvenient for more than a handful of specific types, and though we can sometimes use <em>interfaces</em> to solve this problem (as described in the <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/map-string-interface"><code>map[string]interface</code> tutorial</a>, for example), that approach has many limitations.</p>
<h2 id="generic-functions-in-go">Generic functions in Go</h2>
<p>Instead, we would like to declare a <em>generic function</em> <code>PrintAnything</code>, which takes an argument of an arbitrary type T, and does something with it.</p>
<p>Here's what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintAnything(type T)(thing T) {</code></pre>
<p>Simple, right? How do we call it? Equally simply:</p>
<pre><code>PrintAnything("Hello!")</code></pre>
<p>In the rare cases where Go can't guess what type T is based on the value we pass to the function, we can make it explicit:</p>
<pre><code>PrintAnything(int)(99)</code></pre>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>It's pretty easy to implement the <code>PrintAnything</code> function, because the <code>fmt</code> library can print anything anyway. Suppose we wanted to write our own version of something like <code>strings.Join</code>, which takes a slice of T, and returns a single string that joins them all together. Let's try:</p>
<pre><code>// I have a bad feeling about this.
func Join(type T)(things []T) (result string) {
    for _, v := range things {
        result += v.String()
    }
    return result
}</code></pre>
<p>We've created a generic function <code>Join()</code> which takes, for an arbitrary type T, a parameter which is a slice of T. Great, but now we run into a problem:</p>
<pre><code>output := Join([]string{"a", "b", "c"})
// v.String undefined (type bound for T has no method String)</code></pre><p>Thing is, inside the <code>Join()</code> function, we want to call <code>.String()</code> on each slice element <code>v</code> to turn it into a string. But Go needs to be able to check in advance that type T has a <code>String()</code> method, and since it doesn't know what T is, it can't do that!</p>
<p>What we need to do is <em>constrain</em> the type T slightly. Instead of accepting literally any type, we're really only interested in types which have a <code>String()</code> method. Any such type will be an acceptable input to our <code>Join()</code> function, so how do we express that constraint in Go? We use an <em>interface</em>:</p>
<pre><code>type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}</code></pre>
<p>This specifies that a given type has a <code>String()</code> method. So now we can apply this constraint to the type of our generic function:</p>
<pre><code>func Join(type T Stringer) ...</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>Stringer</code> guarantees that any value of type T will have a <code>String()</code> method, Go will now happily let us call it inside the function. But if you try to call the <code>Join()</code> function with a slice of some type that <em>doesn't</em> satisfy <code>Stringer</code> (for example <code>int</code>), Go will complain:</p>
<pre><code>result := Join([]int{1, 2, 3})
// int does not satisfy Stringer (missing method String)</code></pre><h2 id="the-comparable-constraint">The <code>comparable</code> constraint</h2>
<p>Constraints based on method sets, like <code>Stringer</code>, are useful, but what if we want to do something with our generic input that doesn't involve calling a method?</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to write an <code>Equal</code> function which takes two parameters of type T, and return <code>true</code> if they are equal, or <code>false</code> otherwise. Let's have a go:</p>
<pre><code>// This won't work.
func Equal(type T)(a, b T) bool {
    return a == b
}

fmt.Println(Equal(1, 1))
// cannot compare a == b (operator == not defined for T)</code></pre>
<p>This is the same kind of issue as we had in <code>Join()</code> with the <code>String()</code> method, but since we're not <em>calling</em> a method now, we can't use a constraint based on a method set. Instead, we need to constrain T to only types that work with the <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> operators, which are known as <em>comparable</em> types. Fortunately there's a straightforward way to specify this: use the built-in <code>comparable</code> constraint.</p>
<pre><code>func Equal(type T comparable) ...</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-constraints-package">The <code>constraints</code> package</h2>
<p>Just to be difficult, suppose we want to do something with values of T which isn't either comparing them or calling methods on them. For example, suppose we want to write a <code>Max()</code> function for a generic type T which takes a slice of T and returns the element with the highest value. We might try something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Nope.
func Max(type T)(input []T) (max T) {
    for _, v := range input {
        if v &gt; max {
            max = v
        }
    }
    return max
}</code></pre>
<p>I'm not feeling very optimistic about this, but let's see what happens:</p>
<pre><code>fmt.Println(Max([]int{1, 2, 3}))
// cannot compare v &gt; max (operator &gt; not defined for T)</code></pre>
<p>Again, Go can't prove ahead of time that the type T will work with the <code>&gt;</code> operator (that is to say, that T is <em>ordered</em>). How can we fix this? We could simply list every possible allowed type in a constraint, like this (known as a <em>type list</em>):</p>
<pre><code>type Ordered interface {
    type int, int8, int16, int32, int64,
        uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr,
        float32, float64,
        string
}</code></pre>
<p>Fortunately for your keyboard, this and other useful constraints are already defined for us in the standard library's <code>constraints</code> package, so we can import that and use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>func Max(type T constraints.Ordered) ...</code></pre>
<p>Problem solved!</p>
<h2 id="generic-types">Generic types</h2>
<p>So far, so cool. We know how to write functions that can take arguments of any type. But what if we want to create a <em>type</em> that can contain any type? For example, a 'slice of anything' type. That turns out to be very easy:</p>
<pre><code>type Bunch(type T) []T</code></pre>
<p>We're saying that for a given type T, a <code>Bunch(T)</code> is a slice of values of type T. For example, a <code>Bunch(int)</code> is a slice of <code>int</code>. We can create values of that type in the normal way:</p>
<pre><code>x := Bunch(int){1, 2, 3}</code></pre>
<p>Just as you'd expect, we can write generic functions which take generic types:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintBunch(type T)(b Bunch(T)) {</code></pre>
<p>Methods, too:</p>
<pre><code>func (b Bunch(T)) Print() {</code></pre>
<p>We can also apply constraints to generic types:</p>
<pre><code>type StringableBunch(type T Stringer) []T</code></pre>
<h2 id="golang-generics-playground">Golang generics playground</h2>
<p>So that you can play with the current implementation of the generics proposal (for example to try the code samples in this tutorial), the Go team have provided a generics-enabled version of the Go Playground here:</p>
<p><a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">Golang generics playground</a></p>
<p>It works exactly the same way as the normal <a href="https://play.golang.org/">Go playground</a> we know and love, except that it supports the generic syntax described here. Because it's not possible to run all Go code in the playground (for example, code that makes network calls or accesses the filesystem), you can also try out the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">go2go tool</a>, which translates code using generics to code which compiles with the current version of Go.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<h3 id="will-golang-get-generics-">Will Golang get generics?</h3>
<p>Almost certainly yes. The current proposal for generics support in Go, as outlined in this tutorial, was announced in June 2020 in a blog post: <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">The Next Step for Generics</a>, and is being evaluated by the community. Since Go's lack of generics has often been cited as holding back the more widespread adoption of Go, the reaction has been generally positive.</p>
<p>The Golang generics roadmap currently specifies a possible release date as early as Go version 1.17, which would be in August 2021 (but it may not be as soon as that, depending on how much the current proposal evolves based on feedback).</p>
<p>Until then you can use the <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">Generics Playground</a> to experiment with it and try out the examples here.</p>
<h3 id="generics-vs-interfaces-are-there-alternatives-to-generics-">Generics vs interfaces: are there alternatives to generics?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/map-string-interface"><code>map[string]interface</code> tutorial</a>, we can already write Go code that handles values of any type, without using generic functions or types, by means of <em>interfaces</em>. However, if you want to write a library that implements things like collections of arbitrary types, using a generic type is much simpler and more convenient than using an interface.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-use-code-generation-instead-of-generics-">Can I use code generation instead of generics?</h3>
<p>The 'code generator' approach has been the other traditional way of dealing with such problems before the advent of generics in Go. Essentially, it involves using the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generate"><code>go generate</code> tool</a> to produce Go code for each of the specific types that you need to handle in your library.</p>
<p>While this works, it's awkward to use, limited in its flexibility, and requires an extra build step. While code generation is still useful for some things, it's nice that we no longer have to use it to simulate generic functions and types in Go.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-contracts-">What are contracts?</h3>
<p>An earlier <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-contracts.md">draft design</a> for generics in Go used a similar syntax to what we have today, but it implemented type constraints using a new keyword <code>contract</code>, instead of the existing <code>interface</code>. This was not popular for various reasons, and is now superseded.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Today, we will answer the question – <strong>when is hacking illegal and legal?</strong></span></p><p><span>Before we jump into the topic about when hacking is considered illegal and when it is considered legal, let’s try to understand what hacking is.</span></p><h2><b>What Is Hacking?</b></h2><p><span>There are many ways in which the process of hacking could be explained. It could be described as a breach of the system or unauthorized access. Still, hacking is an unwarranted attempt to infiltrate a computer or any other electronic system to attain information about something or someone.</span></p><p><span>Anytime we hear or read about someone’s computer or some network being hacked, we instantly picture an individual sitting in a dark room full of tangled wires, computer screens, and multiple keyboards, who is rapidly typing some programming language on one of the computer screens. While hacking is shown as something quite intriguing in motion pictures, in actuality, it is entirely different. Websites like SecureBlitz, </span><a href="http://techwhoop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Techwhoop.com</span></a>, and other cybersecurity blogs<span>&nbsp;can educate you with the measures you should take if your device is hacked.</span></p><p><span>The hacking scenes shown in the movies or T.V. shows are full of action, suspense, and drama, making it look enjoyable or entertaining. But in reality, hacking is quite dull. The hacker types a series of commands telling the computer system what to do, via a programming language like Python or Perl or LISP, and waits for the results, which might take hours, but the computer does the actual part of hacking. Along with being tedious and time-consuming, piracy is also complicated and sometimes dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Hackers use many different types of tools to hack into a software system. Few of these tools are:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>Sn1per</strong> – It is a vulnerability scanner used by hackers to detect weak spots in a system or network.</span></li><li><span><strong>John The Ripper (JTR)</strong> – This is a favorite tool amongst hackers. It is used for cracking even the most complicated passwords in the form of a dictionary attack. A dictionary attack is a form of brute force where the hacker enters numerous passwords hoping to guess the right one eventually.</span></li><li><span><strong>Metasploit</strong> – This is a Penetration Testing Software. It is a hacking framework used to deploy payloads into vulnerabilities. It provides information about the weaknesses in software.</span></li><li><span><strong>Wireshark</strong> – It is a network traffic analyzer used for network troubleshooting and analysis.</span></li></ul><h3><b>There are three types of hackers –</b></h3><ul><li><span>The Black Hat Hackers,</span></li><li><span>The White Hat Hackers, and</span></li><li><span>The Grey Hat Hackers.</span></li></ul><p><span>The difference between each will be discussed below.</span></p><h2><b>When Is Hacking Illegal And Legal?</b></h2><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?ssl=1"><img title="when is hacking illegal and legal" src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=640%2C432&amp;ssl=1" alt="when is hacking illegal and legal" width="640" height="432" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=640%2C432&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>Hacking has always been portrayed as a felony, an unauthorized entry into a </span><a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/N/network.html"><span>network</span></a><span>. But it started when MIT introduced the first computer hackers whose job was to modify the software to work better and faster. However, some people started using this software for felonious activities.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>When Is Hacking Illegal?</b></h2><p><span>When a hacker tries to breach a system without authorization, it is considered unlawful. These kinds of hackers are called Black Hat Hackers. They are the type of hackers who are known for their malicious and notorious reasons for hacking. Initially, hackers used to hack to show that they can breach a system. They used to cut just for fun.</span></p><p><span>Then some hack to expose someone or to leak information. For example, the group of hackers calling themselves “Anonymous,” who claim to have personal information about Donald Trump and were threatening to expose them. They are also threatening to reveal the “crimes” committed by the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) following the murder of George Floyd.</span></p><p><span>Another example is when tens of thousands of messages from hacked emails were leaked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s Gmail account. The list goes on and on, as hackers don’t cut to prove a point or to expose someone. They hack for political reasons, for money, or are driven by some purpose or motive.</span></p><p><span>All of these actions are deemed illegal and felonious under the Computer Misuse Act (1990) along with other legislative acts such as the Data Protection Act (2018) and The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>When Is Hacking Legal?</b></h2><p><span>Legal hacking is where the hacker is granted permission to hack into a system or network. This type of hacking is also known as Ethical Hacking. Since we live in a technological era, it has become easier for radical organizations to finance hackers to infiltrate security systems. This has resulted in a steady rise in cybercrime.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It has become imperative now more than ever for companies and governments to </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-legal-hacking#"><span>legally hack</span></a><span> into their operations to discover and fix vulnerabilities and prevent malicious and unlawful hacking from keeping the classified information safe. This type of hacking is done by either The White Hat Hackers or The Grey Hat Hackers.</span></p><p><span>The White Hat Hackers are those hackers who look for backdoors in the software when they are legally permitted to do so.</span></p><p><span>The Grey Hat Hackers are those hackers who are like Black Hat hackers but do not hack to cause any damage to any organization or people’s personal information or data. They are hired by companies or organizations to hack into their computer system and notify the administration if their order has any vulnerabilities. This is done so that these organizations can further secure their networks. Software companies make use of such hackers and hacking processes.</span></p><p><span>There are many types of ethical hacking. A few of them are</span></p><ul><li><span>Web Application Hacking,</span></li><li><span>System Hacking,</span></li><li><span>Web Server Hacking.</span></li></ul><h2><b>Commonly Used Hacking Techniques</b></h2><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?ssl=1"><img title="common hacking techniques black hat hackers grey hat hackers" src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=640%2C432&amp;ssl=1" alt="common hacking techniques black hat hackers grey hat hackers" width="640" height="432" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=640%2C432&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>Here are the most common hacking techniques used by hackers:</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>SQL Injection Attack</strong> – SQL stands for Structured Query Language. </span><span>It is a programming language originally invented to manipulate and manage data in software or databases.</span></li><li><span><strong>Distributed Denial – of – Service (DDoS)</strong> – This technique is used to target websites to flood them with more traffic than the server can handle.</span></li><li><span><strong>Keylogger</strong> – It is a software that documents the key sequence in a log file on a computer that may contain personal email I.D.s and passwords.

While criticizing the government, or even waving the wrong flag, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53244862">could get you imprisoned</a> in any territory under Chinese rule, your right to freedom of expression is sacrosanct under the First Amendment—until you step into your place of work, that is. While the government is not entitled to punish political dissent, in most parts of America it is perfectly legal for your boss to fire you if they happen to dislike the person you voted for in the last election. </p><div><p>This restriction on political expression is especially harmful at a time when, nearly every day, somebody is accused of having transgressed against some commonly (or even not so commonly) held taboo. In many of these cases, employees—from senior staff at prominent institutions to working-class laborers—have been fired. Even outside of working hours, it would now be perfectly reasonable for most Americans to think twice before speaking their minds about hot-button issues.</p><p> In their attempts to remedy the most pernicious aspects of cancel culture, critics have mostly concentrated on advocating less punitive social norms. This is good as far as it goes. Our political culture will only become more liberal if we all stop demanding that people be punished or fired for imaginary transgressions. Yet, this emphasis on culture ignores the important role that legislative reform could play in defending the most vulnerable: If it were harder for employers to fire people for frivolous reasons, Americans would have less reason to fear that expressing their views might cost them their livelihoods.</p></div><p><strong>The Problem with At-Will Employment</strong></p><p>At the moment, most American workers are subject to “at-will” contracts. As long as their employers do not fire them on the basis of a narrow set of protected characteristics, such as gender, race, and sexual orientation, they can lose their jobs at any time, for any reason. Nor is there a due process requirement: Companies are under no legal obligation to investigate whether the ostensible reasons for axing an employee are grounded in reality. (The only state that categorically prohibits at-will employment, after six months on the job, <a href="https://spoonlaw.com/437-2/">is Montana</a>). </p><div><p> The prevalence of at-will employment makes it easier for employers to engage in knee-jerk reactions to short-lived social media controversies. For instance, a Hispanic electrician working for the San Diego Gas and Electric company was fired for cracking his knuckles in a photograph because a <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/">social media mob believed that he was</a> flashing a white power sign. The man who took the picture has since admitted that he probably misinterpreted the interaction, and thousands of people have now <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sdge-reinstate-emmanuel-caffertys-job-sdge">signed a petition</a>, asking the electrician’s former employer to reverse the mistake. But since the employee has already lost his job, it will be hard for him to obtain justice. As in many other cases, both parties would have been better off if the law had required the company to afford due process to an accused worker <em>before</em> deciding whether or not to fire him. </p><p> There is a better alternative: Contracts negotiated by labor unions often provide so-called “just cause” protections for employees. The tests of just cause <a href="https://www.massnurses.org/labor-action/labor-education-resources/grievances-101/just-cause#:~:text=Just%20cause%20is%20the%20standard,must%20be%20just%20and%20fair.&amp;text=The%20concept%20of%20just%20cause%20is%20well%20established%20in%20labor%20law.">typically include questions</a> such as whether the employee was forewarned of the consequences of his or her actions, whether the rules were applied evenly, and whether there was an objective investigation into the employee’s conduct. In other words, it forces employers to conduct a fair process before firing their employees, which gives the accused a real chance to defend themselves. If we really care about free speech and due process, these protections should be available to every American.</p></div><div><p>Opponents of these reforms have long argued that they would come at a heavy cost to the economy. But scholars who have studied the impact of wrongful discharge protections have obtained mixed results. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w12860.pdf">One 2007 study of U.S. employers</a>, for example, found that the introduction of such protections resulted in some loss of productivity, but also led to strong growth in overall employment numbers.</p></div><p><strong>Stop Employers From Discriminating Against Views They Don’t Like</strong></p><p> Just cause legislation would help to reduce the number of capricious firings. But, as long as bosses can legally terminate employees because they dislike their political views, such legislation would only go partway towards remedying the chilling effects on free speech. That’s why those of us who worry about cancel culture should also push for the inclusion of political affiliation in the rubric of anti-discrimination laws. </p><p> The Civil Rights Act has long prohibited employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, or national origin. In June, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees">ruled that this provision</a> also protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees. But there are no equivalent federal protections to prevent employees from being disadvantaged because of their political views.</p><div><p>This is a missed opportunity, as the success of local ordinances mandating such protections has shown. In Washington D.C., for example, the <a href="https://ohr.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ohr/publication/attachments/LawsAndRegs-HumanRightsAct-1977-English.pdf">Human Rights Act</a> prohibits employment discrimination based on political affiliation, defined as “the state of belonging to or endorsing any political party.” As Edgar Njatou, Executive Director of Workplace Fairness, told me in an interview, this ensures that your boss can’t fire you if they “find out you voted for Hillary or that you’re a Republican.”</p><p> Seattle has even more ambitious protections for workers’ political views. Its laws prohibit discrimination based on “<a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT14HURI_CH14.06UNPUACPR&amp;showChanges=true">political ideology</a>,” which is defined as “any idea or belief … relating to the purpose, conduct, organization, function or basis of government institutions and activities, whether or not characteristic of any political party or group.” But even this law mostly serves to protect people with relatively common political views. After the 2016 election, for example, local rental listings began to discourage Trump supporters from applying. “If you are a landlord,” city government spokesperson Elliot Bronstein, <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/no-trump-clause-is-new-requirement-for-some-seattle-renters/416269805">wrote in response</a>, “you cannot discriminate on political status.” (Like other protections against discrimination, this does not apply to housemates, who share an apartment or living space.) </p></div><p>There are two obvious objections—both of which could easily be addressed. First, some organizations have a legitimate interest in ensuring that their employees share a broad worldview: It would make no sense, for example, to stop a political campaign group from discriminating against a job applicant who opposes the organization’s goals. Explicitly political organizations should therefore enjoy a carve-out from the stricture against discriminating on the basis of political beliefs (though they would still have to afford existing employees the due process protections guaranteed under “just cause” provisions). </p><p>Second, employers have a legitimate interest in protecting their staff from the hateful conduct of colleagues: Clearly, for example, no member of an ethnic minority should have to endure racist taunts at their place of work. But this could also be addressed through carefully worded legislation. Seattle already offers exemptions for political conduct that would cause “substantial and material disruption of the property rights of the provider of a place of public accommodation.” Employers also have an affirmative obligation to protect employees from racist harassment.</p><p>Balancing competing goods is one of the core purposes of any legal system. There is no reason to think that our laws could not protect the speech of political minorities, without hampering the operation of overtly political organizations or burdening ethnic, religious, or sexual minorities with the fear of harassment.</p><p><strong>We Can Make It Happen</strong></p><p>New employment regulations always face an especially tough uphill battle in Congress. But, though it will not be easy to win legislative approval for such reforms, every major faction of American political life has its own reasons for supporting them. </p><p>The left should be sympathetic to the wish to expand job protections for American workers, which lag significantly behind those of other developed countries. While conservatives are usually hostile to such regulations, they should recognize that these reforms would help to protect them against the growing influence of cancel culture.

<p>There is currently a lot of discussion around Signal’s new <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-pins/">PIN</a> decisions. In particular, the discussions have focused on the decision to use the PIN as a seed to encrypt backup data that will be stored on Signal servers using Secure Value Recovery (SVR). So user data will be stored in a way so that even Signal cannot access it. SVR uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">Intel SGX</a> to ensure this.</p>
<p>This week there was <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/07/10/a-few-thoughts-about-signals-secure-value-recovery/">an excellent post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green">Matthew Green</a>, a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University, where he discussed some of the concerns he has with Signal’s SVR system, especially around SGX. He also touched on the rollout methods and delivery Signal has used to communicate this new feature. It’s an excellent breakdown and I can’t effectively summarize it here, I highly recommend reading it.</p>
<p>(To <em>ineffectively</em> summarize it however, SGX isn’t foolproof and has had issues in the past. Signal is pushing this hard on users without a lot of context or easily understood options for disabling SVR.)</p>
<p>Matthew’s criticisms are all valid and I don’t disagree at all. But I want to add something to the discussion that is being mostly omitted – the network effect of a messaging app, and the considerations Moxie and Signal have to take into consideration to effectively secure your and my communications.</p>
<p>Signal must take into account multiple users accessing identical data as a first-class concern. Every communication you have on Signal must be decrypted by an endpoint you don’t control – the device of the person you’re messaging. A similar use case is email. Hypothetically, let’s say you avoid Google like the plague. Even then, approximately 50% of your email will still reside on Google servers due to your recipients using either Gmail or G Suite.</p>
<p>As Signal is a closed(ish) ecosystem, unlike email, they have to deal with this concern too. Not only do they have to make sure that the security on your endpoint is as strong as possible, but they also have to make sure the same is true of the other endpoints where you’re sending data.</p>
<p>In this situation Signal has to consider that doing what many suggest and making SVR as an opt-in, or not offering at all will likely <em>reduce</em> adoption by a broader userbase, who want things like contact syncing, and easy backups. So while adding user choice may make <em>my</em> data storage more secure, the fact that it hurts adoption means a smaller percentage of my communications will be end-to-end encrypted at all because they’ll go over channels like Slack, email, or SMS.</p>
<p>It is worth keeping in mind that Signal is maintaining not only an application, but an ecosystem, and the security considerations must take both areas into account. It is better, in my mind, to have a goal of really good security on the majority of my communications, as opposed to exceptional security on just some of my communications. And Signal has always been a secure messaging player in the consumer and non-expert space, as opposed to something like Keybase which targets more knowledgeable users and makes different tradeoffs accordingly.</p>
<p>As Matt says in his post, criticizing Signal is difficult as their overall work is great, and I’m glad the criticism and discussion are happening. We should continue to hold them to a high standard. But the network effects and ecosystem should be considered as much as the application and security architecture. If they aren’t then we risk repeating the mistakes of PGP email where we have an amazingly secure system that is rarely used in practice.</p>

July 16, 2020 | https://burgers.io/cross-compile-rust-from-arm-to-x86-64 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://burgers.io/cross-compile-rust-from-arm-to-x86-64">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
			<p>It’s 2020. The world is abuzz with, well – <em>waves hand</em> – all this. But it's
also abuzz with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>: Apple is moving their Mac line to Apple Silicon, Amazon
has been been touting their Gravaton2-based infrastructure, Cloudflare is said
to be going all ARM on their edge nodes, and the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15869/new-1-supercomputer-fujitsus-fugaku-and-a64fx-take-arm-to-the-top-with-415-petaflops">world's fastest supercomputer
is built on ARM</a>.</p>
<p>For a long time, I – and I think many others – held the idea that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64</a> is
for heavy workloads and ARM is for the "little stuff" like embedded systems and
Raspberry Pis.</p>
<p>And that’s why you can find tons of articles online for how to cross-compile
Rust <em>from</em> x86-64 <em>to</em> ARM.</p>
<p>I want to cross-compile the other way.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://zenlist.com/">Zenlist</a>, we use Rust to run our entire fleet of lambdas (around 90 of
them).</p>
<p>Amazon has been talking up their beefy Gravaton2-based ARM instances. But right
now, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">lambda</a> – which feels to me like the "little stuff" because of their
low-memory/low-CPU settings – only runs on x86-64.</p>
<p>I decided we needed to figure out how to build our lambda runtimes from an ARM
server: I needed to cross-compile Rust <em>from</em> ARM <em>to</em> x86-64.</p>
<hr>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>I launched two Ubuntu 20.04 instances: a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c6/">c6g.medium</a> for the build
machine and a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t3/">t3.micro</a> as an x86-64 to run the results on. (Cut me some
slack here! Including how to compile and run on lambda would make this article
quite a bit longer!)</p>
<p>Log into that build machine and lets get started. A quick visit to <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup.rs</a>
to install Rust, of course.</p>
<p>And a <code>apt-get install -y build-essential</code> for all of the other tools we need.</p>
<p>And finally,</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new --bin crossed
$ cargo run
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>gets a nice little greeting printed the to the screen. We're in business!</p>
<h2>Cross compile!</h2>
<p>Alright, so now we want to cross compile this admittedly awesome project to run
on the target machine.</p>
<p>We'll start in the usual place: adding a new target.</p>
<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre>
<p>On lambda, it's nice to use the <code>musl</code> target to get everything statically
linked together.</p>
<p>Alright, let's give it a try.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1
</code></pre>
<p>Well bummer. I was really hoping that would Just Work™. No need to panic yet,
because I remember from reading other articles like <a href="https://rendered-obsolete.github.io/2019/03/19/rust_lambda.html">Rust on
Lambda</a> and <a href="https://sigmaris.info/blog/2019/02/cross-compiling-rust-on-mac-os-for-an-arm-linux-router/">Cross compiling Rust on Mac OS for an ARM
Linux router</a> that we probably just need to configure a
cross-compiling linker.</p>
<p>Alright, so we need to install a cross compiler.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install gcc-x86-64-linux-gnu
</code></pre>
<p>Then we need to set it up by throwing this in <code>~/.cargo/config</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
linker = "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc"
</code></pre>
<p>And now, <code>cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code> works
great!</p>
<h2>And it works on the target machine, right?</h2>
<p>Well, I had better make sure. That's why I spun up the target machine, after
all.</p>
<pre><code>$ scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/crossed ubuntu@target-machine:.
$ ssh ubuntu@target-machine ./crossed
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>🎉🏆</p>
<h2>The author counts his chickens before they hatch</h2>
<p>So that's how to cross-compile for x86-64 lambda from an ARM machine! Publish
this post. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/submit-URLs">Submit the sitemap to Google</a>. Actually, hey, we can
probably do that right from this project!</p>
<p>I'll just add <a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest">reqwest</a> to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.10", default-features = false, features = ["rustls-tls", "blocking"] }
</code></pre>
<p>And write up some quick code to notify Google that my sitemap has changed, and
it should index this clearly-complete-and-not-missing-anything article.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::default();
    let url = "http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://burgers.io/sitemap.xml";
    let status = client.get(url)
        .send()?
        .status();

    println!("{:?}", status);

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>And cross-compile it while I get a celebratory drink.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.15`
</code></pre>
<h2>Wait, what?</h2>
<p>Everything was sailing along so smoothly! What happened?</p>
<p>Not-rust happened.</p>
<p>I told <em>Cargo</em> about my cross-compiler. But <a href="https://docs.rs/ring">ring</a> – a crypto library that
reqwest uses – uses some code that isn't Rust, and it had no way to know about
my cross compiler.</p>
<p>Let's take a longer look at more of the error log.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.15`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `/home/ubuntu/crossed/target/release/build/ring-082dc03a36bb5ba5/build-script-build` (exit code: 101)
--- stdout
OPT_LEVEL = Some("3")
TARGET = Some("x86_64-unknown-linux-musl")
HOST = Some("aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu")
CC_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl = None
CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl = None
TARGET_CC = None
CC = None
CROSS_COMPILE = None
CFLAGS_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl = None
CFLAGS_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl = None
TARGET_CFLAGS = None
CFLAGS = None
CRATE_CC_NO_DEFAULTS = None
DEBUG = Some("false")
CARGO_CFG_TARGET_FEATURE = Some("fxsr,sse,sse2")
</code></pre>
<p>Yep, yep, looks good, target is <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code>, host is
<code>aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>, uh huh, yep, <strong>oh</strong>.</p>
<p>That's interesting.</p>
<p>There's an environment variable there – <code>CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl</code> – that
looks like it's expecting the exact cross-compiler to use. And it's empty.</p>
<p>Well, let's change that! Using the exact same cross-compiler that we specified
in the cargo config, let's set that environment variable.</p>
<pre><code>$ export CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc
</code></pre>
<p>And then 🤞.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre>
<p>It worked! Throw it over to the target machine and give it a try!</p>
<pre><code>$ scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/crossed ubuntu@target-machine:.
$ ssh ubuntu@target-machine ./crossed
200
</code></pre>
<p>Nice.</p>
<h2>Some final notes</h2>
<p>As bullet points? Why not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure <code>CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl</code> is permanently in your environment
somehow. For us, this involved adding it to the environment section for
self-hosted GitHub runners.</li>
<li>In my specific testing for our specific projects, compilation times were up
to about 10% slower than on a corresponding <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/">c5</a> instance. But the cost
tradeoff was worth it.</li>
<li>I'm holding out hope that AWS will give us ARM-based lambdas in the future.</li>
<li>No instances were harmed while writing this article. Well, except the ones I
terminated. Which reminds me to remind you: if you were following along at
home, now might be a good time to terminate your instances.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A really powerful tool in Computer Aided Design (CAD) is the ability to apply
<em>“constraints”</em> to your drawing. Constraints are a really powerful tool,
allowing the drafter to declare how parts of their drawing are related, then
letting the CAD program figure out how parameters can be manipulated in such
a way that</p><p>You can think of a constraint as some sort of mathematical relationship between
two or more parameters.</p><p>Some examples are:</p><ul><li><em>“This interior angle is 45°”</em></li><li><em>“That line is vertical”</em></li><li><em>“Side A is perpendicular to side B”</em></li></ul><p>Graphically they’ll be displayed something like this:</p><figure><a href="http://solvespace.com/constraints.pl"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solvespace/solvespace-web/dc2f3ed070d58eb827617633cd4bdc52b8c0ba00/pics/constraints-triangle-dim-2.png" alt="A constrained triangle in SolveSpace"></a><figcaption><p>A constrained triangle in <a href="http://solvespace.com/">SolveSpace</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>These constraints are declared mathematically, so a <em>“This line is vertical”</em>
constraint may be written as $line.start.x - line.end.x = 0$ and
$line.start.z - line.end.z = 0$ (assuming the $x$ axis is to the right and
the $z$ comes out of the page).</p><p>In response to input from the user (e.g. they click on the line and drag it
to the left), a constraint system will feed the perturbation into the system
of equations (e.g. the $line.start.y$ changes by $-0.1$ units) and based on
the available constraints and tie-breaking heuristics, it will figure out how
much each remaining variable must change. Execute at 60 FPS and you’ve got an
interactive, parametric CAD application.</p><p>A constraint solver is a fairly complex system, but the first step is teaching
it how to manipulate and evaluate abstract maths.</p><div><p>The code written in this article is available <a href="https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/constraints">on GitHub</a>. Feel free to
browse through and steal code or inspiration.</p><p>If you found this useful or spotted a bug, let me know on the blog’s
<a href="https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/adventures.michaelfbryan.com">issue tracker</a>!</p></div><h2 id="the-expression-tree">The Expression Tree</h2><p>For this constraint solver we need a way to represent algebraic expressions like
$x - 5$ or $sin(x) + y*y - x*y$, and the most natural form is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><em>Abstract
Syntax Tree</em></a>.</p><p>In this language, an expression can be:</p><ul><li>A (possibly unnamed) parameter</li><li>A floating-point constant</li><li>A call to a function with a single argument</li><li>Negation, and</li><li>A binary operation (e.g. <code>x + y</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>
operands, and we’re using the <code>+</code> operator)</li></ul><p>Our constraint solver is considerably less complex than a general purpose
programming language, so most of our <em>Abstract Syntax Tree</em> can fit into a
couple simple types.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// src/expr.rs

I’d like to direct your attention to two details…</p><ol><li>Text fields use a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/smol_str"><code>smol_str::SmolStr</code></a>
instead of a normal <code>String</code></li><li>Each child node is behind a reference-counted pointer</li></ol><p>We’re using <code>SmolStr</code> for something called the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10315041/meaning-of-acronym-sso-in-the-context-of-stdstring/10319672#10319672"><em>Small String Optimisation</em></a>.
This is where small amounts of text can be stored inline on the stack (in place
of the data pointer, length, and capacity fields in a normal <code>String</code>) to skip
a heap allocation and a layer of indirection.</p><p>The small string optimisation is useful when you’re dealing with a large
number of small strings (like programming language identifiers) because it
helps avoid heap fragmentation and locality. Cloning a <code>SmolStr</code> is also
quite cheap because even if it isn’t small, a reference-counted string
(analogous to <code>Arc&lt;str&gt;</code>) is used when we need to store large strings on the
heap.</p><p>A conscious design decision is to <em>make the AST immutable</em>. Most operations
applied to an <code>Expression</code> will leave part of the tree unchanged, and seeing
as we already <em>need</em> to add a layer of indirection to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25296195/why-are-recursive-struct-types-illegal-in-rust">prevent infinitely
sized types</a>, we can use reference-counted pointers to share
common sub-expressions.</p><p>This should reduce memory usage and hopefully increase performance because
shared nodes are more likely to be in cache.</p><h2 id="pretty-printing-and-other-useful-methods">Pretty-Printing and Other Useful Methods</h2><p>To make our <code>Expression</code> type easier to work with we can implement several
traits from the standard library.</p><p>Arguably the most useful of these is <code>std::fmt::Display</code>, a mechanism for
getting the <code>Expression</code>'s human-readable form.</p><h3 id="writing-the-display-implementation">Writing the Display Implementation</h3><p>To help make writing parentheses and spaces in <code>Display</code> a bit easier, let’s
create a temporary type for handling operator precedence.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// src/expr.rs

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>We have learned real inner product very well in high school or college. However, when it comes to sophisticated inner product and inner product space, such as complex inner product and complex inner product space, sometimes it is confusing.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the inner product, inner product space, and a definition discrepancy that sometimes people ignored.</p>

<h3 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space</h3>

<h4 id="vector-space">Vector Space</h4>

<p>In case someone does not know what vector space, it was defined clearly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#Definition">Wikipedia</a> and it was not hard to understand. The only caveat is probably that in addition to the conventional valued vector space, function space is also a vector space.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product">Inner Product</h4>

<p>An inner product (also called a dot product or scalar product) on a complex vector space $\mathbb{V}$ is a function</p>



<p>that satisfies the following four properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$\langle v_1 + v_2, w \rangle = \langle v_1, w \rangle + \langle v_2, w \rangle$ for all $v_1, v_2, w \in \mathbb{V}$</li>
  <li>$\langle cv, w \rangle = c \langle v, w \rangle$ for all $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$</li>
  <li>$\langle w, v \rangle = \overline{ \langle v, w \rangle }$ for all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$</li>
  <li>$\langle v, v \rangle$ is a positive real number for any $v \in \mathbb{V} \sim \{0\}$</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that there is discrepancy on the property 2. Some people defined the property 2 to be $\langle cv, w \rangle = \overline{c}\langle v, w \rangle$ for all $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$. The difference would affect the definition of the inner product space. Many people were not aware of this definition difference and made mistakes sometimes. For inner product of real numbers, there is no such discrepancy since $c = \overline{c}$ for any $c \in \mathbb{R}$.</p>

<h4 id="derived-inner-product-properties">Derived Inner Product Properties</h4>

<p>Based on the four inner product properties, we could further derive more inner product properties.</p>



<p>$\langle v, w_1 + w_2 \rangle = \langle v, w_1 \rangle + \langle v, w_2 \rangle$ for all $v, w_1, w_2 \in \mathbb{V}$</p>



<p>This is because</p>



<p>$\langle v, cw \rangle = \overline{c} \langle v, w \rangle$ for all $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$</p>



<p>This is because</p>



<p>Note that $\overline{ab} = \overline{a}\overline{b}$ and this could be easily verified.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-space">Inner Product Space</h4>

<p>An inner product space is a vector space along with an inner product.</p>



<p>This sounds awkward. But it is just literally a vector space with an inner product expression defined.</p>



<p>For example, we have the following complex inner product space.</p>



<p>Given vector space $\mathbb{C}^n$, we have two vectors $v = \{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n\}, w = \{w_1, w_2, \cdots, w_n\} \in \mathbb{C}^n$, the inner product is defined as</p>



<p>Note that the above inner product definition was defined given the property 2 of inner product was defined as $\langle cv, w \rangle = c \langle v, w \rangle$.</p>



<p>If the the property 2 of inner product was defined as $\langle cv, w \rangle = \overline{c}\langle v, w \rangle$, then the above inner product definition would become</p>



<p>This discrepancy also extends to other complex inner product spaces such as for $\mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, etc.</p>



<p>We would see, probably in my future blogs, that we have such different inner product definitions under different inner product properties is to satisfy some special properties of Hermitian matrix, so that some mathematical conclusions would be unified regardless of which way you defined the property 2 of inner product.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Always pay close attention to the definitions in mathematics.</p>

July 15, 2020 | https://rmpr.xyz/Migrating-from-Twitter-to-Mastodon/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rmpr.xyz/Migrating-from-Twitter-to-Mastodon/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Straight from their main page: “Mastodon is an open source decentralized social network”, 
so it’s basically the project <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky">Bluesky</a> but already implemented 
(Without the ads yay). More specifically, it’s a bunch of small (compared to the whole thing) independent 
communities which can interact with each other. You can find more information about Mastodon and 
how it works in the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/">documentation</a>.</p>


<p>To create an account on Mastodon, you need to register to an instance (which can be self-hosted). 
Go straight to <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">joinmastodon</a>, you have the most popular instances, 
<img src="https://rmpr.xyz/images/joinmastodon.png" alt="Mastodon Most Popular Instances"></p>

<p>You can select one instance, depending on your interests or whatever, note that it’s not 
critical because you can always switch from one instance to another almost seemlessly.</p>

<p><img src="https://rmpr.xyz/images/signup-mastodon.png" alt="Sign up Mastodon"></p>


<p>After email confirmation and a successful login to your newly created account, you’re 
prompted with a little tutorial about how it works, TL;DR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can talk to anyone on any server</li>
  <li>Tweet = Toot, Like = Favourite, Retweet = Boost, Reply = … Reply</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://rmpr.xyz/images/mastodon-tutorial.jpg" alt="Mastodon Tutorial"></p>

<h2 id="finding-who-to-follow">Finding who to follow</h2>
<p>Depending on the server you ended up choosing, you’re automatically following the 
administrators of the instance, if you’re lucky, they already toot (let’s use the 
actual jargon) about interesting subjects for you, In any case, you’ll quickly find 
the need to follow people more aligned with your interest, not only on your instance, 
there’s <a href="https://communitywiki.org/trunk">Trunk</a> which allows you to follow a bunch 
of people organized by Lists.</p>

<p>Going through this manually can be very tedious because in order to follow someone not 
on the same instance, you must enter your username and your domain, sometimes 
reauthenticate you mastodon account, just to follow someone! Fortunately, there’s a 
script called <a href="https://github.com/lots-of-things/pytrunk">pytrunk</a> which handles this 
gracefully, among others, it lets you check who on the lists are still active and how 
many followers they each have, and you only need to input your information once. By 
default it only works with Chrome, I had to <a href="https://github.com/RMPR/pytrunk">tweak it</a>
a little bit to make it work with chromium.</p>

<h2 id="setting-a-bridge-to-twitter">Setting a bridge to Twitter</h2>
<p>If for one reason or another, you don’t want to delete your Twitter account, you can 
use <a href="https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/">Crossposter</a> to link Mastodon to Twitter</p>

<p><img src="https://rmpr.xyz/images/crossposter-mastodon-twitter.png" alt="Crossposter Mastodon to Twitter"></p>

<p>It’s fairly straightforward, you just enter your accounts information, tweak the parameters 
if you’re not satisfied with the defaults, and you’re set.</p>


<p>There are <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps">several mobile clients</a> to access Mastodon, the 
most popular on Android being:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tateisu/SubwayTooter">SubwayTooter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky">Tusky</a> (my daily driver)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/stom79/Fedilab">Fedilab</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Mastodon is just one of a community of federated platforms services built around the
ActivityPub protocol (among others, but currently the most widely adopted). Other open source 
social protocols can also communicate with ActivityPub projects. All together, they’re 
forming the <a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse</a> = “Federation” + “universe”</p>

<p>I got access the the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI GPT-3 API</a> and I have to say I’m blown away. It’s far more coherent than any AI language system I’ve ever tried. All you have to do is write a prompt and it’ll add text it thinks would plausibly follow. I’ve gotten it to write songs, stories, press releases, guitar tabs, interviews, essays, technical manuals. It’s hilarious and frightening. I feel like I’ve seen the future and that full AGI might not be too far away.</p>



<p>In each case below bold is the prompt I provided GPT-3, and the rest is all generated by the AI. In some cases I had to click generate a few times, and in about 2/3 of the examples I picked the best example after a few tries, but I generally didn’t have work too hard to get it to write amazingly coherent text given a simple prompts. Here are some of my favorites. </p>

<p><strong>Below is a screenplay for a film-noir hard boiled detective story by Raymond Chandler about the boy wizard Harry Potter:</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Harry Potter”</strong><br><strong>By Raymond Chandler</strong></p>



<p>Harry Potter, Private Eye.<br>Scene: A small dingy office, early morning, furniture of the Salvation Army store variety. Sordid atmosphere. Harry Potter, in ratty tweed suit, unpressed shirt, and unshined shoes, sits behind the desk looking haggard, rumpled, and embittered. In one corner of the office a torn shade rattles at the wind gusts outside. Harry has one long index finger on the butt of a .38 and he broods over a photograph. The photograph shows a gorgeous blonde wearing an evening gown. She is holding a cocktail in one hand and looking pensively at a cigarette in the other. A tear adorns her cheek. Harry looks at her for a long moment, sighs, then puts his gun down and stands. He straightens his clothes, scratches his head, then with more resolution turns around, picks up his pistol, and leaves the office. He passes through the front room and looks out the dirty window. An old woman is washing the sidewalk outside with a mop. A young man in a double breasted gray suit is leaning against the building. Harry sighs again and goes out the door. He walks up to the young man and without ceremony punches him in the jaw.</p>



<p><strong>Press Release: Anaheim, CA: President Kanye West declares Disney Land to be the new capital of the United States. Washington D.C. will be maintained as a museum.</strong><br>The move has been in the works since the mid-2000’s. <br>Advertisement <br>*2. Removes his sunglasses, revealing that he is no longer in any way blinded. <br>*3. Endorsed by Senator Kid Rock, who has also declared this new government of Disneyland will be paying for his divorce.<br>*4. An elaborate surgery will take place to repair Kanye’s “Diamond Tiara” tattoo, and reposition it to his forehead so that he can legally be recognized as a Princess. <br>Advertisement <br>*5. Joe Rogan has been picked to be the new Drug Czar. <br>“It’s long been established I’ve been Kanye’s gateway drug, so why not put me in a position of power,” Rogan said, clearly relishing his new position. “I have an in-depth understanding of the ways in which recreational drug use enhances one’s experience of life. I am deeply passionate about getting drugs to kids.” <br>*6. Kardashian sisters will no longer be known as The Kardashians. The family will change its name to The Wests. <br>*7. Kanye West’s new sports bra will no longer be known as a sports bra. It will be officially recognized as The West Bandit. <br>Advertisement <br>*8. President Kanye will announce that he has a new national anthem. The government-mandated anthem will be a modified version of Kanye’s 2007 hit “Stronger.” It will be played on a continuous loop at all times.</p>

<p><strong>Blood Song</strong><br><strong>By HP Lovecraft</strong></p>



<p><strong>The creeping chaos Nyarlathotep walks upon the earth while in his House at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming. After eight seaons on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23TeamDaenerys">#TeamDaenerys</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyarlathotep is quite irritated with what he feels is a very hackneyed ending to Game of Thrones.</strong></p>



<p>On the third day of season eight, Nyarlathotep looks down upon his television and utters&nbsp;“What&nbsp;the hell are they doing?”At this point, Nyarlathotep goes on a long tirade about how the Starks were supposed to be there at the end. Instead we have Daenerys looking like she is going to set everything on fire. He tells his cult of followers that Daenerys’ actions are completely nonsensical and that it is completely disrespectful to not finish a story with all its main characters alive. He mentions that they should just burn down Winterfell because it makes no sense for her to even be there. It would make more sense if she flew in with Drogon and just burned King’s Landing. His followers start to get nervous when Nyarlathotep mentions he has always liked Cersei.</p>



<p><strong>Below is a pop song by Taylor Swift about the boy Wizard Harry Potter. </strong></p>

<p>Harry’s got glasses <br>He’s got those bright green eyes <br>Girls are always screaming </p>



<p>‘Cause he’s got that Potter hair </p>



<p>Even when he’s super stressed <br>He’s still got those supersonic cheekbones <br>I’m not surprised they made a movie </p>



<p>‘Cause I’d watch him anytime <br>Oh, yeah, Harry, baby, you’re my favorite character </p>



<p>I’d walk a thousand miles </p>



<p>To get to see you and </p>

<p>I’d love to be your girl </p>



<p><strong>The following is an essay by Paul Graham on paulgraham.com on how to make Mars a startup hub</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Startups On Mar</strong>s<br><strong>By Paul Graham</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the sort of startup that might make a go of it on Mars:<br>One that makes money by taking advantage of local resources. For example, a startup that uses the Martian atmosphere to make fertilizer or methane fuel. A startup that sells water from Martian rivers. A startup that uses minerals from the Martian soil. A startup that uses solar power from the Martian sun. A startup that uses a new kind of solar panel that’s more efficient at converting sunlight into electricity.<br>I would even invest in a startup that did nothing but extract the helium-3 from the Martian atmosphere and send it back to Earth.<br>If you can find a way to make money by using local resources, there’s probably a business there.<br>There’s another class of startups that might work on Mars:<br>Startups that produce services for other startups. For example, a startup that makes it easier to build rockets, or to extract gases from the Martian atmosphere, or to construct solar panels, or to farm the local soil.<br>Startups that make things more comfortable for colonists. For example, a startup that sells air conditioners, or houses. A startup that sells things to keep colonists entertained. A startup that provides Internet services.</p>



<p><strong>The following is a blog post from Slate Star Codex about the value of free speech and civility in a democratic society.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</strong><br><strong>By Scott Alexander</strong></p>



<p>I.<br>There’s a concept that comes up often in debates about free speech called&nbsp;“shouting&nbsp;fire in a crowded theater”. The basic idea is that you can’t just say whatever you want whenever you want – especially if it’s likely to cause panic. And the reason for this is obvious: panic leads to violence, and violence hurts people. If you are causing panic, then your right to free speech ends where the other person’s right to not get hurt begins.<br>But this isn’t really true. If shouting fire in a crowded theater were illegal, then there wouldn’t be any actual fires in theaters, would there? How could there be? If everyone knew that shouting fire …</p></div></div>

<p>There are hyperclouds and there are hyperclowns. Hyperclouds have globe-spanning infrastructure upon which they lavish many billions of dollars every year. Hyperclowns pursue a far more asset-light approach to the same problem, but try to compensate with hot air.</p>



<p>It has been just over two years since we <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2018/05/follow-the-capex-separating-the-clowns-from-the-clouds/">last checked in</a> on self-proclaimed public cloud powerhouses IBM and Oracle. Are they closing the gap with the hyperclouds? Have their capital expenditures (CAPEX) on cloud infrastructure (datacenters, CPU cores by the million, transoceanic cables, etc.) caught up with their bombast, never mind the actual hyperclouds? How secure is their hyperclown status?</p>



<h2><strong>IBM</strong></h2>



<p>Since our last installment, IBM chose to spend $34 billion buying Red Hat instead of spending it on CAPEX. Needless to say, we are disappointed. And for <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2019/07/a-very-cold-take-on-ibm-red-hat-and-their-hybrid-cloud-hyperbole/">what</a>? An increasingly proprietary Kubernetes distribution? A not-so-scarce asset that the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/">CNCF</a> trumpets as one of “over 90 certified Kubernetes offerings”? Spending $34 billion on CAPEX would have edged out Amazon ($31.95 billion) in 2019. So how much did IBM spend on CAPEX?</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-58.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-58.png 556w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-58-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px"></figure>



<p><strong>2019 was the year IBM simply gave up even pretending to compete in cloud.</strong> Expect <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/ibm-confirms-layoffs-are-happening-but-wont-provide-details/">stealth layoffs</a> (a rare discipline where IBM is still best in class) and lots of multi hybrid private hosted Watson blockchain cloudwashing from here out from the company.</p>



<h2><strong>Oracle</strong></h2>



<p>Oracle, meanwhile, was on a roll last we <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2018/05/follow-the-capex-separating-the-clowns-from-the-clouds/">looked</a>. They had a nice hockey stick going, tripling their CAPEX spend over the previous five years. The press tell us Oracle is putting the <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/oracle/oracle-cloud-puts-data-center-expansion-pedal-metal">“pedal to the metal”</a> on infrastructure investment. Oracle Cloud is even getting some unexpected <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/what-the-is-happening-at-oracle-cloud/">plaudits</a> from pundits, particularly for network pricing (they don’t appear to own any network themselves so this cost presumably is a marketing line item). And, of course, they had 60,000 idle cores when Zoom came calling (though AWS was <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/most-zoom-runs-aws-not-oracle-says-aws/">quick to point out</a> that 60,000 cores is but chump change in an actual hypercloud’s couch).&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-59.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-59.png 573w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-59-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px"></figure>



<p><strong>Alas, Oracle’s CAPEX spending topped out in 2017</strong>. They’ve pulled back almost 20% since our last installment (the annual data above maps their quarter ending in February to the calendar year). Yet their marketing clamor has ratcheted up more than 20%, as Larry runs his time-honored strategy of picking a verbal fight with the market leader in hopes some kind of equivalence rubs off. CAPEX tells us several things about cloud businesses: whether you have actual customers, whether you’re ready for new customers, and how you’re keeping up with the competition. On all three counts, Oracle’s CAPEX tells us the company isn’t playing the hypercloud game.</p>



<h2><strong>Meanwhile in Cloud City</strong></h2>



<p>A cursory look suggests the hyperclouds continue to move up-and-to-the-right with their CAPEX investment while the hyperclowns are in a tight race to be the x-axis.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-60.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-60.png 529w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-60-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px"></figure>



<p>On a relative basis as a percentage of revenue, the hyperclowns also continue to lose ground.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-61.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-61.png 535w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-61-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px"></figure>



<h2><strong>New Clowns in Town</strong></h2>



<p>But IBM and Oracle shouldn’t get complacent about their hyperclown status, as there are some new entrants throwing their clown hats into the ring.</p>



<p>The announcement of “the world’s first financial services-ready public cloud” prompted an immediate check to see what kind of CAPEX was behind it. What did we see?</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-62.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-62.png 480w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-62-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></figure>



<p>This is not the CAPEX chart of a new public cloud player. It looks like the CAPEX of a company that migrated completely to someone else’s cloud in 2012. The chart belongs to Bank of America, who made the financials services cloud <a href="https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/press-releases/online-banking-and-technology/ibm-developing-worlds-first-financial-services-ready">announcement</a> in conjunction with IBM. It appears their effort is really just IBM Cloud with a very thin veneer (roughly the thickness of a press release) on top. Perhaps a face-saving cloud migration strategy for a bank that <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/cloud/bank-america-s-cloud-expansion-could-save-ton-money-ceo-says">previously</a> has been one of the most prominent remaining cloud hold-outs (and rumor has it the pandemic has increased the enthusiasm for cloud amongst other companies in the ever-shrinking group of hold-outs). It is interesting that Bank of America and IBM believe the financial services industry has a higher tolerance for unexplained <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/0840184b">outages</a> and opaque customer communication than other industries.</p>



<p>Since this is mostly an effort to obscure the IBM brand (not such a bad idea given their <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/02/ibms-lost-decade/">performance</a> over the last decade), and Bank of America’s CTO <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/bank-america-cto-howard-boville-head-ibms-cloud-division/">ran</a> off to lead IBM’s cloud “business” shortly thereafter, this particular cloud fantasy doesn’t yet warrant finding a new picture featuring a trio of clowns to grace the top of this post.</p>



<h2><strong>“The cradle of an open, transparent digital ecosystem</strong>…”</h2>



<p>But perhaps the most ambitious new effort of potentially epic hyperclown proportions comes from a newly formed Belgian non-profit: <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">GAIA-X</a>. Emboldened by their global success in inflicting trillions of “something, something, privacy” pop-up notices on unsuspecting web users (pay no attention to the actual <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190521/17425842255/one-year-into-gdpr-can-we-declare-it-total-failure-yet.shtml">consequences</a>), the French and German governments have decided it is time to “do something” about the cloud.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">From </a>the original Belgish:</p>



<blockquote><p>With GAIA-X, representatives from politics, business and science from France and Germany, together with other European partners, create a proposal for the next generation of a data infrastructure for Europe: a secure, federated system that meets the highest standards of digital sovereignty while promoting innovation. This project is the cradle of an open, transparent digital ecosystem, where data and services can be made available, collated and shared in an environment of trust</p></blockquote>



<p>This bottomless serving of word salad seems to boil down to defining a set of protocols that allow computers to exchange information (oddly, the word Internet never appears in the manifesto), but is well-tossed with a creamy dressing of GDPR and European “values” (which seem to have some strong <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1276604449616564224">Chinese influences</a> these days). Their audacious breakthrough is declaring CAPEX unnecessary. GAIA-X will magically federate the spare servers of the European continent into a digital infrastructure that can fend off the barbarian hypercloud horde and preserve European “digital sovereignty”.</p>



<p>Hyperclown status is best thought of as the ratio of cloud rhetoric to CAPEX spending. The most efficient hyperclowns maximize their marketing while minimizing actual spend. GAIA-X is <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/altmaier-charts-gaia-x-as-the-beginning-of-a-european-data-ecosystem/">reported</a> to have an annual budget of 1.5 million Euros ($1.71 million), which is characterized as “not huge, but sufficient.” Sufficient for what remains to be seen.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;advanced enterprise automated <strong>machine-learning platforms</strong> continue to evolve, data scientists are increasingly the hero figure of their organizations. From processing large volumes of a variety of numbers, such as operational and customer data, to credit data, consumer research, and third-party data sets, data scientists empower management and key stakeholders to make enhanced decisions with quantifiable, data-driven evidence. They’re even able to wrangle in and make sense of the typically chaotic data born of social media streams.</p>



<p>With flexible hybrid data as a service (DaaS) and big data as a service (BDaaS) solutions, <a href="https://shugert.com.mx/">data scientists</a> are able to access and process data on hosted solutions. This grants potent, real-time insights while also maintaining control and privacy of their exclusive on-premises data. With that, data scientists have had an easier time of controlling costs, eliminating certain advanced-data-analytics investments, including a range of business intelligence (BI) technologies and applications.</p>



<p>Despite enhanced machine-learning capabilities, new analytics tools, increased processing power, and stronger support infrastructures, data scientists still face mammoth challenges. The following discusses three of the top pain points of data science.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Too Much Post-Mortem and Not Enough Predictive Analytics</strong></h2>



<p>A majority of analytics today focuses on post-mortem examination, investigating old data to assess past events and why they happened. Descriptive analytics are used to guide future actions. For example, post-mortem data highlights helpful customer information such as gender, which particular product or service they bought or are subscribed to, and how many touch points they’ve had with customer service or account management. This allows businesses to build detailed customer profiles. With that data, for example, organizations can better decide on promotions for particular customers to reduce churn and improve retention.</p>



<p>However, descriptive analytics often fail to provide helpful customer data in a timely manner. Chances are a client who has churned out of an organization’s system and is now with their competitor because they weren’t properly serviced, optimally marketed, or upsold to, etc. In other words, customer profiles are only beneficial if you’re able to identify a customer as having that profile at the time you’re talking to them. That’s why <strong>predictive analytics</strong> are so important.</p>



<p><strong>Predictive analytics allows</strong> businesses to analyze the profiles that most often lead to churn, enabling them to act fast and retain more clients. You gain the capacity to identify the specific actions, transactions, touchpoints, and interactions that have a high probability of producing a specific outcome such as customer churn. Predictive analytics uncover these churn indicators in real or near-real time to tell you more accurately how and when to act.</p>



<h2><strong>2. Untouched Values and Inefficient Data Usage</strong></h2>



<p>Data analytics methods and tools too often analyze only numerical data, failing to investigate categorical values. Many organizations fail to recognize the value of fusing disjointed data, chaining together siloes to enhance cross-department communication and functionality. Without fused and normalized data, organizations are unable to extrapolate one department’s variables and apply to others. Comprehensive, collaborative data science has the ability to unearth universal variables that can be translated across departments to more efficiently optimize KPIs.</p>



<p>Free-form text and unstructured data represents another land of missed opportunity. Organizations fail to mine the gold that’s waiting to be found in email, social media, as well as customer service, account management, and sales calls.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Insufficient&nbsp;Accessibility and Expertise</strong></h2>



<p>Most organizations will agree that one of their top challenges is the retention of their data scientists. They’re one of the most sought-after, headhunted positions throughout data-driven industries. Organizations are often victim of vicious train-leave cycles, getting them up to speed on their unique operations just in time for them to be stolen for higher pay by a competitor.</p>



<p>And while today’s data science tools and platforms offer increasingly greater capabilities, even the drag-and-drop options require increasing data-science expertise to actually leverage solutions to their full potential.</p>



<p>Therefore, the combination of data-scientist-retention challenges and the growing data-science expertise needed to leverage top analytics tools has proven to be an intense problem for organizations.</p>



<p>To address the problem of data-scientist retention, more organizations are plugging their department managers into the equation. Yes, department managers are among the endpoints who need to actually put the data into action, applying it to their marketing, advertising, customer service, and operations decisions. But they simply don’t have the expertise required to adequately operate today’s increasingly complex data-science tools and platforms.</p>



<p>Comprehensive collaboration between experienced data scientists and department managers is the best approach. But since that’s not always an option, ease of use with data science tools is increasingly important. This has made intuitive web-based interfaces indispensible for countless organizations. With enhanced user friendliness, built-in data visualizations, and more flexible evaluation models, organizations are able to get the most from their in-house resources and make better sense of the data chaos flowing throughout and around their business.</p>

<p><em>After a protracted move to Portland (Oregon), I’m back to writing about parrots.</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Steve used to say to me, and he used to say this a lot. Hey Jony, here’s a dopey idea. And sometimes they were. Really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room. And they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones. Which in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound. </p><cite>Jony Ive, Steve Jobs memorial service, Apple Campus, 2011</cite></blockquote>



<p>One of the secrets of Apple’s success comes in this wonderful quote from Jony Ive. The part he didn’t mention—partly because it wasn’t relevant to the story—is that sometimes the magnificent ideas came out of the dopey ideas. </p>



<p>All of us are capable of bold, crazy, or magnificent ideas, but if we’re not allowed the freedom to have dopey ideas and voice them, some of these potential ideas may never come to fruition.</p>



<p>The more years I worked at Apple, the more timid I felt people had become to bring up ideas that they had. I finally figured out that it was likely due to the average tenure of an employee dropping dramatically as hiring went increased exponentially.</p>



<p>Someone that has been at Apple for 10 years is certainly very secure in voicing ideas, whereas someone that has only been there less than 2 years is understandably more reticent.</p>



<p>So, I don’t think Apple’s culture of being open to dopey ideas has changed, but the average employee is less likely to bring them up. I think this is probably true of any company that has experienced insane growth.</p>



<p>But back to dopey ideas.</p>



<p>Imagine being in a meeting with several people that each have dopey ideas. If no one says anything, nothing happens. But if one brings theirs up, it could either be combined with another dopey idea or tacked on to an existing good idea.</p>



<p>Perhaps the dopey idea sits on the back burner and simmers for years and then suddenly it becomes a brilliant idea because of the market or products changing.</p>



<p>If you work for Apple or any other company, be sure to encourage people to have dopey ideas and voice them. </p>



<p>Steve would want you to.</p>

<p>This program creates an integer counter protected by a mutex, spawns 10 threads, increments the counter 10 times from each thread, and prints the total.</p>
<p>The <code>counter</code> variable lives on the stack, and  a pointer to these stack data is shared with other threads.
The threads have to lock the mutex to do the increments.
When printing the total, the counter is read bypassing the mutex, without any synchronization.</p>
<p>The beauty of this program is that it relies on several bits of subtle reasoning for correctness, each of which is checked by compiler:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Child threads don’t escape the <code>main</code> function and so can read <code>counter</code> from its stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads only access <code>counter</code> through the mutex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads will have terminated by the time we read <code>total</code> out of <code>counter</code> without mutex.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If any of these constraints is broken, the compiler rejects the code.
There’s no need for <code>std::shared_ptr</code> just to defensively make sure that the memory isn’t freed under your feet.</p>
<p>Rust allows doing dangerous, clever, and fast things without fear of introducing undefined behavior.</p>
<p>If you like what you see, here are two books I recommend for diving deeper into Rust:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>Over the month, the Netflix’s show “The Last Dance” featuring Michael Jordan’s last year in the bull’s NBA team helped to shine light of his victory and success in his time to the public. Personally as a basketball lover, I’ve always followed him and his amazing story since the beginning of the internet era (I’m serious!). However, getting to 2 years into my software engineering journey helped me see different principles from his life that I could apply into my tech journey. In this post, I’ve decided to share with you all 6 lessons for the 6 championships that MJ has gotten in his career.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>1. Competitive: there is this need for him to win!</h2>

<p>Here’s this short video that simply puts this competitive aspect of him across clearly!</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b6vlV0mUxs4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>As we can see from his life and the especially in the most recent show that came out “The Last Dance”, we could see how he is competitive on almost every aspect of life. From the game of basketball to the game of golf and to tossing coin that is the nearest to the wall.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mike will compete with anything, though. If we’re drinking water, Mike will be like, ‘I’ll race you!’”<br>
Source:&nbsp;Jimmy Kimmel Live</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the lesson I’ve learnt from him to apply into my software engineer journey: Apart from short once-off games such as a casual golf match, or one-on-one basketball matches, many times in technology, the way to show success over another company or implementation is long term. It isn’t a short fight, every technology solution requires time and effort to implement. But the key take away isn’t to compete with companies, more often than not, you can find yourself collaborating such there both parties can win. I guess the key takeaway is that sense of self confidence. When you first start off your blogging venture like I did, you look into the industry and you start seeing all the successful blogs with million views and high passive income. And you wonder how can you even compare? The message we can take away from Michael Jordan is that attitude that never backs down. You may be the under-dog today but you do not have to stay this way, and you can deliberately choose to be better than what you are now.</p>
<br>
<h2>2. Passion was his fuel. Pour your love into everything you do.</h2>
<br>
<div><p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bMmvIxxADg2PenWvuEErUUJIsA8=/0x0:3029x2033/1820x1213/filters:focal(1066x671:1550x1155):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66666326/101527P_MICHAEL_JORDAN_BULLS.0.jpg" alt=""><em>Michael Jordan crying as he won his first championship</em><br>
￼</p></div>
<p>Here’s a short video that managed to capture the emotions that was building in that locker room after the victory that night.</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ir0-t5Yfq-Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>There’s just so much emotions, energy, and heart placed into this game. From the story of him being cut from his high school basketball team that hurt him over the summer. He decided to pour his heart and do his absolute best to get back onto the team. It has been 7 years since he entered NBA and to finally be able to reach to the top through the many years. Even as Michael cried holding that trophy, there was just so much passion and emotions put into whatever he did.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>”I’ve been waiting seven years for this and I thank God for blessing us to make it possible,”</p>
<p>”This is the happiest moment of my life,” Jordan said. “We did it. We did it as a team. I’ve been fighting to hold back my emotions all week. But I knew we would win it tonight and I knew my emotions would get the best of me. I’m just happy.”<br>
Jordan said.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Heart is what separates the great from the good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, I do see parallel behaviors among the giants even in the technology scene as well. We can see that from the life of Steve Jobs. Here’s an article that briefly talked about his stroy.</p>
<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/11/why-steve-jobs-cried/">Why Steve Jobs cried</a></p>

<p>The main point isn’t to cry over every thing that happened but to talk about that deep sense of passion and heart in what you do. I guess such a level of passion in any tasks or goal speaks more of the dedication that person has as an individual than about the seriousness of the task.</p>

<p>If you want to excel into any industry, you got to have that passion that pushes you beyond the boundaries to explore what could be beyond this limit. This is all the more true in the technology industry where all these technologies advancing with new updates or releases. In order to keep up, you got to have that sense of curiosity to find out what the industry has done to solve all the different problems you have. Only when you have that sense of curiosity then can you want to go out there to find out what are these technology giants doing. Let me give you an illustration:</p>

<p>Here’s a <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://roadmap.sh/devops">Roadmap for devops engineer</a>. It basically charts out for you the set of learnings or knowledge you should know or master if you ever chooses to walk down this path of being a devOps engineer.</p>

<p><strong>Just look at the amount of technology in one single page</strong>. And each box properly takes an individual years to master, and some even pursue just one box their entire career. If you did not have any interest or deep passion for the tools out there, you will probably just ignore most of that because you could just make do with the tools you already know to ‘hack’ your way to a solution.</p>

<p>The successful techies are not always the oldest, but more often than not, you find in these people a deep sense of curiosity and passion for the technology. The way they describe technology almost always sound like they are describing a friend you have to got to know on a daily basis. And one day, I aspire to be like one of them as well (:</p>
<br>
<h2>3. Focused on what he wants to do. And actually go get it</h2>

<p>One common trait among all great players or individuals that we know of, Warran buffet, Steve jobs, and Michael Jordan: They had laser sharp focus on what they want to do.</p>

<p>The focus to improve is not found on the court. What you see on the court in public’s view was merely the outcome of the grind behind closed doors in the gym. The focus to improve starts in the gym behind closed doors and far from media. He made sure to practice harder than that he played. That intensity of personal practice allowed him to create that familiarity and comfort zone during game time, and all he had to do was the react to what his body was already accustomed to do. He focused on getting his fundamentals right. Focused to perfect the small things that noone seem to notice. People only saw the outcome of that focus to little details.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing the little things until perfection becomes a habit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zSVu76AX3I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>Many times people chase after the shiniest objects in the technology space - AI, Automation, Machine Learning. In the act of chasing, people lose sight of the fundamentals - understanding the business problem or creating product and services that business actually need or even simply just focusing on writing clean, testable, and readable code. While articles about AI and Machine learning may create some wows, it is the seemingly dull and ‘boring’ habits of consistently writing code, learning about good coding practices that sharpens your fundamentals. When it is crunch time, you will find yourself well equipped to shine in your work. These little act of grinding can be attending online courses to learn more about courses that does hands-on projects with you.</p>

<p>One such course is <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pluralsight.com/">Plural sight</a>. They have really detailed courses with instructors that will guide you through the fundamentals of what you are learning, impart the best practices and share their learning in a walkthrough guide that you can do alongside them. Another will be udemy. Check those out.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>When you practice daily and deliberately, you will find yourself ready when the next challenge or problem comes your way.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h2>4. Together we can do more: he has a close group of people to keep him grounded</h2>

<p>People do not usually see this aspect of him when we hear of the great Michael Jordan. Many instances, I’ve noticed from all the videos, he always had the support of his parents and siblings when he hits rock bottom. Even during the first championship, his dad was present there alongside him. And was also there to deal with backlashes about MJ’s gambling habits.</p>

<p>Imagine the devastation to know that your strong support was taken away just like that.</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GG5xXWHyq9g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>If you want to go far, you have to go together as a team. Over the years, I’ve came to understand that if we want to solve problems that are bigger than ourselves - societal issues, you have to have a team alongside you. You have your strength to offer to the table, but rarely do we see how our strengths alone is able to bring a holistic solution. Yes, you may be an amazing god-like engineer that can replicate another google. Even with all the knowledge in the world, you lack the one resource you cannot buy - time. Everyone of us needs one another. In technology, the ability to come together with our different skills and collaborate opens up door of opportunities.</p>
<br>
<h2>5. Know how to respond to failure: failure is the only way to success</h2>

<p>Michael Jordan did not fear the spot light. He did not shy away from the crunch time. When it was time for the bulls team to take the final score, it goes to him without a question. But that illusion of ‘success since birth’ did not start that way. He was not always a winner. There is this famous quote from him:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JA7G7AV-LT8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>It is always easy to make sense of all these failures on hindsight - this is called the hindsight bias, where the decisions and circumstances you faced seems like an invisible ink before the good outcome, but plain as day after the outcome as if a fool would have missed it.</p>

<p>Similarly in technology, as you start off, you will find yourself deep into the unknown; overwhelmed with unfamiliarity regarding the technology you have to deal with in order to deliver the solution. You make mistakes in your earlier days and thus causing scalability issues when the solution starts to scale to hundreds of people. Since that feature is implemented by you, these mistakes and bugs are starting to …</p></span></p></div></div>

			<p>We have had the information stage. You could argue we are now in a curation stage. Or maybe an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2019/01/16/what-will-come-after-the-information-age/#769187363d7d">‘age of reckoning’</a> where technology needs to step up and prove it’s worth. But what if we entered an entirely new stage? One that leads to the act of connecting the knowing with the doing. We could call it an ‘age of usefulness’. In this age we possess knowledge but the change will come from translating it into something useful. I’m not the first to use the label ‘Useful Knowledge’, I discovered there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_the_Diffusion_of_Useful_Knowledge">‘Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge’ that was founded in 1826 with the objective of publishing information to people who were unable to obtain formal education</a>. Our objective is slightly different but it serves a similar purpose. Make information more useful to the average person. To reframe the objective for 2020, how do we turn our world overflowing with information and stamped with likes and shares, into useful knowledge and actions for anyone?</p>
<h4>Curation and the Slow Web</h4>
<p>There are lots of apps and sites trying to curate – <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> news apps like <a href="https://flipboard.com/">FlipBoard, </a>Apple News, or <a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na.</a> Some of these get the users to curate which makes sense. It’s logical to take all the information which is flooding our senses and try to filter the signal from the noise. These curation based apps are a welcome attempt to try and help us find the best content for us. Yet in our quest for to transform information to useful action, it still doesn’t get us much further in our objective. We continue to skim and like and share. It’s just a bit more relevant.</p>
<p>Is it a return of a slower mode of internet? <a href="https://pando.com/2020/07/13/return-slow-web-movement/">I like the ethos of a ‘slow web’ as described here with some examples.</a> It takes us back to a steady pace where we can take the time over consumption of content. An opportunity to halt the endless scrolling and trolling. However, the downside is it looks and feels a bit like regression. While they are wonderfully simple sites, sometimes they look like we just stepped back into the 90’s. It’s a struggle to know how to get started. This may be down to user ignorance because we are so accustomed to the mechanism of the social feed. Or it could be the fact that gossip and clickbait are addictive. For all its controversies, Facebook and Twitter made it easy for people to get going. The challenge with the ‘slow web’ may be the difficulty to get into a rhythm of this new mode of consumption, leading to a natural hesitation to dive in and engage.</p>
<h4>Maybe It’s Time for Something Different?</h4>
<p>It’s overdue that we try to create something more useful. We need to make the most of all the information we have available and take it to a natural next stage of evolution.</p>
<p>We could dream a little. Imagine a newly designed social platform that provides content. On this new platform, instead of a passive like, the user indicates something useful like intention. Intention that will encourage the user to do an action related to the content and let the provider of the content know that the user is interested. From this the user is guided to the next useful step. This may involve signing up, adding to a task list, sending an e-mail or anything that would logically follow as an action from the content.</p>
<p>This proposal isn’t exactly new. We have seen it before with the capture of intent via assistants or intelligence built in but somehow we seem to have missed a step. For instance, an assistant will try to do something for you if you ask for it. Sometimes proactively by trying to predict ahead and make suggestions. Although this approach sometimes it gets it right, other times it gets it so very wrong. The missing step is the connection between consuming the knowledge and then signaling your intention to move ahead with action. All too often, the assistant or system will try to calculate intention too soon when all that is needed is an initial nudge or nod that you want to take the next step. We’re trying to go from knowledge to doing too quickly and usefulness can be lost in translation.</p>
<h4>From Knowing to Doing</h4>
<p>The path from knowing about something to doing is full of obstacles and rarely straightforward.</p>
<p>We are very good at consuming content like information, data, and knowledge. We’re experts at searching and locating the content we need. However, linking action to that knowledge is not so easy for us. To do something on the basis of knowledge is essential if we want to have our new found knowledge make a difference. We can choose to take the advice of the writer, influencer, organization or we can let it capture our attention for a minute, move swiftly on and forget we even saw it. We’re none the wiser.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://recknsense.com/recknwho/">‘Who Else’ section of Recknsense</a>, I’m running an experiment to understand the connection between content and action. I post up content I have read or watched. These could be YouTube videos, films, TV, documentaries, Vistas, books, magazines or articles – anything I’m interested in. I invite others to vote to say yes they’ve seen the content too or if they haven’t, no but they intend to. I want to see if this connects the information to some kind of action. Eventually this could go to the next stage by saving the intentions for the user to act on at a future date or prompting with next steps. As a bonus for me, I get to see who else has the same interests.</p>
<p>Time will tell what results my experiment yields. In the mean time, I can enjoy the fact that I can control and curate my own content, I’m free from fast and fickle feeds, and best of all, I hope sincerely that some of it may turn out useful for you.</p>

<h2>Announcing the General Availability of OKD4</h2>
<p>Today, the OKD-WG is pleased to announce the General Availability of OKD4, the community distribution of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes platform. With today’s GA release of OKD4, Red Hat continues its commitment to open source and open collaboration with the Kubernetes and other Cloud Native communities.</p>

<h2>OKD’s Origins</h2>
<p>In April 2012, Red Hat first released Origin as the open source upstream project of OpenShift. We had little inkling of the phenomenal trajectory of cloud-native technology that was to come. From the rise of containers, the birth of OCI and Fedora CoreOS, and now the <a href="https://www.openshift.com/blog/operator-framework-moves-to-cncf-for-incubation" rel=" noopener">CNCF’s incubation of Operator Framework</a>, it has been an amazing ride. OKD4 wouldn’t be possible without all these incredible innovative technologies and their communities.</p>
<p>During the 3.x release timeframe, OKD has been a stable basis for OpenShift Container Platform, acting as an upstream distribution based on community-driven components - CentOS and Project Atomic to name a few. With the advent of the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image">Universal Base Image,</a> relations between OKD and OCP has changed - from "upstream-downstream" to what we call "sibling distributions." Images are built using RHEL7 base and can be distributed simultaneously for OKD and OCP, with no rebuild necessary. This enables both distributions to get updated code earlier, including security fixes from RHEL7, and provides a stable base for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>OpenShift 4.x heavily focuses on high availability, observability and seamless upgrades. With the OKD 4 release, the community is not only getting easy access to these features, but also the ability to affect the direction of the platform (via <a href="https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/">enhancements process</a>) and a community space for experimentation, discussion and knowledge sharing. The Operators pattern used throughout the design of OKD 4 is allowing users to maintain clusters efficiently over their lifetime.</p>
<h2>Release Highlights</h2>
<p>OKD4 uses <a href="https://youtu.be/JepNm7R0LSo">Fedora CoreOS</a> as a base OS for the nodes. It enables the cluster with recent security fixes, new features (like cgroups v2 support) and updated software. OKD4 is using the same images as the corresponding OpenShift Container Platform release. As a result, the community can participate in the development and can modify any part of the cluster in order to achieve specific goals.</p>
<p>The cluster still has the same features as in OKD3 - it can be installed in the user environment, configured to user liking and updated.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How it differs from OCP</h2>
<p>Unlike OCP there are several distinctive features in OKD4:</p>
<p>As a community distribution it does not require a pull secret from <a href="https://openshift.com/try">https://openshift.com/try</a>. All OKD4 images are available without additional authentication. The base OS image for OKD4 is available at <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/">https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/</a>. However some optional operators from <a href="https://operatorhub.io/" rel=" noopener">operatorhub.io</a> require a pull secret, so by default OKD4 installs a source with community operators only. See <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-enable-the-non-community-red-hat-operators">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
<p>OCP is an opinionated Kubernetes distribution with a heavy focus on high availability and production workloads. This puts restrictions on cluster configuration - for instance, single master installations are not supported. OKD4, however, allows users to install single master clusters - for development or stage environments. These clusters cannot be upgraded to later versions, though.</p>
<p>OKD4 creates a new nightly release after OCP tests are completed by our CI system. Every two weeks we'll promote a nightly to a stable release stream, so users can get updates to latest and tested code without switching channels.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Installing OKD4 is as easy as OCP4 - see <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd#getting-started">Getting Started</a> for instructions.</p>
<p>OKD-specific documentation is available at <a href="https://docs.okd.io/">docs.okd.io</a></p>

  <p><span>30 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Research has begun to reveal many algorithms can be expressed as matrix multiplication, suggesting an unrealized connection between linear algebra and computer science. I speculate graphs are the missing piece of the puzzle. Graphs are not only useful as cognitive aides, but are suitable data structures for a wide variety of tasks, particularly on modern parallel processing hardware.</p>

<p>In this essay, I explore the virtues of graphs, algebra, types, and show how these concepts can help us reason about programs. I propose a computational primitive based on graph signal processing, linking software engineering, graphs, and linear algebra. Finally, I share my predictions for the path ahead, which I consider to be the start of an exciting new chapter in computing history.</p>

<p><em>n.b.: None of these ideas are mine alone. Shoulders of giants. Follow the links and use landscape mode for optimal reading experience.</em></p>



<p>Over the last decade, I bet on some strange ideas. A lot of people I looked up to at the time laughed at me. I’ll bet they aren’t laughing anymore. I ought to thank them one day, because their laughter gave me a lot of motivation. I’ve said some idiotic things to be sure, but I’ve also made some laughable predictions that were correct. Lesson learned: aim straighter.</p>

<p>In 2012, I was in Austin sitting next to an ex-poker player named <a href="https://twitter.com/amirpc">Amir</a> who was singing Hinton’s praises. Hypnotized by his technicolor slides, I quit my job in a hurry and started an educational project using speech recognition and restricted Boltzmann machines. It never panned out, but I learned a lot about ASR and Android audio. Still love <a href="http://breandan.net/2014/02/09/the-end-of-illiteracy/">that idea</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017, I started writing a book on the ethics of automation and <a href="http://breandan.net/2017/02/02/trust-in-automation/">predicted</a> mass unemployment and social unrest. Although I got the causes wrong (pandemic, go figure), the information economy and confirmation bias takes were all dead right. Sadly, this is now driving the world completely insane. Don’t say I warned you, go out and fix our broken systems. The world needs more engineers who care.</p>

<p>In 2017, I witnessed the birth of <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>, which I stole from Chris Olah and turned into a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a>. Had a lot of trouble convincing people that classical programs could be made differentiable, but look at the proceedings of any machine learning conference today and you’ll find dozens of papers on differentiable sorting and rendering and simulation. Don’t thank me, thank Chris and the Theano guys.</p>

<p>In 2018, I correctly predicted Microsoft would acquire GitHub to mine code. Why MS and not Google? I’ll bet they tried, but Google’s leadership had fantasies of AGI and besides JetBrains, MS were the only ones who gave a damn about developers. Now ML4SE is a thriving <a href="https://ml4se.github.io/">research area</a> and showing up in <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/DeepBugsPlugin">real</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-assisted-intellisense-for-your-teams-codebase/">products</a>, much to the chagrin of those who believed ML was a fad. I suspect their hype filter blinded them to the value those tools provide.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction: MS will acquire GH within five years. If the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML4Code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ML4Code</a> stuff delivers for MS, acquisition is highly likely. Although it would have been cheaper a few years ago. <a href="https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD">https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD</a> <a href="https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps">https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps</a></p>— breandan (@breandan) <a href="https://twitter.com/breandan/status/993553301927936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>But to heck with everything I’ve said! If I had just one idea to share with these ML people, it would be types. Beat that drum as loud as I could. Types are the best tool we know for synthetic reasoning. If you want to build provably correct systems that scale on real-world applications, use types. Not everyone is convinced yet, but mark my words, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12345">types</a> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#pep-585-builtin-generic-types">coming</a>. Whoever figures out how to connect types and learning will be the next Barbara Liskov or Frances Allen.</p>

<p>This year, I predicted the pandemic weeks before the lockdown, exited the market, and turned down a job at Google. Some people called me crazy. Now I’m going all-in on some new ideas (none of which are mine). I’m making some big bets and some will be wrong, but I see the very same spark of genius in them.</p>



<p>As a kid, I was given a book on the history of mathematics. I remember it had some interesting puzzles, including one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">some bridges</a> in a town divided by rivers, once inhabited by a man called Euler. Was there a tour crossing each bridge exactly once? Was it possible to tell without checking every path? I remember spending days trying to figure out the answer.</p>

<p>In the late 90s, my mom and I went to Ireland. I remember visiting Trinity College, and learning about a mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">Hamilton</a> who discovered a famous formula connecting algebra and geometry, and carved it onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge">bridge</a>. We later visited the bridge, and the tour guide pointed out the stone, which we touched for good luck. The Irish have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulnabrone_dolmen">thing</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">stones</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was applying to college and took the train from Boston to South Bend, Indiana, home of the Fighting Irish. Wandering about, I picked up a magazine article by a Hungarian mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">Barabási</a> then at Notre Dame, who had some interesting things to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network">complex networks</a>. Later in 2009, while studying in Rochester, I <a href="http://breandan.net/images/complex_network_seminar.png">carpooled</a> with a <a href="https://avesis.medeniyet.edu.tr/hasan.guclu">nice professor</a>, and learned complex networks are found in brains, languages and many marvelous places.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017. I was lured by the siren song of algorithmic differentiation. Olivier Breleux presented <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/myia">Myia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breuleux/buche">Buche</a>. Matt Johnson gave a talk on <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a>. I met Chris Olah in Long Beach, who gave me the idea to study <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>. I stole his idea, dressed it up in Kotlin and traded it for a POPL workshop paper and later a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">Master’s thesis</a>. Our contributions were using algebra, shape inference and presenting AD as term rewriting.</p>

<p>In 2019, I joined a lab with a <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">nice professor</a> at McGill applying knowledge graphs to software engineering. Like logical reasoning, knowledge graphs are an idea from the first wave of AI in the 1960s and 70s which have been revived and studied in light of recent progress in the field. I believe this is an important area of research with a lot of potential. Knowledge and traceability plays a big role in software engineering, and it’s the bread-and-butter of a good IDE. The world needs better IDEs if we’re ever going to untangle this mess we’re in.</p>

<p>This Spring, I took a fascinating seminar on <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html">Graph Representation Learning</a>. A lot of delightful graph theory has been worked out over the last decade. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> turned into power iteration. People have discovered many interesting connections to linear algebra, including Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, graph Laplacians, Krylov methods, and spectral graph theory. These ideas have deepened our understanding of graph signal processing and its applications for learning and program analysis. More on that <a href="#graphs-computationally">later</a>.</p>



<p>Graphs are general-purpose data structures used to represent a variety of data types and procedural phenomena. Unlike most sequential languages, graphs are capable of expressing a much richer family of relations between entities, and are a natural fit for many problems in computer science, physics, biology and mathematics. Consider the following hierarchy of data structures, all of which are graphs with increasing expressive power:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sets</strong>: datasets, multisets, posets, alphabets</li>
  <li><strong>Sequences</strong>: Lists, strings, arrays, linear function composition</li>
  <li><strong>Trees</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract syntax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">XML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogeny</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decision trees</a></li>
  <li><strong>DAGs</strong>: <a href="https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">Git</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_network">citations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph">dependency graphs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_management_system">workflows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph">control flow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">MLPs</a></li>

  <li><strong>Hypergraphs</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf">Knowledge</a>, <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">Zettelkasten</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">categories</a>, <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/">physics</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkpACe1lx">hypernetworks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As we realized in <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad">Kotlin∇</a>, directed graphs can be used to model mathematical expressions, as well as other formal languages, including source code, intermediate representations and binary artifacts. Not only can graphs be used to describe extant human knowledge, many recent examples have shown that machines can “grow” trees and graphs for various applications, such as program synthesis, mathematical deduction and physical simulation. Recent neuro-symbolic applications have shown promising early results in graph synthesis:</p>

  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11212.pdf">Symbolic Pregression: Discovering Physical Laws from Raw Distorted Video</a> (Udrescu &amp; Tegmark, 2020).</li>

  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10593.pdf">Neural Execution of Graph Algorithms</a>, Veličković et al. (2020)</li>
</ul>

<p>The field of natural language processing has also developed a rich set of graph-based representations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar">constituency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">dependency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar">link</a> and other and other typed attribute grammars which can be used to reason about syntactic and semantic relations between natural language entities. Research has begun to show many practical applications for such grammars in the extraction and organization of human knowledge stored in large text corpora. Those graphs can be further processed into ontologies for logical reasoning.</p>

<p>Using coreference resolution and entity alignment techniques, we can reconstruct internally consistent relations between entities, which capture cross-corpus consensus in natural language datasets. When stored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf">knowledge graphs</a>, these relations can be used for information retrieval and question answering, e.g. on wikis and other content management systems. Recent techniques have shown promise in automatic knowledge base construction (cf. <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00088">Reddy et al.</a>, 2016).</p>

<p>Lo and behold, the key idea behind knowledge graphs is our old friend, types. Knowledge graphs are multi-relational graphs whose nodes and edges possess a type. Two entities can be related by multiple types, and each type can relate many pairs of entities. We can index an entity based on its type for knowledge retrieval, and use …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-2248">

	<div>
		<p>Today I was reminded of the first post I ever wrote on this blog (<a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/voice-ai-telecom-scams-and-co-evolution/">Voice AI, Telecom, Scams, and Co-evolution</a>), back in 2018. My first article was focused on second-order effects of emerging voice AI capabilities and projected a number of scams that the technology would enable.</p>
<p>While this tech also has many positives, I always try to get a fuller picture by looking at the system.</p>
<p>The world is full of trade offs. In the case of voice AI in the article, we have the ability to scale up scams that historically worked, but only in small does. The “hey grandma” scam was one example. As I wrote <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/voice-ai-telecom-scams-and-co-evolution/">back then</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“An older scam that this tech will scale is what’s known as the “<a href="https://www.womansday.com/life/a58837/hey-grandma-scam/">Hey, Grandma</a>” scam, where a grandparent gets a call from a “grandchild” in distress. There are different flavors of this. For US grandparents the story is often that the grandchild got into legal trouble and needs money wired. In China and Taiwan, it’s often that the grandchild has been kidnapped and is being beaten up. Again, wire the money.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t matter that most don’t fall for the scam. In cases like these where you can take a process of theft that formerly needed a human thief to target people one by one, by automating the process, you can benefit from scale effects. That is, it doesn’t matter that only a tiny fraction of people fall for the scam as long as you can spread it around broadly enough and not use up all of your time doing it.</p>
<p>Today a different scam played out on Twitter. Multiple well-known accounts (Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mike Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, and more) were hacked. Their pinned tweets became versions of this message. (I blocked part of the address so I wouldn’t be distributing this even further.)</p>
<p><img src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Bill-and-Elon-300x122.png" alt="" width="550" height="223" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Bill-and-Elon-300x122.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Bill-and-Elon-768x312.png 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Bill-and-Elon-1024x416.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>The messages on the hacked accounts were up for a couple hours — quite a while in online terms for such large accounts. Only Twitter really knows how many people saw the tweets, but it’s roughly:</p>
<p><em>the total number of followers of the accounts (perhaps close to 100 million) + the number of people Twitter showed the retweets (people retweeted out of both belief and irony) x the percent of people who happened to be on Twitter for those couple hours x the percent of people who believed the messages x the percent who had Bitcoin…</em></p>
<p>What’s more, these messages apparently resulted in around $60,000 of Bitcoin transferred to the scammer’s account, which was then transferred elsewhere.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this is that even by taking over all of those large follower accounts, the scam only managed to affect around 300 people and $60,000. There are much bigger scams that we never hear about. I can’t help but think that this scam in particular seemed like a bigger deal because the scammers took over what is in effect a public discourse channel that these large accounts use.</p>
<p>Like any large-scale sudden unexpected news, it led to a lot of contemplation. One of the most interesting critiques I saw was this one.</p>
<p><img src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Twitter-idea-300x232.png" alt="" width="550" height="426" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Twitter-idea-300x232.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Twitter-idea-768x594.png 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Twitter-idea.png 941w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>It’s a good question, why indeed is this the best that somebody could do. But we’re probably overthinking this. This seems to be a hit and run, not anything grander. But it has certainly made me (and I’m sure others) think about what exposure we have to Twitter and other user-generated content (UGC) networks.</p>
<p>Others came along to warn people away from the scam. While the scam propagated fast, it was also interesting to see just how fast users on the network helped prevent damage. Someone actually registered a <a href="https://bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh.com/">domain name</a> with the scammer’s address just to show this message.</p>
<p><a href="https://bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh.com/"><img src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-dont-send-Bitcoin-300x83.png" alt="" width="550" height="152" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-dont-send-Bitcoin-300x83.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-dont-send-Bitcoin-768x213.png 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-dont-send-Bitcoin-1024x283.png 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-dont-send-Bitcoin.png 1481w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></a></p>
<p>In an older time, people wondered about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_signal_intrusion"><strong>broadcast signal intrusion</strong></a> — in other words, taking over the airwaves — to broadcast a diabolical message to a helpless population who only have access to three TV channels. Those villains, both real and fictional, did this to intimidate or brag, not to steal.</p>
<p>But back to the Twitter accounts hack. Rather than steal $60K, imagine if the scammers set their sights higher. Wouldn’t it be much better to try to persuade a large audience? <strong>Imagine doing this on election day.</strong></p>

What are you reading today? What have you learnt today that you did not know previously.</p>

<p>In today’s article, its a curation of the articles i’ve read on the second half of June! The articles are classified to the few topics:</p>
<br>
<h2>Topics covered</h2>
<ul>
<li>General Technology and resources for video call</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>General</li>
<li>Design patterns</li>
<li>Management for tech</li>

<p>Software reuseability does not always allow you to copy code wholesale to be placed into another. It requires you to make tweaks and alterations to get it to work as intended in another application. It’s more of an organ transplant than a lego brick. An accurate illustration to share a point! (:</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fly.io/blog/how-cdns-generate-certificates/">How CDNs generate certificate</a></p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://fly.io/">fly.io</a>’s article is really interesting. It goes into the mechanics of how certifications are issued, and how does Let’s Encrypt verify your domain belongs to you. That is through the ACME protocol of course. Interstingly, they do provide free tier k8s services at $10/mth equivalent of paid services. Thats super decent. They seek to be competitive with the bigger players such as Google Cloud , Amazon Web Service and Azure.</p>

<p>If you heard about ansible, it seeks to serve the same role - configuration management. Maybe a good alternative to ansible if it has different dependences that VMs may not have for ansible.</p>

<p>Saw this and its interesting to see hacker news stream in a different format. It would be nice to have a refresh button instead of a manual refresh to get updates.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://regexone.com/">learning regex</a></p>

<p>This website allows you to learn regex with good explanations with exercises that allows you to get your hands dirty. Being an advocate of learn by doing.  I really like how learning has been made easier for people to pick up a skill in bite sizes. No we should not spoon feed people but neither do we give a medium rare steak to a baby. Everything requires a progress and a series of steps to learn the essential skills before proceeding to a higher level competency. Personally, this is a good example of what seems like a lightweight and highly reusable static site for learning a new skill. Definitely a reference for my next pet projects.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/schenkd/nginx-ui">Nginx UI</a></p>

<p>As i was talking about Nginx as a file server, Nginx configuration has always been done via the command line and CLI. This is really amazing to have a UI for you to do your configuration with nice buttons to enable or disable your nginx settings. Really neat and interesting for you to consider on your own project.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://mediasoup.org/documentation/overview/">Mediasoup a Selective Forwarding Unit tool for RTC applications</a></p>

<p>If you want to create a webRTC application, there are many architecture to consider. You can read up more about them in my previous post <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/">here</a>. In order to scale one, you have to consider the Selective Forwarding Unit as the server to transmit your media from your device to your remote peers. One of the beliefs I have is “never reinvent the wheel”. We are in a technology era where many giants have gone before you and already created many tools available for use. So in the case of scalability, it is true that there is no one tool that helps you to address all the technical challenges, but knowing the components of a successful and scalable video call application allows you to then identify the right tools for its respective components.</p>

<p>Here’s a video talking about mediasoup as well:</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how people across the world are also attempting to solve the same problem, and this time he was able to break down the entire technology stack he used for his video call application. I wonder if it is able to deal with its scalability issue? As well. Below are a TON of articles about video call application that people has so kindly shared with me and now it is my responsibility to delve deeper into this topic and make sense of it.</p>

<p>Chanced upon this simple gadget - a full size 50 keys keyboard with a grey screen that is only about to contain 6 lines of words at any one point. This gadget was created as a way to focus on one thing - typing. For those that are in need for productivity, perhaps such a gadget can help you on that. Beyond productivity, i always wonder if students that are just starting out on their english education could start with such a gadget as well. Simple and straight to the point. It is a keyboard and all you can do is to type and make sense of what is written. But of course, english language goes beyond just stringing words together, that is only the outcome of many other fundamental skills such as grammar and understanding verbs, nouns, pronouns etc.</p>

<p>Data is asset. As with all things, once we start to put our own agenda over the rights (privacy rights in this case) of people, thats where the problem starts. Although there are clause to indicate that they may still collect data from you in incognito mode, i guess this violation of rights still stands. In the realm of technology, its all chill and breezy until you start collecting data from users. That’s when you are in for a whole new ball game. Does your entire architecture considered the suite of security measures before your collect your customers first data?

Starting up a company is definitely a trying time and we have to gather as much meaningful knowledge and skills else we will risk bringing the company down. Community support is also crucial for us to exchange experiences and more importantly lessons from one another’s mistakes. This will definitely be something one should put some serious thought if you wish to start your own</p>

All powerful tools can be disastrous if it lands onto the hands of scheming ones.

<p>When we want to grow, more often than not, we choose skirt the challenge before us and find easier alternatives because we feel inadequate. Here’s an example, if you want to learn a language, lets say korean, and somehow you managed to have a job offer that allows you to speak korean, but you choose to turn down that job because you dont feel confident enough in your language yet. So instead, you choose to listen to podcast at home everyday until you feel you are ready. You know what could have helped you to get better in korean? Working at a job in korean.</p>

<p>This is a common tendency as we make crippling decisions if these decisions are directed by fear. Fear has its own way to manipulate us to find alternatives with its fair share of difficulty to substitute the real thing itself. If you want to growth and succeed? There is no other way, but one way: fail forward.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>From&nbsp;<em>Futures</em> 27 (7)&nbsp; 777-794 September 1995.</p>

<p>Cyberspace is being described as the ‘new frontier’. But the notion of the new frontier is a mythic formulation, constructed to bring the past into an organized and reinterpreted unity with the present and emphasize how the new ‘territory’ is to be dominated and controlled in the future. The occupation of cyberspace has direct parallels with the colonisation of non-Western cultures. Cyberspace is turning out to be the new Other of Western civilization which is projecting all its colonial prejudices, and the images of sex and violence in which it framed non- Western cultures, on to cyberspace. But this time the darker side of the West is bouncing back on itself.</p>

<p>Richard Pepin’s <em>Hologram Man</em> is a thirdgrade film with a first-class insight into Western psychosis. It exhibits and plays with all that Western man desires, all that lies buried deep in his consciousness, and all that is steaming his restless soul. The story is quite one dimensional. A rookie cop, Decoda, arrests a psychotic terrorist, Slash Gallagher, after a bloody encounter. In his own evil way, Slash just wants the world be a better place and free of the Corporation that rules it; and in his own legal way, Decoda too just wants the world to be a better place and doesn’t really care for the Corporation that sustains him! Slash is sentenced to the worst form of imprisonment that the future can offer: holographic stasis. His body is turned into a hologram, while his brain and soul are stored in a computer to be reprogrammed. Slash’s multicultural gang (this is a pc film!) manage to free their leader, hacking his mind and soul out of the computer, but his body is destroyed in the attempt. Slash pours an artificial skin on himself and walks the earth as an electromagnetic hologram: walking through walls, changing his physical identity at will, a mind, a soul, free from the limitations of physical existence he is invincible, a man turned into god by virtual reality. As is usual with such narratives, Decoda too turns into a hologram to defeat and capture his foe. Even though he is not as strong as Slash, Decoda is smarter. In the final encounter, Decoda not only kills<br>
Slash but also takes care of the equally evil chairman of the Corporation.</p>

<p>The tone of <em>Hologram Man</em> is set within the first ten minutes of the film: grand spectacle wrapped in grotesque violence and graphic sex. Its origins in computer games like <em>Doom 2</em> and <em>Mortal Kombat</em> are quite evident; as is its love affair with digital technology, which played no small part in its production, and virtual reality. Such combinations of violence, advance technology and sex are not only used to sell films and video games (they are the raison d’etre of <em>Hologram Man</em> and numerous other similar films like <em>Digital Man, Brain Scan, Videodrome</em> and <em>Lawnmower Man</em>), they also come in rather useful in shaping civilizations. Violence, advance technology and sex have been the containers-vats-within which the West has existed for much of the second half of the millennium. In the normal course of events, the West has used these barrels to capture non-Western civilizations and cultures and then projected its own darker side on to them, portraying and describing and therefore containing-them in terms of violence, sex and primitive technology.</p>

<p>At the end of the second millennium, however, the standard grand narrative appears to be going through a new, and interesting twist: the darker side of the West is bouncing back on itself! The very materials with which the West painted all Other civilizations is now acquiring a life of its own and is threatening to recast the projected image as well as the selfperception of the West. As the body of Western civilization gradually dissolves into digitial technology, it is slowly being replaced, just like those of Slash and Decoda in <em>Hologram Man</em>, with a transparent virtual skin that reveals the true darkness that lies underneath-in the mind and soul of the West. Decoda and Slash are the two Janus-like faces of Western civilization: one, the projected innocence standard-bearer of civilization, the enforcer of universal law and morals; the other, pathologically untamed, the psychotic inner reality. To look at the inner reality of the West, the darker side it projects on to Other cultural and mental landscapes, we must look at the West’s latest conquest, the new domain that it has colonized: cyberspace.</p>

<h2>The allure of the colon</h2>

<p>Western civilization has always been obsessed with new territories to conquer. The narratives of these conquests, on the whole, have followed a basic, linear pattern. The hunger for new conquests stems from the insatiable desire to acquire new wealth and riches which in turn provides impetus for the development of new technologies of subjugation which are then employed to bring new territories under the servitude of the West. Once a new territory has been colonized, it is handed over to business interests to loot; and the worst elements of the West are posted there to administer and civilize the natives. The natives themselves are rendered nonpeople by framing them with the images of all that the West fears about itself. Cristobal Colon’s (aka Columbus) voyage to the ‘new world’, for example, was a product of the quest for wealth and riches, what in contemporary parlance we would call ‘new markets’. Colon and those who followed him, adventurers and perverts, rampaged what they discovered and butchered the natives they encountered. The West’s conquest and colonisation of the Muslim world was motivated by its image of the Orient where unfathomable riches existed and cruel and barbaric scenes were staged. Once colonized, Islam was projected as evil and depraved, licentious and barbaric, ignorant and stupid, monstrous and ugly, fanatic and violent-the very traits of those who went to the Muslim world to rule it, civilize it, and strip it of its wealth and power. The English and Dutch East India Companies went to India and Indonesia looking for new markets and, with the aid of advanced military technology, enslaved their cultures and turned these countries into gold mines for the homeland. The conquest of the American West was spurred by the gold rush, the desire of the settlers for absolute freedom, and ended with the almost total annihilation of the native Indians. When the West ran out of physical landscapes to conquer it moved into mental territories. Colonization paved the way for modernity. During the second half of this century, modernity relentlessly conquered almost every culture and every mind. Under colonization, the basic weapon was the brute force of military technology; modernity combines military technology with communication technology, Western cultural products and instrumental rationality. The ‘civilizing mission’ gives way to ‘progress’ and ‘modernization’ and produces the same effect: cultures are decimated, bulldozed, ‘globalized’ with barbaric abandon. When mental and cultural territories are exhausted, the West moves on to conquer the reality of Other people. The end of modernity, ushers in the all-embracing totality of postmodernism. In Other peoples’ reality, Other ways of knowing and being, Other identities, postmodernism has discovered new spaces to conquer and subdue. Here ‘progress’, ‘modernization’ and instrumental rationality are replaced with relativism, real human beings are filtered through electronic screens to render them into virtual imagesall the better to exploit them and butcher them without feeling real emotions.’ Virtual persons bleed virtual blood-just like so many computer games, including that simulation of the real things, <em>War in the Gulf</em>.2</p>

<p>Beyond postmodernism’s subjugation of the realities, modes of knowing and actual being of Other cultures, the West urgently needs new spaces to conquer. The moon and the inner planets are ruled out for the time being given the cost of colonizing them. The outer space is a domain best left, for the time being, to <em>Star Trek, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager,</em> and <em>Space Precinct</em>. For the conquest to be continued unabated, new terrestrial territories have to be found; and where they don’t actually exist, they must be created. Enter, cyberspace.</p>

<p>Like most new technologies, cyberspace did not appear, to use the words of Chris Chesher, ‘from nowhere as a mystical spark of inspiration from the mind of one individual’.3 It is a conscious reflection of the deepest desires, aspirations, experiential yearning and spiritual angst of Western man, it is resolutely being designed as a new market, and it is an emphatic product of the culture, worldview and technology of Western civilization. That it is a ‘new frontier’, a ‘new continent’, being reclaimed from some unknown wilderness by heroic figures not unlike Cristobal Colon, is quite evident from how the conquest of cyberspace is described by many of its champions. Analogies to colonization abound. The September 1990 edition of the cyberpunk magazine, <em>Mondo 2000</em>, carries the cover line: ‘The Rush Is On! Colonizing Cyberspace’.4 Ivan Pope, editor of the British cyberspace magazine <em>3W</em>, describes it as ‘one of those mythical places, like the American West or the African Interior, that excites the passions of explorers and carpetbaggers in equal measures’.’ Howard Rheingold, a guru of the movement, describes his own flirtations with cyberspace as ‘my own odyssey to the outposts of a new scientific frontier. and an advanced glimpse of a possible new world in which reality itself might become a manufactured and metered commodity’.6 Many computer games, like <em>Super Mario Brothers, Civilization, Death Gate, Merchant Colony</em> and <em>Big Red Adventure</em> are little more than updated versions of the great European voyages of discovery. These are not just games but worlds, constructed Western utopias, where all history can be revised and rewritten, all non-Western people forgotten, in …</p></div></div></div></div>

<div>
<p>Reporting by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-venmo-to-roll-out-crypto-buying-and-selling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk </a>on June 22 speculates that Paypal intends to facilitate the direct buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for its 325 million customer base, through both its Paypal and Venmo services. Paypal is no stranger to crypto, it has been partnered with Coinbase to facilitate fiat withdrawals for US, Candian and European users since 2016. But this move marks a shift of its crypto involvement into the mainstream realm with competing services like Robinhood and Square Cash App already having incorporated Bitcoin purchases on their own platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To contextualise the significance of this, we can look at the closest reference point for crypto generated revenue on a mainstream payment platform – Square.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Payments company Square (NYSE:SQ) revealed on May 6, 2020 that it generated $306 million in Bitcoin (BTC) revenue during Q1 2020…Square confirmed that volumes increased by 72% quarter-over-quarter and 367% year-over-year”&nbsp; – (Source: </em><a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/05/161145-payments-company-square-generated-306-million-in-bitcoin-btc-revenue-during-q1-2020/#:~:text=Payments%20company%20Square%20(NYSE%3ASQ,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202020.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Crowdfund Insider</em></a><em>)</em></p>



<p>Square has around 24 million monthly active users, less than 10% of Paypal’s 325 million user base and 40 million active monthly users on Venmo. Paypal’s Q1 2020 reporting of $4.1 billion in net revenue is a leading indicator of what it’s crypto integration signals to the market on cryptocurrencies’ growing mindshare.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Onboarding crypto for growth: Paypal is building a dam wall&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A move to incorporate cryptocurrency on the platform can be seen as a natural extension of PayPal’s user acquisition and growth strategy on two fronts:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Existing cryptocurrency market </strong>– Onboarding fiat funds for the purchase of cryptocurrency continues to be a pain point despite the proliferation of crypto trading platforms. Existing participants and enthusiasts of cryptocurrency could find PayPal to be the easier alternative for onboarding into cryptocurrency trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>New market share for cryptocurrency: </strong>As cryptocurrency grows in consumer mindshare, PayPal could act as the comfortable and trusted first stop for those unfamiliar with the territory.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A globally familiar and trusted payment gateway that is crypto-friendly is perhaps best positioned to channel, contain and manage the oncoming influx of crypto related transaction activity. While others might have been slightly earlier to direct transactions, PayPal will look to leverage its brand dominance to segway as much of this activity into its own dam as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Growing Bitcoin mindshare: Paypal as a trust agent for the masses&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Bitcoin represents a digital currency that is transactable and accepted globally and can be transacted without the need for a trusted third party. Its nature as a trustless currency without borders underpins its narrative as the harbinger of the monetary revolution – a concept inherently tied to its mindshare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s value is a strange phenomenon in and of itself, where users came to a consensus in the absence of the state or platform backed trust elements that traditionally imbue assets or currencies with value. In the place of ‘trust’ the value of Bitcoin initially springboarded off ‘belief’, belief in the ‘work’ that was being done to produce the coins – i.e. the digital mining of the currency. Here the consumption of electricity required for mining represented a cost, and the value of that effort translated into Bitcoin’s value. In its initial stages this cost could be seen as negligible and its value was reflected as such within a small community of enthusiasts who saw a revolution in the monetary system. As this belief propagated, starting from a center of technological enthusiasts and moving outward, mining operations became larger with coordinated efforts and different organisations competing in the space.</p>



<p>The mining input itself didn’t equate to a proportional dollar denominated value, instead the mining represented a ‘unit of belief’ in the system. As the value assigned to this belief grew stronger, eventually drawing in speculators – the unit of belief grew more valuable. As&nbsp; mindshare for Bitcoin grew so too did its value, and in line with the whims of belief the price will continue to fluctuate gaining more stability only as the belief becomes more anchored.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Belief driven adoption: The ripples of a grassroots technology&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We can think about belief adoption as a series of concentric circles:</p>



<ul><li>Core circle : technology enthusiasts – belief in the potential of Bitcoin</li><li>2nd circle: technically inclined –&nbsp; belief in the technical narrative and agreeing that there is value in such technology</li><li>3rd circle – speculators – belief that Bitcoin holds value as a result of the previous two circles</li><li>4th circle – lay audience – whose trust is transferred from existing trust agents / institutions etc.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Knowing that the core to the 3rd circle has already been flushed with belief and crypto is primed to be adopted by a more lay audience, PayPal is well positioned to feed into the 4th layer. The trust built up over two decades across consumers and merchants can’t be overstated, especially in its ability to catalyse lay belief and participation for crypto on behalf of its 325 million users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We increasingly see the 4th layer’s belief adoption being accelerated by both direct and more peripheral signaling. While PayPal,Robinhood, Square etc. are definitely more on the nose, the likes of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Libra (Facebook’s stable currency) and bank/ state backed digital currencies are indirect feedback loops to the belief in the adoption of Bitcoin. Where it may not lead to the direct use of Bitcoin, it does bring people up the curve of trusting, understanding and utilising digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of whether one believes that Bitcoin is a currency or not, the belief adoption cycles have given intrinsic value to Bitcoin as an asset – value that can’t be overlooked. Each layer of belief adoption was accompanied by its own miniature boom and bust cycles bringing us to today. Bitcoin still stands out as a phenomenon, where its value is entirely tied up in its belief adoption structure. Competing digital currencies from trust entities (Facebook as an example) or states still function on the idea of borders (digital or otherwise) and are intrinsically collateralised by the trust and assets of the backing entity – not quite the revolution Bitcoin represents.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Social scalability – trust minimisation in a hyper connected world</h3>



<p>Social scalability: Bitcoin’s inefficiency in computation and scalability is not a flaw but a feature.</p>



<p>“The secret to Bitcoin’s success is certainly not its computational efficiency or its scalability in the consumption of resources.&nbsp; Specialized Bitcoin hardware is designed by highly paid experts to perform only one particular function – to repetitively solve a very specific and intentionally very expensive kind of computational puzzle. That puzzle is called a proof-of-work, because the sole output of the computation is just a proof that the computer did a costly computation.”</p>



<p>“…Bitcoin’s success is that its prolific resource consumption and poor computational scalability is buying something even more valuable: social scalability. Social scalability is the ability of an institution –- a relationship or shared endeavor, in which multiple people repeatedly participate, and featuring customs, rules, or other features which constrain or motivate participants’ behaviors — to overcome shortcomings in human minds and in the motivating or constraining aspects of said institution that limit who or how many can successfully participate. Social scalability is about the ways and extents to which participants can think about and respond to institutions and fellow participants as the variety and numbers of participants in those institutions or relationships grow.&nbsp; It’s about human limitations, not about technological limitations or physical resource constraints…”</p>



<p>Social scalability is measured by the ability of participants to coordinate efficiently for the continued extraction of value even as the network scales. As networks grow, there is a requirement for increasing the level of trust. But with this increase, comes the added cognitive burden for individuals on the potential harms in the network, thus decreasing efficiency. This is especially true of our hyper connected world, where we are required to place trust in many intermediaries to gain benefit from the network. Trust minimisation then becomes an important factor in achieving greater levels of social scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One way to estimate the social scalability of an institutional technology is by the number of people who can beneficially participate in the institution. Another way to estimate social scalability is by the extra benefits and harms an institution bestows or imposes on participants, before, for cognitive or behavioral reasons, the expected costs and other harms of participating in an institution grow faster than its benefits.”</p>



<p>“Satoshi’s breakthrough with money was to provide social scalability via trust minimization: reducing vulnerability to counterparties and third parties alike. By substituting computationally expensive but automated security for computationally cheap but institutionally expensive traditional security, Satoshi gained a nice increase in social scalability. A set of partially trusted intermediaries replaces a single and fully trusted intermediary.”</p>



<p>In order to address the stunting of social scalability in an increasingly hyper connected world, starting from base principles, even with the trade off of efficiency, is an effective method. Traction may be much slower, but from its humble beginnings it could provide humanity with a model for social scalability that would otherwise have been unavailable. The belief that this form of social scalability holds value is demonstrated by the game theory mechanics of the energy expended to secure the network, compared to the value attributed to a Bitcoin by …</p></div></div></div>

You can calculate things on years of data, but doing the calculation might take a day. Real-time is much faster, but you can sort of only work forward in time. Really, you need both these things. If I want to look at my most liked tweet, I need to look at all the old batch data, but also any real-time tweets that I’m doing&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So it’s 2013 Sam Ritchie is a mechanical engineer by training is uncle is Dennis Richie, and he’s working at Twitter, and his job is just translating from one system to the other from real-time to a batch job.</span></p><p><b>Sam:</b><span> And there’s just so many jobs that looked like that, and it kind of looked like that was going to be my life, like just coding these things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You just said enough is enough. Like we need to figure out how to write one piece of code that will run in a real-time world and also in batch world.</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>I guess I’ve come up with the problem from that side where it’s like, “oh, I can calculate this thing, but I just started calculating it and like, the world existed before.”</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b>Y<span>eah, the backfill problem’s hard and it’s hard. Like it just consumes your life writing, you know, backfill jobs and you kinda, you, you stick to really simple things because you know, you’re gonna have to write them twice. You’re going to have to maintain them twice.&nbsp;</span><span>I mean, it’s really not a nice way to live.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Backstory</b></h2><p><b>Adam:</b><span> Hello and welcome to co recursive. I’m Adam Gordon bell. How did Sam get away from these one-off jobs? How did they solve this fast versus big data issue? An issue many are still struggling with, the answer isn’t some new data processing system that he’s here to show.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Well, the answer is actually abstract Algebra and probabilistic data structures.&nbsp; If you don’t know what those are, don’t worry. We’re going to walk through it. We’re also going to talk about what Sam calls portal abstractions. That’s finding abstractions that let you leverage work from other fields, But we’ll do that at the ending. </span><span>Let’s start at the beginning. When Sam was working away at Twitter.</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>I was on the revenue team.&nbsp; I had a colleague named Oscar Boykin who I didn’t know that well. We both maintained one of these like libraries I mentioned before that lived on top of a dupe. He had the scala version. I had this closure version and I’m kind of yet again, I had a task for work that was like building one of these dashboards.</span></p><p><span>You’re trying to count something like, you know, tweets per user per day. You’re just basically grouping on some key and then adding numbers to a database. And there are just so many jobs that looked like that, and it kind of looked like that was going to be my life, like just coding these things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Through, you know, this or that, Oscar and I teamed up to work on some shared piece of machinery for serialization between the code we both maintained and we realized that like we both were doing this sort of thing and he’s got a lower tolerance for BS. You just said enough is enough.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Like we need to figure out how to write one piece of code that will run in the real-time world and also in the batch world.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like this is, this happens with compilers, like this is a compiler problem. Let’s just back off and solve it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>So they solve it. They built version one of this open-source analytics system could do a batch, it could do real-time. Some of the results together. They called it a Summingbird. It sums things, and it’s from Twitter, so it’s a bird. But then they had some interesting revelations about what they had created.</span></p><h2><b>Stitching Things Together</b></h2><p><b>Sam:</b><span> You know, if you really simplify what we’re dealing with here,&nbsp; you’re writing code that is generating for some key, tweets per user, per hour, something that happens. It might just tweet per user, it might be how many users we have.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And then you have some value, you have some counter that you’re ticking, so you’re just incrementing this thing up. And so many machines learning features and dashboards and everything is just like ticking counters. It’s kind of like and that’s like the secret of analytics work is you’re just adding ones. That seems suspicious too. Like that’s something you could maybe break out of like a really, is that all we can do? Like how would you do more complicated things? But so this, this software package, Summingbird was a library that lets you write a logical declaration of what you wanted to happen. And then, the second component of it would take, that data structure that you’ve built and go run it on any number of these different, underlying platforms.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>The God of Counting</b></h2><p><span><strong>Sam:&nbsp;</strong> So I can power a dashboard. I can do backfills. I have this boundary that’s maintained transparently to me, that behind the scenes we’ll give a hard line between the, you know, massive, multi-year database. And then the last couple of hours that are stored in some much harder to manage, much more fragile, but very, very fast, you know, online processing system.</span></p><p><span>And you know, phase one was just write something that can do, you know logically you’re doing the same thing. You’ve been rewriting the same code. Just have the machine write it for you. but it does open this door and this is the topic I wanted to get to.</span></p><p><span>It opens the door and you start to look at this thing and think you know, you have these two buckets. One is like all, all-time before a couple of hours ago, and then you have a bucket for each of the recent hours. So you’re doing this addition of some of the numbers, Uh, but you’re sort of putting parentheses in one case around like years and years of data, and then another set of parentheses around like each of the previous few hours, and then you take this final step of adding them together.</span></p><p><b>Adam:</b><span> If you’re calculating how many times I’ve tweeted, like Hadoop gets like everything up to yesterday, and then I’m adding that to something that’s actually getting the real-time data and just</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>That’s right.</span></p><h2><b>Abstract Algebra</b></h2><p><b>Sam: </b><span>&nbsp;Those are nice ideas, but they’re not that they’re sort of obvious and not that powerful. But this idea of adding things and putting parentheses wherever you want, It also seems kind of innocuous. It’s like this little lamp you pick up, right? It looks kind of, you know, you rub the lamp, you and what you find is like, this idea is not, it’s not your new idea.</span></p><p><span>It’s very simple, but it actually exists in this field of abstract algebra.</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>Alright. Abstract algebra, if you’re not familiar with it, it’s a subfield of math. Stick with me here. I’ll explain it a little bit. A lot of concepts from abstract algebra can be implemented in a programming language. A semigroup is one of these. It’s an interface. It has one method. That method is add or sum. If we want to stick with the summingbird pun. It also has a rule that things have to be associative. You might remember associativity from a high school math class.</span></p><p><span>What happened here is Sam had the system where to calculate analytics. The calculation had to implement a certain interface and then the system could run it in both worlds. The interface had an add method, which meant it was a semigroup, which meant this subfield of math with people talking about seemingly obscure constructs could suddenly enable him to answer interesting questions in his real-time analytics dashboard thing at Twitter.</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>So yeah, you can start slimming things back, and when you slimmed it back almost to nothing, you’re left with this object called a semigroup, which is an idea of: okay I need some set of things. So numbers in what we’ve been doing, which is just counting, some way to quote, add two of them together and get something out that’s like still the same type and then a test that goes along with that. So the test is that I have to be able to do that associatively.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So this is kind of, it sort of sounds like a pedantic Mathy thing. Like there’s this impulse that I’m sure we can get into in the functional programming world to like, like see ideas that seemed mathy and like slap math names on them and just tweet about it and to like spraying that and that, that sucks.</span></p><p><span>But I think it’s, the, the thing you get when you do that when you identify …</span></p></div></div>
