August 29, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/lebanon-schools-whatsapp-group/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/lebanon-schools-whatsapp-group/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>When 27-year-old Lebanese teacher Sara Mazbouh heard news of the Covid-19 stay-at-home order, her mind went straight to her students. Mazbouh, who has been teaching for nine years at a school in the suburbs of Beirut, wondered how they would cope. After the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-protests/protesters-block-roads-in-beirut-other-parts-of-lebanon-idUSKBN1XE0H7">nationwide protests</a> and shutdowns across Lebanon in October of last year, the day-to-day lives of her students would again be paralyzed by circumstances out of their control.</p>



<p>In the early weeks of the shutdown, Mazbouh and her colleagues photocopied their lessons, leaving them for parents to pick up at school. Then, <a href="https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse">like countless others around the world</a>, Mazbouh’s campus announced it would be closing for the rest of the year. Most of her students are firmly middle-class; she knew many parents wouldn’t be able to afford online learning — steady internet and a computer at home <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/lebanon-telecommunication-in-government-hands/a-48634796#:~:text=But%20this%20progress%20does%20not,that%20is%20on%20the%20rise.">aren’t a given</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exasperated, Mazbouh messaged her fellow teachers on WhatsApp. A distance-learning solution, they soon realized, was right in front of them.</p>



<p>In Lebanon, where schools have been closed for over five months, WhatsApp has become an informal distance-learning app for students and teachers. The app allows educators to share their lessons using voice notes, videos, and photos in group chats that mimic a classroom structure.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/451213519?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="220" height="400" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Six-year-old Omar Jamal sings a springtime nursery rhyme for Lebanese Mother’s Day in his backyard.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lebanon’s ongoing financial crisis has made it harder and harder for families to afford their phone bills. In the wake of the massive explosion that rocked the country’s capital in early August, more than 300,000 Beirutis, up to <a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/unicef-says-beirut-children-will-need-special-care-after-blast">one-third of them school-age children</a>, have been displaced from their homes. In spite of the odds, teachers and parents are embracing creative ways to keep their “WhatsApp schools” in session.</p>



<p>For Mazbouh and her fellow teachers, shifting classes to WhatsApp was a matter of necessity. “The school administration didn’t even ask us to pursue WhatsApp teaching as a solution,” she says. “But the kids shouldn’t have to waste their year.” The teachers at Mazbouh’s school had such success with their ad hoc WhatsApp classroom that the administrators organized similar group chats for their elementary school counterparts.</p>



<p>As teachers across the country bring their classrooms to WhatsApp, they have realized there are new students in their classrooms: parents. For younger students, the adults play videos, record their kids completing assignments, and send the footage to teachers, who monitor their progress. Kindergarten teacher Noura Chehayeb shares snippets of her students’ reading progress on Facebook along with encouraging messages for their parents, whom she tags in different posts. The clips offer glimpses into each household’s unique effort to maintain normalcy during the pandemic. In one, a mom films her child singing a nursery song in their backyard. In another, a girl practices her French spelling, while her father talks at a TV playing the nightly news in the background.</p>



<p>Even though it was never intended to be an educational tool, there are unique benefits to WhatsApp distance learning. Some of the higher-end platforms used for distance learning require technical skills and hardware, such as laptops, that not all families possess. WhatsApp requires only a smartphone.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/451211974?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="234" height="426" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Five-year-old Nourhane learns ocean vocabulary. She says she has fun getting filmed and likes to share her homework with her friends.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The app’s “read receipts” function as an unofficial monitoring tool for teachers tracking their students’ participation. Once a student opens a group chat, all texts and photos appear as “seen” from the teacher’s perspective. Antoine Gebian, a 41-year-old private-school teacher, realized WhatsApp treated audio messages a little differently: his students must open each clip to indicate a “played” receipt; he could check if they hadn’t listened to his voice notes. Gebian used the function as a sort of attendance tally for his WhatsApp classroom. While Lebanon’s school curricula are offered in French and English, many parents speak only Arabic fluently. WhatsApp’s voice notes allow Lebanese teachers to switch between the three with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But distance learning, even when held exclusively on WhatsApp, may be out of reach for Lebanon’s students this fall.</p>



<p>The effects of this month’s blast are far-reaching: the nearly 2,700-ton explosion obliterated Beirut’s port, Lebanon’s biggest and its main source for imports that sustain the country. The economic impact will go beyond the city itself. “Many parents are saying they can’t enroll their kids for economic and Covid reasons,” says Mazbouh, who was laid off from her job of nearly a decade in July. “The percentage of parents who are actually enrolling their kids is very low, and if they are, they’re not paying their fees.” Mazbouh’s school closed the same week she lost her job, its principal dismissed along with all the other teachers. Mazbouh says she doesn’t blame the school for the closure. “Our economic situation is very hard,” she says. “They have every right to shut down.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“It’s much easier for children to grasp things if they live in a physical space that portrays it.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>That was before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion-damage.html">the August 4 blast</a>. Initial reports indicate that more than <a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/unicef-says-beirut-children-will-need-special-care-after-blast">120 schools were damaged by the explosion</a>, leaving some 55,000 students without physical classrooms. Lebanese authorities say they plan to host displaced families in those that haven’t been damaged. Together with the pandemic, it makes a return to the classroom this fall unlikely<strong> </strong>for many students in Lebanon. For those schools that do try to stay in session, WhatsApp may be a solution to the myriad challenges they face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carla Najem, a psychologist at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, says prolonged time out of the classroom may have serious repercussions for Lebanese students. “Our basic needs are not being met right now,” says Najem. “[Students] are going through a lot mentally and emotionally.”</p>



<p>Even as conditions in an ailing Lebanon deteriorate, Najem says that certain aspects of distance learning, like sharing photos and videos, can ameliorate some of the long-term negative effects. “It’s much easier for children to grasp things if they live in a physical space that portrays it,” Najem says. “Maybe we need to use those things as an opportunity to help children connect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Najem says we have a lot to learn from students, even as they face a daunting new school year. “Children are very resilient,” she explains. “They adapt much quicker than adults.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>I wanted to install the latest version of zsh on my MacBook Pro. This is
usually the first thing I install when setting up a new machine. A <code>brew
install zsh</code> and a <code>chsh</code> later and I'm good to go (well, technically I had to
add the homebrew location of zsh to <code>/etc/shells</code> as well). Close out
Terminal.app and reopen to make sure my changes took effect, and sure enough,
there's my zsh prompt. </p>
<p>Yes, I know macOS Catalina ships with zsh as the default shell, but I want to
make sure I have the latest... just because.</p>
<p>Curiosity strikes in and I wonder, even though the homebrew location of zsh is
configured as my shell, am I actually using it?</p>
<h2>which</h2>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % which zsh</span>
<span>/usr/local/bin/zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Hold on. I want the full location.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % ls -la $(which zsh)</span>
<span>lrwxr-xr-x  1 wally  admin  27 Dec 28 20:28 /usr/local/bin/zsh -&gt; ../Cellar/zsh/5.7.1/bin/zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Yup, that looks about right. </p>
<p>But wait... that only told me the location of zsh the executable which is only
correct because I added homebrew's <code>/usr/local/bin</code> location to my <code>PATH</code>. That is literally
the first line of the man page for <code>which</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WHICH</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>                  <span>BSD</span> <span>General</span> <span>Commands</span> <span>Manual</span>                 <span>WHICH</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>NAME</span>
     <span>which</span> <span>-- locate a program file in the user's path</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That means that if I were to execute <code>zsh</code> from my current shell a new instance
of zsh from <code>/usr/local/bin/zsh</code> would begin. This doesn't tell me the location
of the shell I'm currently typing in which started after opening Terminal.app.</p>
<h2>$SHELL</h2>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % echo $SHELL</span>
<span>/usr/local/bin/zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Eh, I don't know. That tells me that it's configured as my shell but does not
necessarily tell me the location of the shell I'm currently typing in.</p>
<h2>ps</h2>
<p>Maybe I can find the currently running process of the instance of zsh I'm in right now.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % ps </span>
<span>  PID TTY           TIME CMD</span>
<span>78525 ttys003    0:00.11 -zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Well that still doesn't give me the full path. And is that even the right
process? How do I get the PID of the shell I'm currently typing in? Turns out
there's a convenient shell variable <code>$$</code>.</p>



<p>Hmm, that's good I suppose, but I still don't know if the process with PID
<code>78525</code>, the one I'm currently typing in, is the correct zsh.</p>
<h2>lsof</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, I probably should have used <code>lsof</code> a long time ago but knowing how to
get the PID of the current shell makes things a bit easier.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~</span> <span>%</span> <span>lsof</span> <span>-</span><span>p</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>COMMAND</span>   <span>PID</span>  <span>USER</span>   <span>FD</span>   <span>TYPE</span> <span>DEVICE</span> <span>SIZE</span><span>/</span><span>OFF</span>                <span>NODE</span> <span>NAME</span>
<span>zsh</span>     <span>78525</span> <span>wally</span>  <span>cwd</span>    <span>DIR</span>    <span>1</span><span>,</span><span>5</span>     <span>1120</span>              <span>362897</span> <span>/</span><span>Users</span><span>/</span><span>wally</span>
<span>zsh</span>     <span>78525</span> <span>wally</span>  <span>txt</span>    <span>REG</span>    <span>1</span><span>,</span><span>5</span>   <span>614404</span>             <span>1052389</span> <span>/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>local</span><span>/</span><span>Cellar</span><span>/</span><span>zsh</span><span>/</span><span>5</span><span>.</span><span>7</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>zsh</span>

<span>...</span> <span>trimmed</span> <span>output</span> <span>...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Ahhh, finally! Not a single of instance of <code>/bin/zsh</code> in the output. I think
I'm pretty happy with this result.</p>
<h2>Are There Other Ways?</h2>
<p>But now I'm even more curious. Are there other ways to find this same
information? Turns out <code>apropos process</code> returned a few results but of the
bunch the only interesting find was <code>fuser</code>. </p>
<h2>fuser</h2>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % fuser /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.7.1/bin/zsh             </span>
<span>/usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.7.1/bin/zsh: 78525</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Neat. That PID matches <code>$$</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % fuser /bin/zsh</span>
<span>/bin/zsh: </span>
</pre></div>


<p>And no results for the pre-installed macOS version of <code>/bin/zsh</code>. </p>
<h2>macOS Activity Monitor</h2>
<p>If you want a more point-and-click way of finding the same information then
Activity Monitor has you covered. Make sure View &gt; Applications in last 12
hours is selected. Expand Terminal.app and double click zsh. Clicking the
Sample button on the bottom left gives you some detailed information about that
running process. </p>
<p><img alt="Screen shot showing layered windows of macOS Activity Monitor and a process sample output of zsh" src="https://nil.wallyjones.com/images/activity-monitor-zsh.png"></p>
<p>Fun fact: you can use the <code>sample</code> command for the same information.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finding the shell you're <em>actually</em> using isn't all that simple at first. You
can find the location of the executable of the shell. You can find all
the processes currently running with that shell name. But gathering information
about the shell you're typing all those commands in to find the shell you're
using requires a little more poking around. The two easiest solutions, on macOS
at least, are <code>lsof</code> and <code>fuser</code>. Activity Monitor also offers up a GUI for
finding the same information but you need to how to dig into it.</p>

<h2>Java Dictionary Class</h2>
<p>Java.util package provides a Dictionary class which is the abstract parent of any class, such as Hashtable, which maps keys to values. Every key and every value is an object. In any one Dictionary object, every key is associated with at most one value. Given a Dictionary and a key, the associated element can be looked up. Any non-null object can be used as a key and as a value.</p>


<h3>Class declaration</h3>
<p>The declaration of java.util.Dictionary class is:</p>
<div>
    
<pre>public abstract class Dictionary&lt;K,V&gt;
  extends Object
</pre>
</div>


<p>The java.util.Dictionary has a number of methods which are listed below:</p>

 

<table>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main">
      <p>This blog post explains the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> and the corresponding new PyTorch <a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="main-contributions">Main contributions</h2>
<p>We introduce a new energy function and a corresponding new update rule which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the energy function.</p>

<p>The new energy function is a generalization (discrete states \(\Rightarrow\) continuous states) of <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> aka <strong>Dense Associative Memories</strong> introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01929">Demircigil et al.</a>
The new modern Hopfield Network with continuous states keeps the characteristics of its discrete counterparts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exponential storage capacity</li>
  <li>extremely fast convergence</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprisingly, the new update rule is the attention mechanism of transformer networks introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>.
We use these new insights to analyze transformer models in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-blog-post-is-about">What this blog post is about</h2>

<p>This blog post is split into three parts. First, we make the transition from traditional Hopfield Networks towards <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> and their generalization to continuous states through our <strong>new energy function</strong>. Second, the properties of our new energy function and the connection to the self-attention mechanism of transformer networks is shown. Finally, we introduce and explain a new PyTorch layer (<a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>), which is built on the insights of our work. We show several practical use cases, i.e. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13505">Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire Classification</a>, Hopfield pooling, and associations of two sets.</p>

<h2 id="from-classical-hopfield-networks-to-self-attention">From classical Hopfield Networks to self-attention</h2>

<p><strong>Associative memories</strong> are one of the earliest artificial neural models dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Best known are <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">Hopfield Networks</a>, presented by John Hopfield in 1982.
As the name suggests, the main purpose of associative memory networks is to associate an input with its most similar pattern. In other words, the purpose is to store and retrieve patterns.
We start with a review of classical Hopfield Networks.</p>

<h3 id="hopfield-networks">Hopfield Networks</h3>

<p>The simplest associative memory is just a <strong>sum of outer products</strong> of the \(N\) patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) that we want to store (Hebbian learning rule). In classical Hopfield Networks these patterns are polar (binary), i.e. \(\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1 \}^d\), where \(d\) is the length of the patterns. The corresponding weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_i^N \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ . \tag{1}
\end{equation}\]

<p>The weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) stores the patterns, which can be retrieved starting with a <strong>state pattern</strong> \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Nomenclature</strong></p>

<p>From now on we denote the \(N\) <strong>stored patterns</strong> as \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) and any <strong>state pattern</strong> or <strong>state</strong> as \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>

<p>The basic <strong>synchronuous update rule</strong> is to repeatedly multiply the state pattern \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\), subtract the bias and take the sign:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} =  \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\xi}^t - \boldsymbol{b}) \ , \tag{2}
\label{eq:restorage}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is a bias vector, which can be interpreted as threshold for every component.
The <strong>asynchronous update rule</strong> performs this update only for one component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) and then selects the next component for update.
Convergence is reached if \(\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} = \boldsymbol{\xi^{t}}\).</p>

<p>The asynchronous version of the update rule of Eq. \eqref{eq:restorage} minimizes the <strong>energy function</strong> \(\text{E}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\text{E} = -\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\xi}^T \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^T\boldsymbol{b} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^d\sum_{j=1}^d w_{ij}\xi_i\xi_j + \sum_{i=1}^d b_i\xi_i \ . \tag{3}
\label{eq:energy_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>As derived in the papers of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=58341">Bruck</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X85900290">Goles-Chacc et al.</a> and <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">the original Hopfield paper</a>, the convergence properties are dependent on the structure of the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) and the method by which the nodes are updated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For asynchronous updates with \(w_{ii} \geq 0\) and \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state.</li>
  <li>For synchronous updates with \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state or a limit cycle of length 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the asynchronous update rule and symmetric weights, \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) \leq \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) holds. When \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) = \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) for the update of every component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^t\), a local minimum in \(\text{E}\) is reached.
All stored patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) should be fixed points of the Hopfield Network, i.e.</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x}_i = \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{b}) \ . \tag{4}
\end{equation}\]

<p>They should even be local minima of \(\text{E}\).</p>

<p>In the following example, no bias vector is used. This means that taking the inverse image, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</p>

<p>We start with an <strong>illustrative example</strong> of a Hopfield Network. <strong>One input image</strong> should first be stored and then be retrieved.
The input image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_original.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>Since an associative memory has <strong>polar states and patterns</strong> (or binary states and patterns), we convert the input image to a black and white image:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>The <strong>weight matrix</strong> \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is the outer product of this black and white image \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ , \tag{5}
\label{eq:weight_matrix}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where for this example \(d = 64 \times 64\).</p>

<p>Can the original image be restored if half of the pixels are masked out? The masked image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>which is our inital state \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\). This inital state is updated via multiplication with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\).
It takes one update until the original image is restored.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked_retrieved.png" alt="not found" width="600px"></p>

<p>What happens if we store <strong>more than one pattern</strong>? The weight matrix is then built from the sum of outer products of <strong>three stored patterns</strong> (three input images):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ . \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_6.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_12.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>In this figure, the left hand side shows the three stored patterns, and the right hand side shows masked state patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) together with the retrieved patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{\text{new}}\).</p>

<p>Looking at the upper row of images might suggest that the retrieval process is no longer perfect. But there are two interesting facts to take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Masking the original images introduces many pixel values of \(-1\). We therefore have the odd behavior that the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Bart}}\rangle\) is larger than the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\rangle\).</li>
  <li>As stated above, if no bias vector is used, the inverse of the pattern, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the retrieval of the upper image looks incorrect, it is de facto correct. However, for the lower row example, the retrieval is no longer correct.
The weights of \(2 \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Marge}}\) have simply overwritten the weights of \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\).
For both examples, only the retrieval after the first update step is shown, but the results do not change when performing further update steps.
The next figure shows the Hopfield Network retrieval for 6 patterns.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_115.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>Clearly, retrieving the patterns is imperfect. One might suspect that the limited storage capacities of Hopfield Networks, see <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.3548&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Amit et al.</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.061910">Torres et al</a>, is the problem.
However, we show now that the storage capacity is not directly responsible for the imperfect retrieval.
The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns free of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong \frac{d}{2\log(d)} \ , \tag{7}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(d\) is the dimension of the input.</p>

<p>The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong 0.14 d\ . \tag{8}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield2}
\end{equation}\]

<p>In the example, the storage capacity is \(C \cong 0.14 d = 0.14 \cdot 64 \cdot 64 \sim 570\).
Thus, insufficient storage capacity is not directly responsible for the retrieval errors.
Instead, the example patterns are correlated, therefore the retrieval has errors.</p>

<p>Consequently, we need a model which <strong>allows pulling apart close patterns</strong>, such that (strongly) <strong>correlated patterns can be distinguished</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>On storage capacity</strong></p>

<p>The storage capacities stated in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield} and in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield2} are derived for \(w_{ii}=0\).
Recently, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> analyzed the storage capacity for Hopfield Networks with \(w_{ii}\geq 0\). Also for \(w_{ii}\geq 0\), a storage capacity of \(C \cong 0.14 d\)
for retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors was observed. The ratio \(C/d\) is often called <strong>load parameter</strong> and denoted by \(\alpha\). <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> showed that there is a second regime with very large \(\alpha\), where the storage capacity is much higher, i.e. more fixed points exist. However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07741">Rocci et al.</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/8/726/htm">Gosti et al.</a> reported that these fixed points for very large \(\alpha\) are unstable and do not have an attraction basin.</p>

<h3 id="modern-hopfield-networks-aka-dense-associative-memories">Modern Hopfield Networks (aka Dense Associative Memories)</h3>

<p>The storage capacity is a crucial characteristic of Hopfield Networks. <strong>Modern Hopfield Networks</strong> (aka Dense Associative Memories) introduce a new energy function instead of the energy in Eq. \eqref{eq:energy_hopfield} to create a higher storage capacity. <strong>Discrete</strong> modern Hopfield Networks have been introduced first by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> …</p></div></div>

		<p>In my previous posts on loss aversion (<a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/09/10/kahneman-and-tverskys-debatable-loss-aversion-assumption/">here</a>, <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/11/06/what-can-we-infer-about-someone-who-rejects-a-5050-bet-to-win-110-or-lose-100-the-rabin-paradox-explored/">here</a> and <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/12/05/the-case-against-loss-aversion/">here</a>), I foreshadowed a post on how “ergodicity economics” might shed some light on whether we need loss aversion to explain people’s choices under uncertainty. This was to be that post, but the background material that I drafted is long enough to be a stand alone piece. I’ll turn to the application of ergodicity economics to loss aversion in a future post.</p>
<p>The below is largely drawn from presentations and papers by <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/">Ole Peters</a> and <a href="http://lml.org.uk/research/economics/">friends</a>, with my own evolutionary take at the end. For a deeper dive, see the <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/lecture-notes/">lecture notes by Peters and Alexander Adamou</a>, or a recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0732-0">Perspective by Peters in Nature Physics</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The choice</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 and are offered a gamble involving a series of coin flips. For each flip, heads will increase your wealth by 50%. Tails will decrease it by 40%. Flip 100 times.</p>
<p><strong>The expected payoff</strong></p>
<p>What will happen? For that first flip, you have a 50% chance of a $50 gain, and a 50% chance of a $40 loss. Your expected gain (each outcome weighted by its probability, 0.5*$50 + 0.5*-$40) is $5 or 5% of your wealth. The absolute size of the stake for future flips will depend on past flips, but for every flip you have the same expected gain of 5% of your wealth.</p>
<p>Should you take the bet?</p>
<p>I simulated 10,000 people who each started with $100 and flipped the coin 100 times each. This line in Figure 1 represents the mean wealth of the 10,000 people. It looks good, increasing roughly in accordance with the expected gain, despite some volatility, and finishing at a mean wealth of over $16,000.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1: Average wealth of population</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_1.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 1"></p>
<p>Yet people regularly decline gambles of this nature. Are they making a mistake?</p>
<p>One explanation for declining this gamble is risk aversion. A risk averse person will value the expected outcome of a gamble lower than the same sum with certainty.</p>
<p>Risk aversion can be represented through the concept of utility, where each level of wealth gives subjective value (utility) for the gambler. If people maximise utility instead of the value of a gamble, it is possible that a person would reject the bet.</p>
<p>For example, one common utility function to represent a risk averse individual is to take the logarithm of each level of wealth. If we apply the log utility function to the gamble above, the gambler will reject the offer of the coin flip. [The maths here is simply that the expected utility of the gamble is 0.5*<em>ln</em>(150) + 0.5*<em>ln</em>(60)=4.55, which is less than the utility of the sure $100, <em>ln</em>(100)=4.61.]</p>
<p><strong>The time average growth rate</strong></p>
<p>For a different perspective, below is the plot for the first 20 of these 10,000 people. Interestingly, only two people do better than break even (represented by the black line at $100). The richest has less than $1,000 at period 100.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Path of first 20 people</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_2.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 2"></p>
<p>What is happening here? The first plot shows that the average wealth across all 10,000 people is increasing. When we look at the first 20 individuals, their wealth generally declines. Even those that make money make less than the gain in aggregate wealth would suggest.</p>
<p>To show this more starkly, here is a plot of the first 20 people on a log scale, together with the average wealth for the full population. They are all below average in final wealth.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3: Plot of first 20 people against average wealth (log scale)</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_3.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 3"></p>
<p>If we examine the full population of 10,000, we see an interesting pattern. The mean wealth is over $16,000, but the median wealth after 100 periods is 51 cents, a loss of over 99% of the initial wealth. 54% of the population ends up with less than $1. 86% finishes with less than the initial wealth of $100. Yet 171 people end up with more than $10,000. The wealthiest person finishes with $117 million, which is over 70% of the total wealth of the population.</p>
<p>For most people, the series of bets is a disaster. It looks good only on average, propped up by the extreme good luck and massive wealth of a few people. The expected payoff does not match the experience of most people.</p>
<p><strong><em>Four possible outcomes</em></strong></p>
<p>One way to think about what is happening is to consider the four possible outcomes over the first two periods.</p>
<p>The first person gets two heads. They finish with $225. The second and third person get a heads and a tails (in different orders), and finish with $90. The fourth person ends up with $36.</p>
<p>The average across the four is $110.25, reflecting the compound 5% growth. That’s our positive picture. But three of the four lost money. As the number of flips increases, the proportion who lose money increases, with a rarer but more extraordinarily rich cohort propping up the average.</p>
<p><strong><em>Almost surely</em></strong></p>
<p>Over the very long-term, an individual will tend to get around half heads and half tails. As the number of flips goes to infinite, the number of heads and tails is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">almost surely</a>” equal.</p>
<p>This means that each person will tend to get a 50% increase half the time (or 1.5 times the initial wealth), and a 40% decrease half the time (60% of the initial wealth). A bit of maths and the time average growth in wealth for an individual is (1.5*0.6)<sup>0.5</sup> ~ 0.95, or approximately a 5% decline in wealth each period. Every individual’s wealth will tend to decay at that rate.</p>
<p>To get an intuition for this, a long run of equal numbers of heads and tails is equivalent to flipping a head and a tail every two periods. Suppose that is exactly what you did – flipped a heads and then flipped a tail. Your wealth would increase to $150 in the first round ($100*1.5), and then decline to $90 in the second ($150*0.6). You get the same result if you change the order. Effectively, you are losing 10% (or getting only 1.5*0.6=0.9) of your money every two periods.</p>
<p>A system where the time average converges to the ensemble average (our population mean) is known as an ergodic system. The system of gambles above is non-ergodic as the time average and the ensemble average diverge. And given we cannot individually experience the ensemble average, we should not be misled by it. The focus on ensemble averages, as is typically done in economics, can be misleading if the system is non-ergodic.</p>
<p><strong><em>The longer term</em></strong></p>
<p>How can we reconcile this expectation of loss when looking at the time average growth with the continued growth of the wealth of some people after 100 periods? It does not seem that everyone is “almost surely” on the path to ruin.</p>
<p>But they are. If we plot the simulation for, say, 1,000 periods rather than 100, there are few winners. Here’s a plot of the average wealth of the population for 1000 periods (the first 100 being as previously shown), plus a log plot of that same growth (Figures 4 and 5).</p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_4.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 4"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods (log plot)</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_5.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 5"></p>
<p>We can see that despite a large peak in wealth around period 400, wealth ultimately plummets. Average wealth at period 1000 is $24, below the starting average of $100, with a median wealth of 1×10<sup>-21</sup> (rounding to the nearest cent, that is zero). The wealthiest person has $242 thousand dollars, with that being 98.5% of the total wealth. If we followed that wealthy person for another 1000 generations, I would expect them to be wiped out too. [I tested that – at 2000 periods the wealthiest person had $4×10<sup>-7</sup>.] Despite the positive expected value, the wealth of the entire population is wiped out.</p>
<p><strong>Losing wealth on a positive value bet</strong></p>
<p>The first 100 periods of bets forces us to hold a counterintuitive idea in our minds. While the population as an aggregate experiences outcomes reflecting the positive expected value of the bet, the typical person does not. The increase in wealth across the aggregate population is only due to the extreme wealth of a few lucky people.</p>
<p>However, the picture over 1000 periods appears even more confusing. The positive expected value of the bet is nowhere to be seen. How could this be the case?</p>
<p>The answer to this lies in the distribution of bets. After 100 periods, one person had 70% of the wealth. We no longer have 10,000 equally weighted independent bets as we did in the first round. Instead, the path of the wealth of the population is largely subject to the outcome of the bets by this wealthy individual. As we have already shown, the wealth path for an individual almost surely leads to a compound 5% loss of wealth. That individual’s wealth is on borrowed time. The only way for someone to maintain their wealth would be to bet a smaller portion of their wealth, or to diversify their wealth across multiple bets.</p>
<p><strong>The Kelly criterion</strong></p>
<p>On the first of these options, the portion of a person’s wealth they should enter as stakes for a positive expected value bet such as this is given by the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>. The Kelly criterion gives the bet size that would maximise the geometric growth rate in wealth.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion formula for a simple bet is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3D%5Cfrac%7Bbp-q%7D%7Bb%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7Bp%28b%2B1%29-1%7D%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" alt="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}" title="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}"></p>
<p>where</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <em>f</em> is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager</p>
<p>  <em>b</em> is the net odds received on the wager (i.e. you receive $b back on top of the $1 wagered for the bet)</p>
<p>  <em>p</em> is the probability of winning</p>
<p>  <em>q</em> is the probability of losing (1-p)
</p></blockquote>
<p>For the bet above, we have <em>p</em>=0.5 and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D%5Cfrac%7B0.5%7D%7B0.4%7D%3D1.25&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25" title="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25">. As offered, we are effectively required to bet <em>f</em>=0.4, or 40% of our wealth, for that chance to win a 50% increase.</p>
<p>However, if we apply the above formula given <em>p</em> and <em>b</em>, a person should bet <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%280.5%2A%281.25%2B1%29-1%29%7D%7B1.25%7D%3D0.1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1" title="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1">, or 10%, of their wealth each round to maximise the geometric growth rate.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion is effectively maximising the expected log utility of the bet through setting the size of the bet. The Kelly criterion will result in someone wanting to take a share of any bet with positive expected value.</p>
<p>The Kelly bet “almost surely”” leads to higher wealth than any other strategy in the long run.</p>
<p>If we simulate the above scenarios, but risking only 10% of wealth each round rather than 40% (i.e. heads wealth will increase by 12.5%, tails it will decrease by 10%), what happens? The expected value of the Kelly bet is 0.5*0.125+0.5*-0.1=0.0125 …</p></div></div>

<p>Our U.S. dollar (USD) purchasing power is plummeting by the day, people!</p>



<p>It seems like only yesterday that we could exchange $15 for an ounce of silver. Now, we need to exchange nearly $30 for an ounce of silver. Evidently, Yogi Berra was not wrong when he quipped, “<em>a nickel ain’t worth a dime anymore</em>.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="653" height="607" src="https://coventryleague.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/silver-price_2020-08-06_intraday.jpg" alt="Silver price per ounce on 06-August-2020.

<p>Will we see $50 per ounce soon? Coventry League has commented about <a href="https://coventryleague.com/blogentary/quarter-billion-dollar-man/" target="_blank" aria-label="gold and fiat currency (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">gold and fiat currency</a> in the past. The blog ZeroHedge also asked a similar question a week or so ago: “<em>Which comes first: gold $3000 or silver $50 (thanks to @neelkashkari for making this question possible)</em>.”</p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Which comes first: gold $3000 or silver $50 (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/neelkashkari?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@neelkashkari</a> for making this question possible). <a href="https://t.co/7QRZ1fPsEU" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/7QRZ1fPsEU</a></p>— zerohedge (@zerohedge) <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1287788828749635587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">July 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<p>Fortunately, at least half-dozen states have passed legislation recognizing <a href="https://gsiexchange.com/rules-of-gold/" target="_blank" aria-label="gold and silver legal tender (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">gold and silver legal tender</a>.</p>

<p>Utah, South Carolina, and Oklahoma have been the “gold standard” in setting legal precedent for returning to gold and silver legal tender. Congrats, by the way, to the newcomer on the list, “Take Me Home, Country Roads” West Virginia.</p>

you work faster!</p>

<h3 id="insert-multiple-rows-in-one-statement">Insert Multiple Rows In One Statement</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement can insert more than one row in a single statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>planets</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>gravity</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'earth'</span><span>,</span>    <span>9</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'mars'</span><span>,</span>     <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>7</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'jupiter'</span><span>,</span> <span>23</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Read more about what INSERT can do <a href="https://pgdash.io/blog/postgres-insert.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="insert-a-row-and-return-automatically-assigned-values">Insert a Row and Return Automatically-assigned Values</h3>

<p>Values auto-generated with DEFAULT/serial/IDENTITY constructs can be returned
by the INSERT statement using the RETURNING clause. From the application
code perspective, such an INSERT is executed like a SELECT that returns a
recordset.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- table with 2 column values auto-generated on INSERT</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>slno</span>       <span>serial</span>      <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span>       <span>text</span>        <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>created_at</span> <span>timestamptz</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>slno</span><span>,</span> <span>created_at</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--      name     | slno |          created_at</span>
<span>-- --------------+------+-------------------------------</span>
<span>--  wooden axe   |    1 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  loom         |    2 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  eye of ender |    3 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="autogenerated-uuid-primary-keys">Autogenerated UUID Primary Keys</h3>

<p>UUIDs are sometimes used instead of primary keys for various reasons. Here is
how you can use an UUID instead of a serial or IDENTITY:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span>    <span>uuid</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>name</span>  <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>;</span>
  
<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--                   id                  |     name</span>
<span>-- --------------------------------------+--------------</span>
<span>--  1cfaae8c-61ff-4e82-a656-99263b7dd0ae | wooden axe</span>
<span>--  be043a89-a51b-4d8b-8378-699847113d46 | loom</span>
<span>--  927d52eb-c175-4a97-a0b2-7b7e81d9bc8e | eye of ender</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-if-not-existing-update-otherwise">Insert If Not Existing, Update Otherwise</h3>

<p>In Postgres 9.5 and later, you can <em>upsert</em> directly using the ON CONFLICT
construct:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>key</span>   <span>TEXT</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>-- when "key" causes a constraint violation, update the "value"</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> 
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'port'</span><span>,</span> <span>'5432'</span><span>)</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>CONFLICT</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>DO</span>
            <span>UPDATE</span> <span>SET</span> <span>value</span><span>=</span><span>EXCLUDED</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="copy-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Copy Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement has a form where the values can be supplied by a SELECT
statement. Use this to copy rows from one table into another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy between tables with similar columns </span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>pending_quests</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>progress</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- supply some values from another table, some directly</span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>archived_quests</span>
       <span>SELECT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>AS</span> <span>archival_date</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span>
         <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>completed</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’re looking to bulk-load tables, also check out the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html">COPY command</a>,
which can be used to insert rows from a text or CSV file.</p>

<h3 id="delete-and-return-deleted-information">Delete and Return Deleted Information</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>RETURNING</code> clause to return values from the rows that were
deleted using a bulk-delete statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- return the list of customers whose licenses were deleted after expiry</span>
<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>licenses</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>expiry_date</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>customer_name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="move-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Move Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>You can move rows from one table to another in a single statement, by using CTEs
with <em>DELETE .. RETURNING</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- move yet-to-start todo items from 2020 to 2021</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>ah_well</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>todos_2020</span>
          <span>WHERE</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>started</span>
      <span>RETURNING</span> <span>*</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>todos_2021</span>
            <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>ah_well</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="update-rows-and-return-updated-values">Update Rows and Return Updated Values</h3>

<p>The RETURNING clause can be used in UPDATEs too. Note that only the new
values of the updated columns can be returned this way.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- grant random amounts of coins to eligible players</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>coins</span> <span>=</span> <span>coins</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>random</span><span>())::</span><span>integer</span>
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>eligible</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>coins</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you need the original value of the updated columns: it is possible through a
self-join, but there is no guarantee of atomicity. Try using a <code>SELECT .. FOR
UPDATE</code> instead.</p>

<h3 id="update-a-few-random-rows-and-return-the-updated-ones">Update a Few Random Rows and Return The Updated Ones</h3>

<p>Here’s how you can choose a few random rows from a table, update them and
return the updated ones, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>WITH</span> <span>lucky_few</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span>
      <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span>
  <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>random</span><span>()</span>
     <span>LIMIT</span> <span>5</span>
<span>)</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>=</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> 
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>lucky_few</span><span>)</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-a-table-just-like-another-table">Create a Table Just Like Another Table</h3>

<p>Use the CREATE TABLE .. LIKE construct to create a table with the same columns
as another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By default this does not create similar indexes, constraints, defaults etc. To
do that, ask Postgres explicitly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span> <span>INCLUDING</span> <span>ALL</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See the full syntax <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="extract-a-random-set-of-rows-into-another-table">Extract a Random Set of Rows Into Another Table</h3>

<p>Since Postgres 9.5, the TABLESAMPLE feature is available to extract a sample of
rows from a table. There are two sampling methods currently, and <em>bernoulli</em> is
usually the one you want:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy 10% of today's purchases into another table</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>to_be_audited</span>
     <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
       <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
<span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <em>system</em> tablesampling method is faster, but does not return a uniform
distribution. See the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM">docs</a>
for more info.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-table-from-a-select-query">Create a Table From a Select Query</h3>

<p>You can use the CREATE TABLE .. AS construct to create the table and populate
it from a SELECT query, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>AS</span>
      <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
        <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
 <span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
       <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The resultant table is like a materialized view without a query associated with
it. Read more about <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">CREATE TABLE .. AS here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="create-unlogged-tables">Create Unlogged Tables</h3>

<p><em>Unlogged</em> tables are not backed by WAL records. This means that updates and
deletes to such tables are faster, but they are not crash-tolerant and cannot
be replicated.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>report_20200817</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-temporary-tables">Create Temporary Tables</h3>

<p><em>Temporary</em> tables are implicitly unlogged tables, with a shorter lifetime. They
automatically self-destruct at the end of a session (default), or at the end
of the transaction.</p>

<p>Data within temporary tables cannot be shared across sessions. Multiple sessions
can create temporary tables with the same name.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- temp table for duration of the session</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- temp table that will self-destruct after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                      <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                      <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DROP</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- temp table that will TRUNCATE itself after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>ROWS</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>



<p>Comments can be added to any object in the database. Many tools, including
pg_dump, understand these. A useful comment might just avoid a ton of trouble
during cleanup!</p>

<h3 id="advisory-locks">Advisory Locks</h3>

<p>Advisory locks can be used to co-ordinate actions between two apps connected to
the <em>same</em> database. You can use this feature to implement a global, distributed
mutex for a certain operation, for example. Read all about it <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS">here in the
docs</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- client 1: acquire a lock </span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- ... do work ...</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_unlock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- client 2: tries to do the same thing, but mutually exclusive</span>
<span>-- with client 1</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span> <span>-- blocks if anyone else has held lock with id 130</span>

<span>-- can also do it without blocking:</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_try_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- returns false if lock is being held by another client</span>
<span>-- otherwise acquires the lock then returns true</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregate-into-arrays-json-arrays-or-strings">Aggregate Into Arrays, JSON Arrays or Strings</h3>

<p>Postgres provides aggregate functions that concatenate values in a <em>GROUP</em> to
yield arrays, JSON arrays or strings:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- get names of each guild, with an array of ids of players that</span>
<span>-- belong to that guild</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- same but the player list is a CSV string</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but the player list is a JSONB array</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>jsonb_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but returns a nice JSONB object like so:</span>
<span>-- { guild1: [ playerid1, playerid2, .. ], .. }</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>jsonb_object_agg</span><span>(</span><span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>players</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>q</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregates-with-order">Aggregates With Order</h3>

<p>While we’re on the topic, here’s how to set the order of values that are passed
to the aggregate function, <em>within each group</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- each state with a list of counties sorted alphabetically</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>states</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>counties</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>state_name</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Yes, there is a trailing ORDER BY clause inside the function call paranthesis.
Yes, the syntax is weird.</p>

<h3 id="array-and-unnest">Array and Unnest</h3>

<p>Use the ARRAY constructor to convert a set of rows, each with one column, into
an array.  The database driver (like JDBC) should be able to map Postgres arrays
into native arrays and might be easier to work with.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- convert rows (with 1 column each) into a 1-dimensional array</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>lifetime_spen…</span></code></pre></figure></div></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>CMake is one of the most convenient building tools for C/C++ projects. When it comes to <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_include_directories.html"><code>target_include_directories</code></a> and <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html"><code>target_link_libraries</code></a>, there are several keywords, <code>PUBLIC</code>, <code>PRIVATE</code>, and <code>INTERFACE</code>, that I got confused about from time to time even if I have read the related official documentations. So When I was building my C/C++ projects using CMake, I often just use <code>PUBLIC</code> everywhere or leave the keyword blank (CMake will then use <code>PUBLIC</code> by default), the libraries and executables built from the projects would work in most of the scenarios. However, it is certainly not best practice.</p>



<p>Today, I read Kuba Sejdak’s blog post <a href="https://kubasejdak.com/modern-cmake-is-like-inheritance">“Modern CMake is Like Inheritance”</a> and I found his interpretation on the CMake keywords <code>PUBLIC</code>, <code>PRIVATE</code>, and <code>INTERFACE</code> inspiring. So in this blog post, I would like to discuss some of my thoughts on these CMake keywords from the perspective of “inheritance”.</p>

<h3 id="c-inheritance">C++ Inheritance</h3>

<h4 id="access-specifiers">Access Specifiers</h4>

<p>In C++ object oriented programming, there are three types of access specifiers for classes.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Access Specifier</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>Members are accessible from outside the class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>protected</td>
    <td>Members cannot be accessed from outside the class. However, they can be accessed in inherited classes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>private</td>
    <td>Members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Alternatively, this could be described using the following simplified table.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Access Specifier</th>
    <th>Same Class</th>
    <th>Derived Class</th>
    <th>Outside Class</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>protected</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span>private</span></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="inheritance-types">Inheritance Types</h4>

<p>When it comes to class inheritance, there are also three types of inheritances.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Inheritance Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>Public members of the base class become public members of the derived class and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class. A base class's private members are never accessible directly from a derived class, but can be accessed through calls to the public and protected members of the base class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span>protected</span></td>
    <td>Public and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>private</td>
    <td>Public and protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class.<br></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Alternatively, this could be described using the following simplified table.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Inheritance Type</th>
    <th>base: public member</th>
    <th><span>base: </span>protected <span>member</span></th>
    <th><span>base: </span>private <span>member</span></th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>public</td>
    <td>derived: public member</td>
    <td><span>derived: </span>protected member</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>protected</td>
    <td><span>derived: </span>protected <span>member</span></td>
    <td><span>derived:</span> protected <span>member</span></td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>private</td>
    <td><span>derived:</span> private <span>member</span></td>
    <td><span>derived:</span> private <span>member</span></td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="cmake-inheritance">CMake Inheritance</h3>

<p>CMake uses somewhat similar inheritance concepts to C++, especially for the C++ <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> access specifiers and inheritance types. The CMake keywords <code>PUBLIC</code>, <code>PRIVATE</code>, and <code>INTERFACE</code> used in <code>target_include_directories</code> and <code>target_link_libraries</code>, in my opinion, are mixtures of access specifier and inheritance type from C++.</p>

<h4 id="include-inheritance">Include Inheritance</h4>

<p>In CMake, for any <code>target</code>, in the preprocessing stage, it comes with a <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> and a <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> for searching the header files building. <code>target_include_directories</code> will populate all the directories to <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> and/or <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> depending on the keyword <code>&lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt;</code> we specified. The <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> will be used for the current <code>target</code> only and the <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> will be appended to the <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of any other <code>target</code> which has dependencies on the current <code>target</code>. With such settings, the configurations of <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> and <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> for all building targets are easy to compute and scale up even for multiple hierarchical layers of building dependencies and many building targets.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Include Inheritance</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>PUBLIC</td>
    <td>All the directories following PUBLIC will be used for the current target and <span>the other targets that have dependencies on the current target, i.e., appending the directories to </span>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PRIVATE</td>
    <td><span>All the include directories following PRIVATE will be used for the current target only</span>, i.e., appending the directories to <span>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>INTERFACE</td>
    <td><span>All the include directories following INTERFACE</span> will NOT be used for the current target but will be accessible for the other targets that have dependencies on the current target<span>, i.e., appending the directories to </span>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that when we do <code>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; &lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt; &lt;item&gt;)</code>, the dependent <code>&lt;item&gt;</code>, if built in the same CMake project, would append the <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> to the <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>&lt;target&gt;</code>. By controlling the <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code>, we could eliminate some unwanted or conflicting declarations from <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;target&gt;</code>.</p>



<p>For example, the <code>fruit</code> library has <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>fruit_h</code>, <code>tree_h</code>, and <code>INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> of <code>fruit_h</code>. If there is a <code>apple</code> library that is linked with the <code>fruit</code> library, the <code>apple</code> library would also have the <code>fruit_h</code> in its <code>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code> as well. We could equivalently say, the <code>apple</code> library’s include directory inherited the <code>fruit_h</code> of the  <code>fruit</code> library.</p>

<h4 id="link-inheritance">Link Inheritance</h4>

<p>Similarly, for any <code>target</code>, in the linking stage, we would need to decide, given the <code>item</code> to be linked, whether we have to put the <code>item</code> in the link dependencies, or the link interface, or both, in the compiled <code>target</code>. Here the link dependencies means the <code>item</code> has some implementations that the <code>target</code> would use, and it is linked to the <code>item</code>, so that whenever we call the functions or methods corresponding to those implementations it will always be mapped correctly to the implementations in <code>item</code> via the link, whereas the link interface means the <code>target</code> becomes an interface for linking the <code>item</code> for other targets which have dependencies on the <code>target</code>, and the <code>target</code> does not have to use <code>item</code> at all.</p>



<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Link Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>PUBLIC</td>
    <td>All the objects following PUBLIC will be used for linking to the current target and providing the interface to the other targets that have dependencies on the current target.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PRIVATE</td>
    <td><span>All the objects following </span>PRIVATE will only be used for linking to the current target.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>INTERFACE</td>
    <td><span>All the objects following </span>INTERFACE will only be used for providing the interface to the other targets that have dependencies on the current target.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>For example, if the <code>fruit</code> library has the implementation of functions, such as <code>size</code> and <code>color</code>, and the <code>apple</code> library has a function <code>apple_size</code> which called the <code>size</code> from the <code>fruit</code> library and was <code>PRIVATE</code> linked with the <code>fruit</code> library. We could create an executable <code>eat_apple</code> that calls <code>apple_size</code> by <code>PUBLIC</code> or <code>PRIVATE</code> linking with the <code>apple</code> library. However, if we want to create an executable <code>eat_apple</code> that calls the <code>size</code> and <code>color</code> from the <code>fruit</code> library, only linking with the <code>apple</code> library will cause building error, since the <code>fruit</code> library was not part of the interface in the <code>apple</code> library, and is thus inaccessible to <code>eat_apple</code>. To make the <code>apple</code> library to inherit the <code>size</code> and <code>color</code> from the <code>fruit</code> library, we have to make the linking of the <code>apple</code> library to the the <code>fruit</code> library <code>PUBLIC</code> instead of <code>PRIVATE</code>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>The CMake builds a hierarchical project via the include interface or link interface. The “inheritance” mechanism in C++ is built upon the include interface or link interface.</p>

<h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>

<h4 id="how-to-understand-cmake-interface">How to Understand CMake Interface?</h4>

<p>In my understanding, CMake interface is just like a telephone switch station in old times.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-08-08-CMake-Public-Private-Interface/medienwandel-chicago-union-station-telegraph-switchboard.jpg">
    <figcaption>Telephone Switch Station</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>If <code>A</code> wants to call <code>B</code> and there is no direct telephone cable connection between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, <code>A</code> has to call a telephone switch station that has connection to <code>B</code> and the personal in the telephone switch station will connect <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> by jointing the cable of <code>A</code> and the cable of <code>B</code> together. If the telephone switch station does not know there is a <code>B</code>, it is impossible to get <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> connected. So CMake interface is simply a registration in the telephone switch station. When there is a dependency in CMake targets, targets from different levels of hierarchy are connected via interfaces, for both <code>include</code> and <code>link</code>.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-key-points-for-this-blog-post">What are the Key Points for This Blog Post?</h4>

<p><code>PRIVATE</code> only cares about himself and does not allow inheritance. <code>INTERFACE</code> only cares about others and allows inheritance. <code>PUBLIC</code> cares about everyone and allows inheritance.</p>

<h4 id="is-public-private-interface-part-of-the-gccg-compiler">Is PUBLIC, PRIVATE, INTERFACE Part of the GCC/G++ Compiler?</h4>

<p>No. Compilers, such as <code>gcc</code> and <code>g++</code>, do not have such mechanism. CMake invented those keywords for user to create a building graph that has very clear and explicit dependencies. The building graph translates to normal building commands using <code>gcc</code> and <code>g++</code>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Neuralink Live Demonstration Shows the Potential and Infancy of the Link Device</strong></p><p>From the Neuralink headquarters, Elon Musk and the team at Neuralink demonstrated a working version of their "version 0.9" Link device in a presentation that showed off the current hardware, the surgical implant process, and the data it can currently collect. According to Musk, the presentation was designed primarily to promote recruitment at Neuralink, looking to convince good people to work at Neuralink. </p><p>Musk's stated goal for Neuralink is to solve important brain and spine problems. By creating a generalized brain device that is reliable and affordable, the plan is to be able to treat any neurological problem that someone might have during their life, from hearing loss to memory loss to depression and anxiety. Because senses consist of electrical signals sent by neurons to your brain, if the Neuralink can correct those signals, it can can potentially solve any brain problem. </p><p><strong>What is the device?</strong></p><p>The v0.9 "Link" device demonstrated is a coin-sized computing device which is designed to be implanted into the wearer's head - replacing a piece of the skull. The Link is equipped with sensors found in most of today's cell phones and wearable devices such as inertial measurement, temperature and pressure sensors. It's equipped with a battery designed to last a full day that can be charged wirelessly (through induction) to allow easy recharging at night while the wearer is asleep. </p><p>Attached to the circular part of the devices are many electrodes called threads that can both send signals to neurons in the brain and read the electrical signals sent by the neurons. Each thread is 1/20th the diameter of a single strand of hair. As Musk described it, "In a lot of ways, it's kind of like a Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires."</p><figure><img src="https://www.brainhackernews.com/content/images/2020/08/v0.9.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.brainhackernews.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/v0.9.png 600w, https://www.brainhackernews.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/v0.9.png 1000w, https://www.brainhackernews.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/v0.9.png 1600w, https://www.brainhackernews.com/content/images/2020/08/v0.9.png 2076w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>How is it installed?</strong></p><p>By a surgical robot, of course. The robot was also on display, and has been used to implant the Link device in pigs. Eventually the the robot will be used for the entire surgical process once it is approved for human use. That process consists of first removing the skull fragment, then installing the electrodes into the brain. The robot is used because of the precision required to install the threads into the correct location. When installed with that level of precision, no bleeding in the brain occurs because all blood vessels are avoided. This is made possible by imaging taken of the brain, which the robot uses to guide its installation of the threads. </p><p>Currently the threads can only be attached to the cortical surface (outer layer of the brain), but there are plans to be able to implant the threads at arbitrary depths. Once the threads are placed, the device is implanted and the wound is super glued shut. &nbsp;The surgery itself is not long. Musk said that patients will be able to leave the hospital the same day, and if the device is implanted underneath the patient's hair, it will not be visible. </p><p>The device was approved as a breakthrough technology by the FDA in July, and according to Musk, the device will significantly exceed the FDA's safety standards. Human trials are pending FDA approvals and further safety testing. </p><p><strong>What does the device do?</strong></p><p>By reading and writing electrical signals into the brain, the Link is able to detect the spike of electrical activity created by neurons as well as induce them to fire. These neuronal spikes are the primary method of communication for neurons in the brain, so by reading them and creating them, the Link can decipher what the brain is doing, and make it do things through stimulation. </p><p>In his "Three Little Pigs" demo, Musk showed one pig without the device implanted, a second with the device implanted, and a third which had the device implanted then removed (to demonstrate that it's safe to remove permanently or upgrade). There was no discernible difference between the pigs, except for data that was being transmitted by the pig with the Link implanted. The neuronal spikes were displayed on a graph in real-time as the pig walked around its pen and were translated into beeps that would grow louder and faster as the pig interacted with the environment with its snout. </p><p>A recorded demo showed that when the Link was used to capture electrical activity from a pig walking on a treadmill, it was possible to decipher the pigs movements with a high level of accuracy. </p><p><strong>Where is the technology headed?</strong></p><p>The initial treatment targets of the team are restoring movement and communication in spinal cord injury patients. According to Musk, the first version of the device installed only in the outer layer of the cortical surface, should be able to to solve blindness, hearing loss and paralysis. </p><p>It will eventually be possible to connect the device to an app on the wearer's smartphone and interface with the device for monitoring health data and sending signals, even possibly playing music directly into your brain. During the Q&amp;A portion of the event, the topic of gaming came up, and the team stated their functional target was to allow a quadriplegic to play StarCraft. &nbsp;When asked if the Link could be used to summon a Tesla with a thought, Musk answered yes unequivocally, but there's no telling when that will actually be possible. </p><p>The first version of the device will be expensive, but Musk hopes to reduce the cost to several thousand dollars inclusive of surgery to be as affordable as LASIK surgery. </p><p>You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVvmgjBL74w">official live stream</a> of the event to learn more.</p>

          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Starting from version <em>0.8.10.1</em>, LiquidHaskell is available as a GHC Plugin. Paying special attention to support existing IDE tooling led to some non-conventional design choices.</p>
<p><a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog">LiquidHaskell</a> is a <em>refinement type checker</em> for Haskell that empowers programmers to express contracts about their programs which are checked at compile time, and it has been a wonderful tool for the community in addition to GHC, when the latter is not enough. LiquidHaskell has been historically available only as a standalone executable which accepted one Haskell file at a time, making the process of integrating it into an existing code base more tricky than it should have been.</p>
<p>In this blog post we’ll explore how we turned LiquidHaskell into a GHC Plugin, and all the challenges we had to overcome along the way.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This post is intended as an extended cut of my <a href="https://icfp20.sigplan.org/details/hiw-2020-papers/1/Liquid-Haskell-as-a-GHC-Plugin">HIW talk</a>, and it nicely complements Ranjit’s more practical <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/2020/08/20/lh-as-a-ghc-plugin.lhs/">blog post</a>. We won’t cover here what LiquidHaskell (<em>LH</em> for brevity) can bring to the table on top of GHC’s type-level programming, as there are plenty of resources out there to get you excited: we recommend starting from the <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-tutorial/">book</a> for a practical motivation on why LiquidHaskell even needs to exist. The official <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog">website</a> also covers a lot of material.</p>
<p>What we will do instead is to briefly recap how LH looks like, as well as presenting its internal architecture. After that, we will take a look at the old version of LH in order to understand its shortcomings, and how the plugin helped overcoming those. Last but not least we will explore the iterations of the various designs of our plugin.</p>
<h3 id="a-liquid-haskell-hello-world">A Liquid Haskell “hello world”</h3>
<p>If you have <em>never</em> seen how LiquidHaskell looks like in practice, let’s assume we want to check (i.e.&nbsp;<em>refine</em>) a Haskell module, say <code>A.hs</code>. The content of <code>A.hs</code> is not important, but as an example let’s suppose it to be:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>module</span> <span>A</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a><span>import</span> <span>B</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a><span>import</span> <span>C</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6"></a><span>{-@ safeDiv :: Int -&gt; {y:Int | y /= 0 } -&gt; Int @-}</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7"></a><span>safeDiv ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8"></a>safeDiv <span>=</span> <span>div</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first line of the code block, which looks like a Haskell comment with additional <code>@</code>s, is a Liquid Haskell annotation. All Liquid Haskell instructions are written in special Haskell comments like this. This particular one assigns a refined type to <code>safeDiv</code>, and it’s essentially enforcing that the second <code>Int</code> we pass to <code>safeDiv</code> should <em>not</em> be 0. The <code>{y: Int | y /= 0}</code> also shows quite succinctly the essence of a <em>refinement type</em>, i.e.&nbsp;a type with a <strong>logical predicate</strong> attached to it. Now, if we try to attempt a division by 0, for example by calling <code>safeDiv 3 0</code>, LH would reject our program with a big red <code>UNSAFE</code> printed on screen, while if all is well a nice green <code>SAFE</code> would be shown.</p>
<p>Users can provide such annotations in a number of ways; they can annotate directly the Haskell source files, like in the example, or they can put all their refinements into a separate <code>.spec</code> file. Doing both <em>at the same time</em> (for the same module) is also supported, as LH will ensure that all these refinements will be merged into a single data structure, as we will see below.</p>
<h3 id="liquidhaskells-architecture">LiquidHaskell’s architecture</h3>
<p>Before deep-diving into any other section, let’s take a brief detour to explain how LH internally works, as it will help clarify some concepts later on. As usual, a picture is worth 1000 words:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/alfredo/lh-as-a-ghc-plugin/lh_architecture.png"></p>
<p>Let’s break down this picture bit by bit. The first thing that LH does is to parse the annotations from the input file (<code>A.hs</code>) and from the companion <code>.spec</code> file (if any, thus the dashed lines in the picture), converting everything into a richer data structure known as a <code>BareSpec</code>. Think of the <code>BareSpec</code> as your input program, that has yet to be compiled: by this analogy, a <code>BareSpec</code> might still be ill-defined as it’s not yet being checked and verified by LH. Once a <code>BareSpec</code> gets verified by LH it becomes a <code>LiftedSpec</code>; the intuition behind the name is that the relevant Haskell types have been “lifted” into their <em>refined</em> counterparts.</p>
<p>Since <code>A.hs</code> imports some other modules, it has a number of <em>dependencies</em> that LH needs to track. The details are not important at this stage, as this dependency-tracking differs between the executable and the GHC Plugin, so let’s treat this process as a black box. The end result is a <code>HashSet</code> of <code>LiftedSpec</code>, where the use of <code>LiftedSpec</code> indicates that dependencies will have been verified (and lifted) by LH first.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the list of <em>Core bindings</em> for <code>A.hs</code>. Core is GHC’s internal representation, with an AST that is smaller and easier to work with than the full source Haskell AST. LH desugars the program into Core, transforms it into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-normal_form">A-normal form</a>, then traverses it to generate a set of refinement constraints that must be solved to “lift” a <code>BareSpec</code> into a <code>LiftedSpec</code>. The key takeaway is that LH needs access to the <strong>Core bindings of the input program in order to work</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, once we have everything we need, LH will apply a final transformation step to the input <code>{dependencies, coreBinds, bareSpec}</code>, producing two things as a result:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a <code>LiftedSpec</code>, which can now be serialised on disk and used as a dependency for other Haskell modules; and</li>
<li>a <code>TargetSpec</code>, which is the data structure LH uses to verify the soundness of <code>A.hs</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>After creating the <code>TargetSpec</code> LH has to solve what is, effectively, a constraints problem: it generates a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause">Horn Clauses</a> from the <code>TargetSpec</code> and feeds them into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories">SMT solver</a>.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> If a solution is found, our program is <code>SAFE</code>, otherwise it is <code>UNSAFE</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-old-status-quo">The old status quo</h3>
<p>Historically LH has been available only as a standalone executable, which had to be invoked on one or more target Haskell files in order to do its job. While this didn’t stop users from using it for <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10690-keynote-scrap-your-bounds-checks-with-liquid-haskell">real world applications</a>, it somewhat limited its adoption, despite packages such as <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/liquidhaskell-cabal">liquidhaskell-cabal</a> attempting to bridge the gap.</p>
<h5 id="compiling-haskell-code">Compiling Haskell code</h5>
<p>Now that we know how the kernel of LH works, understanding the executable and its limitations is not hard; in a nutshell, the executable used the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc">GHC API</a> to accomplish all sorts of tasks: from <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/blob/v8.6.5-final/src/Language/Haskell/Liquid/GHC/Interface.hs#L237">dependency analysis</a> down to <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/blob/v8.6.5-final/src/Language/Haskell/Liquid/GHC/Interface.hs#L389">parsing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/blob/v8.6.5-final/src/Language/Haskell/Liquid/GHC/Interface.hs#L391">typechecking</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/blob/v8.6.5-final/src/Language/Haskell/Liquid/GHC/Interface.hs#L467">desugaring</a> the input module. Astute readers might argue that <strong>this is replicating what GHC normally does</strong>, and they would be correct! One of the main shortcomings of the old executable was indeed that there was very little or no integration into GHC’s compilation pipeline.</p>
<h5 id="writing-and-distributing-specifications">Writing and distributing specifications</h5>
<p>As we have seen already, LH checks each and every refinement it can find while parsing an input Haskell module, which means that the more refinements we have, the more useful LH will be at spotting bugs and mistakes. However, this also means that <em>somehow</em> we need to have a way to <strong>write and distribute</strong> specifications for <em>existing</em> Haskell types, functions and even packages, as users would not like to be obliged to define refinements for basic things like <code>+</code> or natural numbers.</p>
<p>The LiquidHaskell HQ stoically solved this problem by shipping a “hardcoded” prelude as part of the executable, that contained specifications for some types in <code>base</code> and for some preeminent Haskell packages like <code>containers</code>, <code>bytestring</code> etc. While this worked, it wasn’t very <strong>flexible</strong>, as it was a “closed” environment: new specifications couldn’t be added without releasing a new version of LH, not to talk about tracking breaking changes to the relevant upstream packages. To say it differently, the hardcoded prelude made a best effort to be compatible with such Haskell packages, but it couldn’t guarantee that newer releases of, say, <code>bytestring</code>, wouldn’t break the specifications making LH compatible with <code>bytestring-x.x.x.x</code> but not <code>bytestring-x.x.y.y</code>.</p>
<h5 id="ide-support">IDE support</h5>
<p>With LH available as an executable, there was little hope to integrate it with things like <code>ghcide</code>, <code>ghcid</code> or even <code>ghci</code>. IDE support was added in an ad-hoc fashion by providing the executable with a <code>--json</code> flag that could be used to output the result of the refinement (including errors) in a JSON format. One could then write wrappers around it to turn such JSON into formats editors or LSP servers could understand. A notable mention goes here to Alan Zimmerman, who added a <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/blob/master/src/Haskell/Ide/Engine/Plugin/Liquid.hs">haskell-ide-engine plugin</a> for LH using the limited <code>--json</code> interface, nevertheless creating a very pleasant IDE experience.</p>
<h3 id="the-new-way">The new way</h3>
<p>Starting from version <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/liquidhaskell-0.8.10.1/docs/Language-Haskell-Liquid-GHC-Plugin-Tutorial.html">0.8.10.1</a>, LH is available as a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-8.10.1/docs/Plugins.html">GHC Plugin</a>, which means that integrating it into your project is as easy as adding an extra <code>-fplugin=LiquidHaskell</code> to the list of <code>ghc-options</code> in your <code>.cabal</code> file, and adding <code>liquidhaskell</code> and <code>liquid-base</code> to its dependencies. In the rest of this post we will discuss the design of this plugin, as it ended up being outside the conventional boundaries of what it can be defined a “standard” plugin, for reasons which will become obvious later on.</p>
<h3 id="a-ghc-plugin-quick-recap">A GHC Plugin quick recap</h3>
<p>Before discussing the plugin’s design, let’s quickly recap how a GHC Plugin works, starting, as always, from a picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/alfredo/lh-as-a-ghc-plugin/plugin_architecture.png"></p>
<p>At its core, a Plugin is simply a Haskell data record where record fields expose customisable actions that can modify most of GHC’s pipeline stages. Let’s take for example <code>parsedResultAction</code>:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>parsedResultAction ::</span> [<span>CommandLineOption</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ModSummary</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HsParsedModule</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Hsc</span> <span>HsParsedModule</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The documentation states that it will “Modify the module when it is parsed. This is called by HscMain when the parsing is successful.”. This means that we can write a simple Haskell function that takes as input a <code>HsParsedModule</code> and it has to produce a <em>new</em> <code>HsParsedModule</code>, effectively allowing us to modify how the GHC pipeline behaves. Similarly, <code>typecheckResultAction</code> is called after typechecking has ended, while <code>installCoreToDos</code> allows us to add extra optimizations and transformations on the Core representation of the program. This is for example how <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/inspection-testing">inspection-testing</a> performs its magic, by grabbing the Core bindings at this stage.</p>
<h3 id="the-general-design-idea">The general design idea</h3>
<p>There is a <em>fil rouge</em> in all the different iterations of the plugin, namely the idea that a <code>LiftedSpec</code> should be serialised into the <strong>interface file</strong> of the associated …</p></div></div></div>

            <p>With QFlow.ai coming out of beta, I wanted to share a bit about what QFlow.ai is and does, but also try to answer the question: why build QFlow.ai?</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the problem. Both I and my co-founder have spent years in executive
positions (CFO, VP Finance, VP Operations, VP Marketing, etc.) at B2B companies. At each company, between sales,
marketing, customer success, and finance, <strong>we had a lot of tools generating a lot of data</strong>. But our organizations were by and large
stuck with outdated tools and skills to analyze that data.</p>

<li><a href="#different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates plans?</a></li>
<li><a href="#what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s next?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/DataSources.gif" alt="Lots of data, not much information"></p>
<h2 id="deceivingly-simple-but-important-questions-are-notoriously-difficult-to-answer-for-b2b-sales--marketing-professionals">Deceivingly simple but important questions are notoriously difficult to answer for B2B sales &amp; marketing professionals</h2>
<p>Often the simplest of questions that we ask of our data are difficult to answer reliably,
accurately, and efficiently. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the customer acquisition journey look like, from marketing, to sales, to customer success?</li>
<li>What programs, marketing campaigns, and sales tools are yielding the best outcomes? What about relative to cost?</li>
<li>How much time is it taking for our sales reps to follow up on an inbound lead?</li>
<li>What happened to the opportunities that made up the $XX million dollars in last month’s sales forecast?</li>
<li>What types of outbound sales activities are yielding productive vs. unproductive outcomes? Which sales behaviors can we model our playbook around?</li>
<li>How can we more accurately predict conversions? How can we more accurately forecast renewals?</li>
<li>Can we fix lead scoring and build trust between sales and marketing?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-properly-analyze-a-b2b-business-a-data-warehouse-is-required-but-alone-is-insufficient">To properly analyze a B2B business, a data warehouse is required but alone is insufficient</h2>
<p>Addressing these questions with intellectual honesty turned out to be a slippery slope.
If we got engineering to stand up a data warehouse, we would then require a data engineering resource. If we got a data engineering resource, we
would then have to compete for her/his time and attention with more interesting projects.</p>
<p>And, even if we successfully had convinced a capable data engineer to help us maintain the data warehouse, that was just the
beginning. <strong>We would <em>still</em> need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy lifting in terms of data transformation, far beyond the capabilities of SQL</li>
<li>to overcome disagreements / the lack of belief in marketing attribution models</li>
<li>to get stakeholders onboard across sales, marketing, finance, customer success, etc.</li>
<li>analysts to partner with data engineers, <strong>so we could derive <em>useful information</em> from the data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we had data, but found that too often it resulted in little useful information. Managing our business meant we needed to <strong>discard
“intuition” and embrace complex data</strong>, which in turn meant upgrading our organization’s tool set and skill set.
This simply wasn’t feasible most of the time.</p>
<p>So we built QFlow.ai. Because B2B customer-facing teams deserve to use a modern data toolset and its benefits.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-qflow-ai">What is QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>QFlow.ai is a platform that enables B2B businesses to adopt machine learning, embrace complexity, and quickly answer the
questions that matter most. It works not by generating more data, but by using the <strong>data that you already have from</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salesforce.com (standard objects)</li>
<li>Your marketing automation platform (Marketo, Hubspot, Pardot, etc.)</li>
<li>Commonly used marketing platforms (e.g., Google Ads)</li>
<li>Optionally, any custom data that would be relevant to a machine learning model (more on that later)</li>
</ul>
<p>We built QFlow.ai specifically to capture the data needed to engineer a time series based dataset, with
an abstraction layer that sits on top and addresses idiosyncratic implementations of Salesforce.com.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with idiosyncratic business systems implementation, you might understandably have raised an eyebrow just now.</p>
<p>With the understanding each company is different, we built an account setup process that addresses differences in and
builds on  similarities in implementations. It works so well
that we’ve patented it.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/qflow-ai-setup-wizard.png" alt="Simple setup abstracts away complexity"></p>
<p>Rather than spending days, weeks, or months setting up marketing attribution, our beta customers start getting value out of
QFlow.ai over the course of an early afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-qflowai-work">How does QFlow.ai work?</h2>
<p>Let’s address how QFlow.ai works at a high level.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, QFlow.ai creates a secure data warehouse for you and you alone — into which it pulls your corporate data</li>
<li>It uses existing data in your CRM and marketing platform to generate data visualizations and power machine learning recipes (more on that later)</li>
<li>It then re-assembles standard and, optionally, custom data to a format amenable to machine learning</li>
<li>And it works out of the box, requiring mere minutes of configuration — not days or months of setup / professional services
<img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/QFlow-Platform-Overview-Aug-2020.png" alt="QFlow Platform Basics"></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-qflow-ai-do">What are the capabilities of QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>As of August 2020, the Standard Plan QFlow.ai includes the following major features:</p>

<h2 id="different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates QFlow.ai Standard from QFlow Pro? (Machine Learning Recipes)</h2>
<p>Originally, we planned on much more differentiation. But at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made a decision to shove as much functionality as
possible into the QFlow.ai standard plan at a very low-friction price  ($699/mo paid annually, $899/mo paid monthly).</p>
<p>The primary difference between the two plans today is that <a href="https://qflow.ai/products/machine-learning">Machine Learning Recipes</a>
are available in Pro. This is not “machine learning” in a box. Instead, we’ve developed templates for machine learning
models that address common use cases in B2B. These templates are building blocks that, when deployed, are trained
and tuned machine learning models. <strong>We call these pre-built templates Machine Learning (ML) Recipes.</strong></p>
<p>Our two most popular Machine Learning recipes address <strong>lead scoring</strong> and <strong>opportunity scoring</strong>.</p>
<p>A typical Machine Learning recipe relies on standard information gleaned from your Salesforce.com and marketing platform integration,
but all recipes in our library can ingest <strong>custom data</strong> (e.g., product usage data, # API calls, seat utilization).</p>
<p>The inferred results from your ML jobs are available both on the QFlow.ai platform
and in your Salesforce.com instance. This way, your employees are able to orient their workday more intelligently without disruption.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s on the roadmap for QFlow.ai</h2>
<p>We have built a lot in 9 short months, but there remains a lot to build. If you are a capable data scientist, devops

<p>The SEC announced on Wednesday that they are <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-191">modernizing the accredited investor definition</a>. They’ve added an exception to the income/net-worth rule for investors with professional knowledge and experience. This is good news!</p>



<h2>Traditional hedge fund offerings</h2>



<p>Hedge funds typically raise money through Reg D, 506(b), which directs offers to invest only to accredited investors. Accredited investors include individuals with a net worth of at least $1 million, not including the value of their primary residence. Also included are individuals with an annual income of at least $200k ($300k if combined with spouse) for the prior two years and with a reasonable expectation of the same or greater income in the current year. Hedge funds marketing to such individuals might ask for past tax forms, or have a third party (CPA or attorney) represent that the investor is accredited.</p>



<p>Now with this change, the scope of accreditation is being expanded to sophisticated individual investors who understand the law and the investment risks involved. Concretely, now included are holders in good standing of the Series 7, Series 65, and Series 82 licenses. Additional certifications, designations, or credentials may be added in the future.</p>



<h2>This may help small hedge funds</h2>



<p>This change will not make a difference for large hedge funds. They are not marketing to people with low net worth, regardless of sophistication. In fact, to the extent they target individuals at all, most hedge funds actually raise money only from <em>qualified purchasers</em>, who have at least $5 million in investments. And the minimum investment amount can be very high. Here are some examples from hedge fund offerings reported on <a href="https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/form-d">SEC Form D for 2020 Q2</a>:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Fund offering</th><th>Minimum investment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Newport Patriot LLC</td><td>$325,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Winton Rio Grande Fund LP</td><td>$200,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Atlas Institutional Equity Fund, L.P.</td><td>$150,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>ERS Launchpad, LLC</td><td>$150,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Morris Island Partners, L.P.</td><td>$100,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>CMAP SRPA Fund Ltd</td><td>$50,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>CC ARB West, LLC</td><td>$50,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Blue Isles Futures Fund Ltd.</td><td>$40,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>ABRAMS BISON PARTNERS, LP</td><td>$25,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Darsana Fund LP</td><td>$20,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Four Pines Onshore Fund LP</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Squarepoint Core International Feeder Ltd</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Verdad Opportunity Fund I, LP</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Think India Opportunities Fund LP</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Orion Commodities Delaware Fund LP</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So, as far as hedge funds are concerned, this change is only interesting to low-capacity funds that would consider taking small investments.</p>



<h2>Series 7</h2>



<p>The Series 7 exam is for broker-dealers. It has a prerequisite – the Securities Industry Essentials exam. Also, you must be sponsored by a member firm to take the exam. Here is an example question:</p>



<blockquote><p>Convertible bonds have all of the following features except:<br>    A. an ability to protect a short position on the stock into which they are convertible<br>    B. permissibility for use as collateral<br>    C. a normally higher yield than non-convertible bonds of the same issuer<br>    D. fluctuations influenced by changes in the price of the underlying common stock</p></blockquote>



<h2>Series 82</h2>



<p>The Series 82 exam is for conducting private securities offerings. It has the same Securities Industry Essentials exam prerequisite and sponsoring requirement. Here is an example question:</p>



<blockquote><p>When must checks to purchase securities in a contingency offering be delivered to the escrow agent?<br>    A. By noon the next business day<br>    B. Immediately<br>    C. Within 2 business days<br>    D. Within 3 business days</p></blockquote>



<h2>Series 65</h2>



<p>The Series 65 exam is for becoming an investment advisor. One does <em>not</em> need to be sponsored to take this exam. Here is an example question:</p>



<blockquote><p>XYA a manufacturer of computer circuit boards has $50,000,000 worth of subordinated debentures outstanding. Each debenture carries an interest rate of 6.5% and has warrants attached to the debenture to purchase 5 shares of XYA at $25 per share. XYA’s stock is trading in the market place at $28 per share and the warrants are about to expire. How many new shares can XYA reasonably expect to issue?<br>    A. 50,000<br>    B. 250,000<br>    C. 500,000<br>    D. 25,000</p></blockquote>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As my intention is to start a small hedge fund, this change to the definition of accreditation can only help. Also, since I intend to take the Series 65 exam anyway, this will give me the added benefit of (myself) being an accredited investor no matter what income fluctuations come in the next few years without a job.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to sort a list in Python, by following the below three steps:</p> <ol><li>Options to sort a list in Python<ul><li>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</li><li>An example of using “sort”</li><li>An example of using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>How to Sort a List in Reverse<ul><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sort”</li><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>Sort with a Custom Function using Key</li></ol> <h2>1. Options to sort a list in Python</h2> <p>There exist two main options, those are <code>sort()</code> and <code>sorted()</code>, let’s explore them below.</p> <h3>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</h3> <p><code>list.sort()</code> changes the list in place and returns <code>None</code>.</p> <p><code>sorted()</code> takes an iterable and returns a new list, sorted.</p> <h3>An example of using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort()

# print the new list
print(new_list)
# result: None

print(our_list)
# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how it changes the list itself, but does not return a value to be placed into a new variable.</p> <h3>An example of using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how the changes are saved to the new list/variable.</p> <h2>2. How to Sort a List in Reverse</h2> <p>Using the above functions, it’s simple to sort a list in reverse. Just specify the <code>reverse</code> argument and set it to <code>True</code>.</p> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort(reverse=True)

print(our_list)
# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list, reverse=True)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h2>3. Sort with a Custom Function using Key</h2> <p>It is also possible to implement your own sorting method. This is done by adding a <code>key</code> parameter and setting it to a method.</p>  <p>For example:</p> <pre title=""># create a list of different length items
our_list = ["fasd", "asstt", "cqasf", "zqfwsef", "ba"]

# sort the list, by `len`
new_list = sorted(our_list, key=len)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['ba', 'fasd', 'asstt', 'cqasf', 'zqfwsef']
</pre> <p>Just as we used <code>sorted</code> here, you could also have used <code>list.sort</code> as follows:</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len)
</pre> <p>As before, you can also combine the <code>reverse=True</code> argument should you want the reverse order.</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len, reverse=True)

# or

sorted(our_list, key=len, reverse=True)
</pre> <p>You could also swap out the use of the <code>len</code> method as the custom <code>key</code> with your own function, or lambda, to sort by some custom choice.</p> <p>For example:</p>  <pre title="">student_tuples = [('john', 'A', 15),('jane', 'B', 12),('dave', 'B', 10),]
sorted(student_tuples, key=lambda student: student[2]) 

# result: [('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
</pre> <p>Or in another example:</p> <pre title="">lst = [('candy','30','100'), ('apple','10','200'), ('baby','20','300')]
lst.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
print(lst)

# result: [('apple', '10', '200'), ('baby', '20', '300'), ('candy', '30', '100')]
</pre>  </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent"><p><img alt="Pull doughnuts" src="https://www.grouparoo.com/_next/static/images/doughnuts-90d02f03fc3e2d5704ed88886a47f9df.jpg"></p><p>There’s an underlying pattern prevalent today in many digital marketing tools that is causing problems. Wasted time, overpaying, slow velocity, and privacy issues for your customers are some of the results of this pattern. The problem is the over-reliance on Events. Specifically, the problem is that many marketing tools live in a world where they expect to be “pushed” data, when it would be so much better if they were “pulling” data when they needed it.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll explore the problems with event-based “Push” marketing &amp; analytics tools, and how we can fix them by switching to a “Pull” based solution, like the one that <a href="https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo">Grouparoo</a> is building.</p><h2>The Problems with “Push” and Events</h2><p>We have conducted interviews with over 70 marketing teams of all sizes throughout the world. What follows is a synthesis of some of the common problems they face with their current marketing tools.</p><h3>Overpaying</h3><p>One of the most telling critiques of event-based SaaS marketing tools is the fact that marketing teams are /actively/ pruning the events they are sending to control costs. Tools like Segment work best when you can build a robust profile of your customers' activity, but Segment charges you more when you store more data! Segment essentially holds their functionality hostage as you gain more users who in turn produce more events. Countless marketers lamented pain of having to decide which events to keep tracking versus which to stop tracking. Inevitably, a new campaign idea would hit them a few months later that would need the event that they stopped tracking. These teams and marketers just didn’t have the money to keep sending every event. This takes us to the Stale Data problem.</p><h3>Stale Data</h3><p>When using only events to model your customers, there’s a huge lag time between when you start capturing that data and when you can use it. For example, say you want to run a campaign targeting customers who haven’t purchased in 6 months. If you start sending <code>purchase</code> events in June, the soonest you can start your campaign is December. Not only is that a long time to wait, but you’ve also sacrificed your team’s agility to modify those events or the campaign while you wait, <a href="https://www.grouparoo.com/blog/the-shots-you-get-to-take">minimizing the shots you get to take</a>.</p><h3>Lost History</h3><p>In addition to the slow ramp up time for a new campaign based on events, there’s the problem of lost events. With poor mobile connections, errors on your web pages &amp; apps, slow vendors, and increasingly prevalent ad-blocking tools, it’s very easy to lose an event. Every marketer we talked to had their own less-than-scientific process they used to explain discrepancies between events and product data. Everyone had a different process and no one really trusted an event-based data source. If events are the only way you model your customers, it can be devastating if you miss a <code>changed-email-address</code> event - you might never be able to reach your customers at all!</p><p>Coupling this issue with the Stale Data problem, there’s no way to fully model customers you had before you started sending events. There’s no way to compare the profile you’ve built in Segment against your product database, where the customer’s data is actually stored with confidence.</p><h3>Privacy Nightmare</h3><p>Finally, there’s a challenging privacy story regarding events. You have a relationship with your customers and part of that relationship is based on trust. How sure are you that Segment or Mixpanel is storing your customers' data safely? How many other services do your events pass though on the way to them? Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager? AdMob? Facebook or Twitter Pixels? The list goes on and on. Any one of these vendors is a potential vector for attack, event theft, or event manipulation.</p><p>With regulations like GDPR and CCPA and many more on the way, you have a clear legal responsibility to keep your customers' data safe. Part of that responsibility is ensuring that the companies you share data with will update, delete, and anonymize data when <em>you</em> ask them too. What’s your process for doing that for all of your past events?</p><h2>The future is "Pull"</h2><p>How would you build things if you were starting today? We would focus on pulling in data from our existing sources, of course!</p><p>Now, imagine you were starting to build a new marketing tool from scratch, like <a href="https://www.grouparoo.com/">Grouparoo</a> is. You aren’t burdened by the poor legacy choices of Segment, Mixpanel, and the rest. How would you build things if you were starting today? We would focus on pulling in data from our existing data sources. With Grouparoo, events are a way to augment your customer profiles, not the main source of critical data.</p><p>Grouparoo’s goal is to make it easy for non-technical members of your team to build robust customer profiles and groups. Then, they can synchronize that data in a safe way to communication and advertising partners. A highly-functioning digital marketing team can quickly add new profile properties, augment them with data from your product and data warehouse(s), and start running a new campaign in minutes, rather than weeks.</p><h3>Within your Firewall</h3><p>To be in the best position to pull in data, the Grouparoo application should be located within your company firewall. This means that Grouparoo should run on <em>your</em> servers and have (read) access to your databases. In this way, no data ever leaves your company’s control, and you can always inspect, audit, and change it. You don’t need to send your customer data over the open internet to a third party just to build a new cohort.</p><h3>Safe and Secure</h3><p>Since your customer data lives where it belongs on your servers, you can make changes and deletions as needed, and you can prove it. You can build a transparent GDPR/CCPA process at your company with Grouparoo. Grouparoo has robust access controls and logs to ensure that every profile and group is managed the way it should be.</p><h3>Cost Controls</h3><p>Since Grouparoo is running on your servers, there’s no additional cost to import more data. If you want to add more properties to your customer profiles to build more fine-grained groups and cohorts, then do it! Have you imported a facet you no longer need? Delete it! Grouparoo doesn't charge per event, or any other measure of data quantity, so you are free to experiment at will.</p><h3>Always up-to-date</h3><p>The “Pull” pattern has a wonderful property; Grouparoo can check up on the data whenever we are about to use it! This means that rather than waiting for an event to (possibly) be sent to Grouparoo to update a customer’s preferences or LTV, we can ask the primary source. Grouparoo will always re-import the properties of every profile before sending a communication to the customer, or syncing with a third party. This means that you can be sure that you’ll always be working with the latest customer preferences, purchase, email address, names, etc. when communicating with them. No lost events will prevent you from communicating effectively.</p><h3>Ready for ad-blocking technology by respecting consumer choices</h3><p>Finally, the pattern of tracking and sending <strong>so many</strong> events from our sites and applications is leading to more and more consumers blocking tools like Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Google Analytics from getting any events at all. In fact, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking">major browsers are now shipping with defaults to prevent third-party tracking and cookies</a>. Rather than fight the modern privacy-conscious consumer because your marketing stack relies on events, embrace the choices they are making. Utilize your source-of-truth of their behavior and preferences you already have, your product database.</p><h2>Grouparoo’s Open-Source Promise</h2><p>There’s still a place for events in your marketing stack, but they shouldn’t be the primary source of any piece of customer data. Grouparoo’s goal is to embrace the “Pull” data model as much as we can, and this means making it as easy as possible for you to install and run it within your cloud.

Often, these algorithms are solutions that have stumbled upon some good problems to solve. Unfortunately, the problems are evolving. And I don’t think these solutions are going to remain relevant much longer. Let’s start with defining the problems they solve:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Distributed Durability:</strong> In case of node failures, your data is guaranteed to be elsewhere.</li><li><strong>Availability:</strong> The ability for the system to continue serving if some nodes have become unavailable.</li><li><strong>Automation:</strong> If there is a failure, the system knows how to remedy itself without human intervention.</li></ul><figure id="w-node-d4ab4f4234b1-ca993012"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ef5a4d4da0d67ccda9b5588/5f497703db3131567e9cf57c_consensus-02.png" loading="lazy" alt="Consensus Algorithms at Scale"></p><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>Strictly speaking, one could argue that Automation is a different theoretical problem because it requires failure detection. But the reality is that today’s systems expect consensus systems to satisfy the above properties.<br></p><p>Let us now turn this around: If we had started out with these requirements, would we have ended up with something like Paxos or Raft as the best solution? Before we can answer this question, we need a better understanding of the requirements.<br></p><p>More importantly, cloud providers are coming up with complex topologies like zones and regions. They have pricing structures that encourage specific configurations. It is important that the systems we build are capable of adapting to these nuances. It is only a matter of time before these rigid algorithms start to run out of flexibility.<br></p><p>The spoiler here is that we are building this type of flexibility in Vitess: You specify what is important to you, and what (reasonable) trade-offs you are willing to make. And Vitess will have the knobs to exactly match these parameters without compromising on anything else.<br></p><p>However, we need to satisfy the skeptic’s concern: can you build such a system using vanilla MySQL? The short answer is yes.<br>‍<br></p><h4><strong>The Approach</strong></h4><p>In this series of blog posts, I’ll take you through a journey where we will dissect consensus algorithms. We’ll break them up into smaller concerns, and we’ll build a new set of rules and principles using a variety of more flexible algorithms which can be built. We will conclude with how to achieve these objectives in Vitess.<br></p><p>As a disclaimer, this is an engineering approach. So, if you are expecting proof, you’ll likely be disappointed. I will instead be using and sharing intuitions developed from running storage systems at massive scale. Consequently, we will make two changes to how we approach this problem:</p><ol role="list"><li>Use engineering terminology. This is more for my own sake, because it is hard to reason about how an academic concept maps to real-world scenarios.</li><li>Use an approach based on objectives to be achieved: approaching the problem top-down, identifying the concerns, and keeping them separate.<br></li></ol><p>The second aspect is significant because most consensus algorithms perform orchestrated actions that achieve multiple objectives at the same time. It is hard to know why a decision was made a certain way and what the trade-offs are if a different approach was used.<br></p><p>With a better understanding of&nbsp; the concerns, we can make better trade-offs without being stuck with rigid implementations.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p id="6cad">Let’s take a closer look at the technical aspects of this technology (Global Positioning Systems), starting with the satellites and working our way down to the receivers on the ground.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*rBAMjm_JHGi1SBqs8vgu5g.png?resize=586%2C350&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="586" height="350" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*rBAMjm_JHGi1SBqs8vgu5g.png?resize=586%2C350&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>NavStar GPS satellite</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="2fbd">Background Info</h2>



<p id="2901">The&nbsp;<strong>Global Positioning System (GPS)</strong>, originally known as&nbsp;<strong>NavStar</strong>, was created by the US military back in 1995. NavStar was originally a collection of over two dozen GPS satellites in geosynchronous orbit.</p>



<p id="b621">Nowadays, NavStar has grown to a network of over 30 satellites orbiting the Earth approximately 13,000 miles above the surface. These satellites make two passes over the same spot every day as they move in their west to east orbit.</p>



<p id="a1d9">While other countries are developing their own GPS satellite networks, the US NavStar system is still the standard.</p>



<p id="ab50">Only 24 satellites are needed to provide line of sight coverage to 95% of Earth’s surface. The remaining function primarily as backup and are queried only when more accuracy is needed.</p>



<h2 id="b2ef">Satellites</h2>



<p id="491c">The most critical component on board these satellites is the&nbsp;<strong>atomic clock</strong>. As you’ll soon see, reliable timekeeping is the single most important function of these satellites.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1500/1*dZQbtHhY_4vNde3GlVOYLg.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1500/1*dZQbtHhY_4vNde3GlVOYLg.jpeg?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>This atomic clock was built for the first GPS satellites in the late 1970s.</figcaption></figure>



<blockquote><p>“Atomic clocks are designed to measure the precise length of a second, the base unit of modern timekeeping. The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the time it takes a caesium-133 atom in a precisely defined state to oscillate exactly: 9 billion, 192 million, 631 thousand, 770 times.”</p><p>— Live Science</p></blockquote>



<p id="fb6e"><strong>GPS Payload</strong></p>



<p id="2528">GPS is inherently a passive system. The GPS satellites do not receive any information.</p>



<p id="ed4f">Instead, each satellite reports at regular intervals:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Pseudo Random Code</strong>&nbsp;— an identification value for the satellite (used by the receiver to decode the signal)</li><li><strong>Almanac Data&nbsp;</strong>— the position of the satellite at any given moment in time and orbital information about all other active satellites (this informs the receiver about which satellites should be available and at what time -helping the receiver to more quickly acquire a GPS fix)</li><li><strong>Ephemeris Data</strong>&nbsp;— more specific information about the satellite: it’s current date, time, health, and location. This data is broadcasted approximately every 30 seconds by NavStar satellites. Ephemeris data is usually updated every 2 hours and is valid for 4 hours.</li></ol>



<h2 id="51d9">From A Cold Start</h2>



<p id="66be">Despite the frequency of the broadcast, the almanac alone is generally not accurate enough for a GPS receiver to get a location fix — especially if the GPS receiver is launching from a cold start.</p>



<p id="aec2">More often that not, the cached almanac information of the GPS receiver will be out of date, so some receivers — especially older ones — may have to wait upwards of 10 minutes to receive a full almanac and ephemeris data broadcast from each satellite before they can provide a GPS fix.</p>



<p id="064f">Additionally, ephemeris data has a natural expiry as it can’t be cached for too long due to clock drift. Waiting for the broadcast and reception of updated ephemeris data is the main cause for the long start time of GPS receivers.</p>



<h4 id="3be9"><strong>A-GPS</strong></h4>



<p id="1491">Luckily most modern devices, like today’s smartphones, are able to minimize this wait time. Most modern mobile devices use a variant of traditional GPS technology called A-GPS ( Assisted Global Positioning System) that helps them acquire a GPS fix quickly.</p>



<p id="07cf">A-GPS works by leveraging the phone’s data connection to contact an assistance server. The server will provide the almanac and ephemeris data directly, so the phone no longer needs to wait for the transmission from the satellite. However, once you are out of cell coverage, the phone would then revert back to the onboard GPS unit and will need several minutes to acquire the ephemeris and almanac data in the traditional manner.</p>



<h4 id="a00a"><strong>GPS Signal</strong></h4>



<p id="aa56">Most GPS transmissions are in the UHF portion of the frequency spectrum. Most civilian GPS communication is done on&nbsp;<strong>1575.42&nbsp;<em>MHz</em>&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;<em>1227.60 MHz</em></strong>.</p>



<p id="1531">Additionally, GPS signal uses CDMA spread-spectrum techniques in order to allow all satellites to transmit on the same frequency without interfering with one another.</p>



<h4 id="aae1"><strong>GPS Transmission</strong></h4>



<p id="52c8">According to RadioElectronics, standard GPS transmission is roughly 15000 bits in length and is transmitted at a rate of 50 bits / second — taking about 30 seconds to complete the transmission.</p>



<p id="9c18">The frame is split up into 5 sub-frames each 300 bits in length with a transmission time of 6 seconds.</p>



<p id="b0d2">The frames help the receiver identify the start and end of the transmission so they can easily synchronize with the incoming signals and decode the transmission.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Sub-Frame 1:&nbsp;</strong>Clock, GPS Time, Health of Satellite, Satellite ID</p><p><strong>Sub-Frame 2–3:</strong>&nbsp;Ephemeris Data</p><p><strong>Sub-Frame 4–5:</strong>&nbsp;Almanac Data</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="c16d">Receiver</h2>



<h4 id="950a">Trilateration</h4>



<p id="9d46">GPS, on the receiver side, works by using an approach called&nbsp;<strong>trilateration</strong>.</p>



<p id="2646">Imagine I told you I was 150 miles from Los Angeles, 200 miles from Las Vegas, and 75 miles from your Fresno.</p>



<p id="83f1">With just those 3 distance values, you would be able to determine a region that matches these constraints and would be able to estimate my current location within that region. The more distance measurements you have, the more accurate your estimate of my location becomes.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/526/1*PZaGjJw3W-TQl3DmkpahjA.png?resize=578%2C558&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="578" height="558" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/526/1*PZaGjJw3W-TQl3DmkpahjA.png?resize=578%2C558&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Trilateration Example</figcaption></figure></div>



<p id="c6d2">GPS requires at minimum distances to 3 satellite in order to get a fix on your location. As we already known, GPS signals include the location of the satellite and the time according to the satellite’s internal clock. If we measure the time that we receive the message and compare the difference in time to the time the message was sent from the satellite, we can figure out how long the message was in transit. Additionally, knowing that all of these signals are sent at the speed of light, we can multiply these two values together to compute your straight line distance to a particular satellite.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/proxy/0*HY7l7PcoJBE_eqXK.jpg?resize=582%2C422&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="582" height="422" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/proxy/0*HY7l7PcoJBE_eqXK.jpg?resize=582%2C422&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="b6c2">Satellites use expensive atomic clocks for this very reason. The more accurate the time value transmitted, the more accurate the receiver can be about it’s distance to the satellite.</p>



<p id="7cc7">Though we can figure out a user’s 2D location using just 3 satellites, using a 4th satellite allows us to compute an altitude value. While a 2D location fix might work for some cases as GPS would assume you’re near sea level, if you were on a mountain, a 2D fix could have an error of several hundred meters.</p>



<p id="5d42">Furthermore, because receivers — like a mobile phone — often have cheaper less accurate clocks — we need to account for the timing error introduced by the cheaper hardware and other environmental factors (decreases in the signal’s speed caused by the ionosphere and the troposphere). Using a 4th satellite will not only provide an altitude value, but it will allow us to solve a system of equations that let’s us identify the clock error and compute a more accurate position.</p>



<p id="30e2">Most modern GPS receivers will use this additional information to try and synchronize their internal clock with the satellite’s atomic clock.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*VV60PICUN4Xnwt6tphqNDQ.png?resize=579%2C297&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="579" height="297" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*VV60PICUN4Xnwt6tphqNDQ.png?resize=579%2C297&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="44af">That’s why most modern GPS receivers will typically track all available line of sight satellites, but only use some subset for the actual calculation.</p>



<p id="4221">Now that the GPS receiver’s antenna can pick up at least 4 satellites, it can accurately calculate it’s position and time in 3 dimensions (latitude, longitude, and altitude).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
		
<p>If you’re like me, you’ve wondered how sites like Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram are able to tell you whether a username has been taken so quickly. It seemed like these services were able to search through hundreds of millions of user records to verify the uniqueness of a prospective username in no time at all.</p>



<p>After some research, I came across the data structure that is responsible for this speed – a probabilistic data structure called the bloom filter.</p>



<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>Bloom filters share some similarities with traditional sets. Generally speaking, a set will tell you with certainty whether it contains a particular element or not. Bloom filters, however, make a slightly different promise. </p>



<p>They are probabilistic data structures which means they’ll tell you with certainty whether an element is <em><strong>not</strong></em> in the set and they’ll tell you if it is <em><strong>probably</strong></em> in the set. In other words, there’s a chance that bloom filters will return a false positive. That is, they’ll incorrectly claim that the set contains an element that was never added.</p>



<p>Maybe you’re wondering why a data structure that can only probably tell you if it contains an element is useful? Well, bloom filters are extremely fast and memory-efficient as we’ll soon see. Sometimes the speed and scalability of a solution are more important than the occasional false positives. In practice, if you know what your acceptable false positive rate is, you can calculate an initial size for the bloom filter to guarantee that rate.</p>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>Bloom filters are simply a bit array of <em><code>m</code> </em>bits all initially set to 0. We’ll also need <em><code>k</code></em> different hash functions. These functions will be run over whatever item we are trying to add to the set and will return the indices in the bloom filter to turn from a 0 to a 1.</p>



<p>It’s important that whatever hash functions we choose create a uniform random distribution for best results. There are many industry standard options to pick from: HashMix, murmur, and the fnv series – just to name a few. </p>



<p>Generally, the number of hash functions needed would be a small constant derived from whatever false positive rate is acceptable for your use case. </p>



<h2>Initialization</h2>



<p>Let’s take an empty bloom filter and add an element to it.</p>



<p><code>let size = 10</code></p>



<p><code>let bloomFilter = Array(repeating: false, count: size)&nbsp;</code></p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Adding an element</h2>



<p>To add an element, we’ll take the element we want to add and pass it to all <code><em>k</em></code> hash functions to get <code><em>k</em></code> array indices. We’ll set the value at those indices to 1.</p>



<blockquote><p>In practice, these would not be 3 distinct hashing algorithms. Instead, it’d likely be the same algorithm just seeded with a different value (i.e. <em>1 … k</em>) which will generate <em>k</em> distinct hash functions.</p></blockquote>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm1(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm2(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm3(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>







<p>Now, it might look something like this:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>And after adding a few more entries to the set:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Querying</h2>



<p>If we wanted to query for an element, we’d do the same operations to get the k array indices. Then, if any of the bits at those indices are 0, we know definitively that the value is not in the set. Instead, if all of the indices values are 1, we know that the value is probably<em> </em>in the set – remember it could still be a false positive.&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>bloomFilter.search(“digital”)</code> which in turn calls:</p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm1(“digital”) % size] // 2</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm2(“digital”) % size] // 6</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm3(“digital”) % size] // 7</code></p>



<p>So, to check if the element is in the set, we just need to check indices 2,6, and 7 and verify they are set to 1.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center"><span><strong>1</strong></span></td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center"><strong>1</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>1</strong></td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So, now we know that “digital” is probably in the set.</p>



<h2>Limitations</h2>



<p>It’s important to understand that elements can only be added to bloom filters and never removed. We can’t reset particular bits back to 0 because we don’t know if there’s some other element in the set that also maps to those indices. For example, after passing through the hash functions, “dog” and “cat” might share the exact same indices. </p>



<p>Remember the filter isn’t storing the data anywhere unlike traditional sets, arrays, etc, it’s just turning on certain indices.&nbsp;So, there’s no way of checking what word a particular set of indices relates to. </p>



<h2>Big O</h2>



<p>Implementing bloom filters requires us to specify the size upfront, so we can’t enlarge the data structure later. As a result, the more elements we add to the filter, the higher the error rate rises. So, it’s important to choose an initial size for the bloom filter that can scale with your data and allows you to keep a maintainable error rate.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>add(): O(k)<code>&nbsp;</code></p><p>contains(): O(k)</p><p>where k is the number of hash functions. </p></blockquote>



<p>One of the key advantages of bloom filters is that the time to add or check for inclusion in the set is constant; it’s completely independent of the number of items in the set.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Bloom filters are used everywhere. Chances are in just getting to this site you’ve encountered one. Chrome uses a local Bloom filter to store malicious URLs. Before navigating to a site, the browser will check if the site exists in the set of malicious URLs and if it does it’ll perform a full check on Google’s servers.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="fa89">This week’s edition — edge detection in images. More specifically we’ll be taking a closer look at the Sobel Edge Detection algorithm.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1270/1*3hDhkzqJStXTp37lS_M5aA.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1270/1*3hDhkzqJStXTp37lS_M5aA.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="3f05">Let’s start from the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="77be">Grayscale Images</h2>



<p id="7b79">The Sobel algorithm works by measuring the varying pixel intensity in an image. Naturally, this is easiest to accomplish when the image is a standardized grayscale image.</p>



<p id="f1c5">There are several algorithms to generate grayscale images — the simplest being an average of the R,G, and B values in a pixel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/109/1*A-ZtS4G-IVhhDb4qboYYWQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/109/1*A-ZtS4G-IVhhDb4qboYYWQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="53f5">Then, we re-assign these new intensity values to the R,G, and B fields of the original pixel. Any situation where all the R,G, and B values are the same will give you a shade of gray (remember&nbsp;<em>#00000</em>&nbsp;is black and #<em>FFFFFF</em>&nbsp;is white).</p>



<p id="105e">However, though this often gives good results, the following grayscale function uses a weighted average that is better aligned with how the human eye interprets different colors and the transition between them.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/227/1*llWVqAtpyl65W0V7lqQjUA.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/227/1*llWVqAtpyl65W0V7lqQjUA.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="bd35">Regardless of which formula we use, we now have a grayscale image that we can apply the Sobel Edge Detection algorithm too.</p>



<h2 id="ae13">Sobel Detection Algorithm</h2>



<p id="d390">The Sobel algorithm was developed by Irwin Sobel and Gary Feldman at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) in 1968.</p>



<p id="b93f">In the simplest terms, their algorithm works by running a 3×3 matrix&nbsp;<em>(</em>known as the&nbsp;<em>kernel)&nbsp;</em>over all the pixels in the image. At every iteration, we measure the change in the gradient of the pixels that fall within this 3×3 kernel. The greater the change in pixel intensity, the more significant the edge there is.</p>



<h2 id="b7e3">Convolution</h2>



<p id="43f6">The algorithm relies heavily on a mathematical operation called convolution.</p>



<p id="a297">Convolution is simply the process of multiplying and adding corresponding indices of two matrices together (the kernel and the image matrix) after flipping both the rows and the columns of the kernel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1704/1*h3mCQcE71ayqzhphzindrQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1704/1*h3mCQcE71ayqzhphzindrQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>The kernel on the left has its rows and columns flipped and then multiplied by the corresponding indices in the image matrix.</p>



<p id="7d73">The standard implementation of the algorithm uses the following 3×3 matrices for the&nbsp;<em>x&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;axis, respectively.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/974/1*8IyZO5lbk8Nk37opXhl0sQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/974/1*8IyZO5lbk8Nk37opXhl0sQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Pre-Convoluted Kernel (A is a matrix containing the image data)</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/455/1*VfpLiujnVqszZneW6zxQdA.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/455/1*VfpLiujnVqszZneW6zxQdA.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Convoluted version of the kernel above</p>



<p id="a71c">Now, we have completed all of the pre-processing and have the convoluted matrices in hand.</p>



<p id="d5af">We can iterate through all pixels in the original image and apply the image convolution kernels Gx and Gy at every step of the way. This convolution operation will return a single integer for each kernel.</p>



<p id="ea00">Here’s an example of what applying the Gx kernel on a specific pixel (in red) would look like:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*K6WODRbRy-jXSjrxkO2OUg.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*K6WODRbRy-jXSjrxkO2OUg.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>On the left is the original image with the 3×3 pixel group colored</p>



<p id="0fa7">The penultimate step is to create a new image of the same dimensions as the original image and store for the pixel data, the magnitude of the two gradient values:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/584/1*dY_BnICdMcnm9eyu9p7zwQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/584/1*dY_BnICdMcnm9eyu9p7zwQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="66aa">A recommended next step would be to normalize all of the data in the new image by dividing all the pixel values by the greatest gradient magnitude observed.</p>



<p id="414d">Now, you have a new grayscale image whose pixel intensities reflects how close they are to an edge in the original image. Naturally, the higher the gradient value for the pixel, the brighter the edge in the resultant image will appear.</p>

Specially if you are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin-silver-copper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead-free solder</a>, which I hope you are.</li><li>Do not underestimate <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg249.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soldering fumes</a>. That can give you even asthma.</li><li>A soldering iron gets <strong><em>very hot</em></strong>. Never put it on the floor or somebody will step on it at some point. Pain ensued.<ul><li>Get yourself a holder where you can put the iron <strong><em>inside</em></strong>, not just leaning over it.</li></ul></li><li>When soldering pins to a small board, insert the pin strip into a breadboard and use another pin strip to level the module you are about to solder.

They are enough for many tasks and you can also use them with Arduino if you are into that. Bad clones also exist so beware.</li><li>Alternatively, STM32F411 boards a.k.a. “<strong><a href="https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F401CCU6-WeAct-Black-Pill-V1.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USB-C pill</a></strong>“ are only slightly more expensive but the build quality and capabilities are much better.</li><li>Otherwise, STM32 <em>nucleo</em> and especially <em>discovery</em> boards are great.</li><li>If you are into Wi-Fi, ESP8266 boards are very cheap.

    <p>In June, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://pine64.org/">PINE64</a> reached out to see if elementary would be interested in experimenting with elementary OS on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/">Pinebook Pro</a>. We’d been loosely following PINE64 and the progress of Pinebook Pro, but hadn’t gotten our hands on one—so we expressed our interest. PINE64 was gracious enough to send a few devices out to members of our team, and our work began.</p>

  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro/card.jpg" alt="Pinebook Pro" width="2048" height="1364"></p>
</figure>

<p>First, a bit of a disclaimer: Pinebook Pro support is still considered an experiment for elementary OS, and it’s not something we have committed to officially support indefinitely. That said, the experience so far has been a lot of fun, and we’re happy with the current state. Second, this post isn’t going to get into a lot of details about the hardware itself; for that, see <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cassidyjames.com/blog/pinebook-pro/">Cassidy’s recent personal blog post</a>. Lastly, our work on bringing elementary OS to Pinebook Pro has been made possible by PINE64 generously providing the hardware as well as by funding from our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access</a> sponsors. If you’d like to see more projects like this, consider backing us on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-elementary-os-to-pinebook-pro">Bringing elementary OS to Pinebook Pro</h2>

<p>The process of producing both functional and high-quality builds of elementary OS for Pinebook Pro has been long, but was made substantially easier thanks to help from PINE64 and the work of other projects.</p>

<h3 id="kernel--bootloader">Kernel &amp; Bootloader</h3>

<p>Thanks to the great work that the Manjaro ARM team have done in this field, getting a working kernel for the Pinebook Pro was relatively painless. We’ve simply taken a mainline kernel straight from <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>, applied a few patches copied from the Manjaro repository and used a configuration set similar to the Manjaro one. It needed tweaking slightly to be compatible with the way Ubuntu/elementary works. For example, we’ve had to disable kernel module compression in the kernel configuration as this isn’t compatible with the Ubuntu <code>update-initramfs</code> scripts yet.</p>

<p>As of this post, Ubuntu hasn’t released any kernels that are new enough or contain the necessary tweaks, options, and patches to run on the Pinebook Pro. So this is one major area where the Pinebook Pro builds differ from the regular Intel/AMD builds. We were initially using kernel 5.7, but have since upgraded to 5.8, which allowed dropping some more patches that have been mainlined.</p>

<p>elementary normally relies heavily on the fantastic work done by Canonical in testing and maintaining kernel releases. So maintaining our own kernel configuration and patchset is a bit of a departure from that. Ubuntu already releases <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/linux-raspi">specific kernels for the Raspberry Pi</a>, perhaps we’ll see a ready made Pinebook Pro one in the future. In the short term however, we may consider packaging the Pinebook Pro kernel into a .deb and hosting it on a PPA, so we can push updates in future if necessary. For now, though, the kernel is just built into the image at build time and so <strong>does not currently receive updates</strong>.</p>

<p>The bootloader is a similar story. We needed a version that was new enough to support the Pinebook Pro and a few patches, so this has come directly from mainline u-boot and not yet packaged as an upgradable .deb.</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Despite elementary OS being a relatively performant distribution, the experience still isn’t as good as you might hope given the capability of the hardware. This is down to GTK3 largely not using GPU acceleration, especially when running on Xorg. There are a number of tweaks we’ve applied to improve the experience somewhat, though there won’t be any big leaps in performance until we can move the stack to Wayland and to a greater extent GTK4.</p>

<p>One interesting point is that you can clearly notice the difference between the GPU accelerated animations (done by the Compositor) and those done largely on the CPU by GTK. For example, the <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd> animation feels pretty smooth compared to the animation used when opening the applications menu. So the potential of the hardware is there, the software stack just isn’t quite ready to take advantage of it yet.</p>

<p>The first performance tweak we applied was disabling the <code>ondemand</code> CPU governor which is forced on by default as a systemd unit on Ubuntu. This allows the kernel to use the <code>schedutil</code> governor which has been enabled and set as the default in our kernel configuration. The <code>schedutil</code> governor is a much newer governor with an awareness of the different performance/power utilization levels of the big.LITTLE cores in the ARM CPU. Switching to this gave an immediate noticeable gain in performance.</p>

<p>Both <code>ondemand</code> and <code>schedutil</code> scale the frequency of the processor cores in response to load. However, if they aren’t doing this efficiently or if the CPU has delays or slowdowns while it’s switching frequency, you notice a bit of latency while the frequency picks up, then things feel a bit more speedy for a few seconds and then they slow down again.</p>

<p>We’ve opted to increase the minimum frequencies of both the CPU and GPU to reduce some of this sluggishness. This has the downside of reducing the battery life slightly. But given the already excellent battery life, we felt it was a reasonable trade-off.</p>

<p>If you wish to disable these frequency tweaks and have longer battery life but worse performance instead, you can comment out the lines in <code>/etc/tmpfiles.d/cpufreq.conf</code> and reboot.</p>

<h3 id="keyboard-and-trackpad-tweaks">Keyboard and Trackpad Tweaks</h3>

<p>We’ve applied three different configuration tweaks to get the keyboard and trackpad functioning better under elementary OS.</p>

<p>The first is some UDev configuration originated from Manjaro to correctly map the sleep (<kbd>Fn</kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd>) and brightness (<kbd>Fn</kbd><kbd>F1</kbd>/<kbd>F2</kbd>) keys on the keyboard. Some similar configuration tweaks could be used to essentially invert the <kbd>Fn</kbd> key (i.e. pressing the <kbd>F1</kbd> key would turn the brightness down and <kbd>Fn</kbd><kbd>F1</kbd> would function as F1), but we’re not sure if we will ship that by default.</p>

<p>The second tweak is some LibInput configuration at <code>/etc/libinput/local-overrides.quirks</code>. This file tells LibInput that the Pinebook keyboard is “internal”, as it automatically assumes USB keyboards (the Pinebook Pro keyboard is on the USB bus) are external unless it is told otherwise. This has the effect of allowing LibInput to “pair” the keyboard with the trackpad, meaning that when the “disable while typing” setting is enabled for the trackpad, it functions correctly. External keyboards do not disable the trackpad.</p>

<p>The final tweak at the bottom of <code>/etc/udev/hwdb.d/10-usb-kbd.hwdb</code> disables a device that the keyboard firmware reports as a “keyboard mouse”. We assume that the keyboard firmware has some provision for a Trackpoint-style pointer that doesn’t physically exist on the keyboard, but the firmware still reports it. Having this device enabled resulted in the trackpad being disabled if you enabled the “disable when external mouse connected” option. The phantom “keyboard mouse” device was again assumed to be external, meaning LibInput assumed you had an additional external mouse connected and that you didn’t want the trackpad anymore.</p>

<p>It’s possible that some/all of these tweaks are not necessary/useful on distributions that use the Synaptics driver instead of LibInput for the trackpad, but elementary OS uses LibInput by default.</p>

<h3 id="power-management">Power Management</h3>

<p>The biggest and most time consuming issue we came across while porting elementary OS to the Pinebook Pro was a sporadic issue with shutdown not powering off the device. Sometimes the power light would go off, but the device was still secretly on, draining battery and you had to hard reset by holding the power button and then powering on again. Other times the power light would flash red (indicating a kernel panic), and on occasion, it would shut down properly/normally.</p>

<p>Using a UART cable for debugging resulted in some kernel warnings about the i2c code for handling the shutdown call to the PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit) not being “atomic”. This turned out to be an important hint, but it is a relatively normal message that you’ll also see on other distributions using a similar kernel.</p>

<p>After much digging, it turned out that something in our stack pulls in a package called <code>irqbalance</code> by default. This distributes the hardware interrupts among the CPU cores to try and get better performance. The fact that the i2c code in the Rockchip driver is not atomic means that it relies on interrupts to function.</p>

<p>During shutdown, the kernel disables interrupts on all but the first CPU core. The fact that <code>irqbalance</code> has potentially told a different core to handle the interrupts for the PMIC is the problem here. It also explains the random/sporadic behavior. Removing the package was enough to fix the issue as the kernel has its own interrupt distribution code and is smart enough to ensure the interrupts are handled on the first core during shutdown.</p>

<p>A lot of ARM platforms handle power management functions like shutdown and suspend in a low level firmware interface called PSCI (Power State Coordination Interface). Instead of communicating directly with the PMIC chip like the current kernel in the Pinebook Pro image does, the kernel can communicate with the standardized PSCI API.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these shutdown and suspend interfaces are not yet implemented in the open-source ARM TF-A (Trusted Firmware-A) meaning these functions have been implemented in the kernel in a non-standard way. This is understandable given the amount of work required to implement these functions in the low level firmware. Hopefully, when these features are implemented in the firmware, it should be possible to drop these non-standard patches and hopefully have improved suspend power draw levels.</p>

<p>A lot of manufacturers of ARM platforms offer a BSP (Board Support Package), which can include closed source firmware and a custom kernel (which is now a relatively out of date version). Rockchip offers a BSP firmware image and kernel where the suspend performance is improved, but we’ve opted for up to date and more easily auditable versions of these components.</p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>

Unemployment rose to levels not seen since the Great Depression.</p><p>Shortly afterwards states around the country passed emergency laws to protect the most vulnerable people. In 32 states, governors and public utility commissions (PUCs) passed <strong>utility shut-off moratoriums</strong> to ensure that no households lost their electricity because they couldn’t pay their bill.</p><p>Six months later many of those moratoriums have expired or are set to expire in the next month. Between May and mid-August, 10 states allowed their moratoriums to expire. In the next month another 14 state moratoriums will expire. That means <strong>by October 1st a total of 36 states won’t have moratoriums in place.</strong></p><p>In order to understand the impact of these policy changes, Carbon Switch analyzed data provided by public utility commissions in these states, unemployment data, and energy spending data. Our goal was to understand how many people could be at risk of losing their electricity this year.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="2104617" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="847ece8" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="8833eed" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h3>Key highlights</h3><ul><li><strong>In the next month 34.5 million households will lose their utility shutoff protections as moratoriums in 14 states expire.</strong> About 4 million of those households are currently below the federal poverty line. 4 million people in those states are unemployed.</li><li><strong>76 million American households won’t have utility shutoff moratoriums after October 1st.</strong> By that point moratoriums will be voluntary in 36 states. About 10 million of the households in those states are currently below the federal poverty line.

When the statewide moratorium expires on September 1st they will all be at risk of losing their power.</li><li><strong>8 of the country’s 10 biggest utilities will shut off customers’ power by Sept 15.</strong> These utilities serve 53 million Americans. The only two utilities that won’t resume shut offs by September 15th are PG&amp;E and SCE, California-based utilities that legally can’t resume shutoffs until at least next year due to the state’s moratorium.</li><li><strong>Black families are twice as likely to have their power shut off as white families.</strong> According to the 2009 United States Energy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey African American households at or below 150% of the federal poverty level were shut off twice as frequently as white households (11.3% compared to 5.5%).</li><li><strong>Utility shutoffs cost lives, people’s health, and their dignity.</strong> Every year brings stories of people killed after their power is shut off (often due to fires and heat stroke).

As they wrote: “Between April 1 and June 30, 1,369,786 residential customer accounts have become eligible for disconnection but have not been disconnected.”</p><p>For context, there are 3,815,392 households in North Carolina meaning that more than a third of households are behind on payments.</p><p>Unfortunately little has changed in North Carolina since that July 15 report and the moratorium is set to expire on September 1st. According to the most recent BLS data, there are 419,812 unemployed people in the state (compared to 199,494 a year ago).</p><p>Wisconsin is another state that released data on how many customers are behind on their utility bills. According to <a href="https://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/5-ui-120_data_update_august_2020.pdf">a recent government report</a> about 33% of utility customers were behind on payments as of July (compared to 12% a year ago).</p><p>When surveyed for that report, 36 of the 41 utilities that responded said they planned to resume shutoffs. We Energies, a utility that serves 1,183,000 customers in Wisconsin said 32,000 customers met disconnect criteria (27% of their total).</p><p>But with millions of shutoffs looming the Public Service Commission in Wisconsin <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/wisconsin-regulators-extend-shutoff-ban-one-third-of-households-behind-on-utility-bills/article_e35facbb-0812-5a32-b213-a8761e3e5036.html">voted</a> to extend the moratorium until October 1st.</p><p>In Florida “accounts in arrears” (the industry term for customers that are behind on payments), are up 60% compared to the year before according to <a href="http://www.psc.state.fl.us/Files/PDF/Utilities/CovidWorkshop/FPL.pdf">presentations</a> by executives at the biggest utilities obtained by Carbon Switch.</p><p>Florida Power and Light, one of the country’s biggest utilities, had 250,000 accounts in arrears as of the end of June. The company began shutting off the power on customers in mid-July.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="4bc9e81" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="4fe6dd3" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="372bafe" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h3>Shutoff policies at the 10 biggest utilities</h3><p>In March utilities across the country announced that they would temporarily suspend shutoffs. Few of them specified when they would resume shutoffs. Many of them have quietly resumed shutting off the power on their customers in the months since. While others plan to resume shutoffs in mid-September. One of the country’s biggest utilities, Southern Company — a Georgia-based utility with 9 million customers — never had an internal shutoff moratorium in the first place.</p><p>Carbon Switch gathered data on the number of customers at the 10 largest utilities and their shut off policies. We found that the top 10 utilities control 62% of the investor-owned utility market and serve 63 million customers. (It’s important to note that a customer is a household, not an individual. Considering the average household in America has 2.5 people, their policies likely affect about 157.5 million Americans).</p><p>Here’s a summary of these utilities shutoff policies during the pandemic:</p><ul><li>1 utility (Southern Company) never stopped shutting off their customers’ power.</li><li>3 utilities (Exelon, Xcel, and Florida Power and Light) quietly resumed shutoffs in May and July.</li><li>4 utilities (Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, First Energy, and AEP) plan to resume shut offs in September.</li><li>2 utilities (PG&amp;E and SCE) are barred by California’s moratorium from shutting off their customers’ power until at least next year.</li></ul><p>It’s worth emphasizing that the only utilities that have extended their moratoriums past September 15th are the two utilities based in California, a state with the nation’s longest spanning moratorium. The others plan to resume shut offs despite recent reports that as many as a third of customers are behind on payments in some states.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="b958695" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="1240" height="974" src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1240/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1240/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2.png 1240w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-300x236.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-1024x804.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-768x603.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="bbfb297" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="fb983df" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="e7cba1b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h3>Shutoffs and injustice</h3><p>In 2018 a 72-year-old woman living in Sun City West, Arizona died during a heat wave in which temperatures reached 100 degrees.

		<p>by David L. Duffy.</p>
<p>Personally, I have found some chess analogies, metaphors and thought experiments from philosophers a little unimpressive, speaking as someone who was once a middling club player. Some philosophers have been what I think of as serious players – at least one has been an International Master — but I don’t see their thoughts as widely cited as, for example, Dennett in the case of “Chmess”, or even Sellars’ “Texas Chess”. Serious chess players know there is a technical literature of many thousands of books, and databases containing ~15 million games played since people started recording them. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> They know playing chess is intensely pleasurable and addictive, that winning well is a joy, but even losing is not so bad. Abuhamdeh and Csikzentmihalyi found that maximum pleasure in their study was felt when one’s opponent was 260 Elo points <em>stronger</em> (that is, one’s chance of winning was only 20%). <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Csikzentmihalyi calls chess as played by humans <em>autotelic;</em>&nbsp;that is, intrinsically motivating. Chess players know that chess-thought combines a mixture of “intuitive” pattern recognition and brute force mental visualisation of the future chess positions that will follow particular sequences of moves (“calculation”). They know and enjoy a family of variant forms of chess – I used to play a lot of “Transfer” (known as “Bughouse” in the US), which involves players passing captured pieces to their teammates, who may place them on their board, a la Shogi, but all under a time limit, as well as Kriegspiel where you and your opponent are unaware of each others’ moves, but are informed about captures and checks. <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Chess has been of great interest to the computer science community as what was seen as a hard problem for “machines do[ing] the things that would require intelligence if done by men” (Minsky 1968). Now <em>AlphaZero </em>has reached the highest levels in just 24 hours of self-play, it is seen as a trivial mechanical task, much easier than walking without falling over, or working out that the truck in front of your car is not the sky. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> When I played through the originally published <em>AlphaZero</em> chess games, I found them hilarious. They actually have a very human feel, as opposed to those played by conventional chess engines which search through the set of all possible moves a certain number of plies into the future of the current position. (Partly this was because neither program was using standard opening books.) <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> &nbsp;<em>AlphaZero</em>’s open source successor <em>lz0</em> (<em>Leela</em>) has a putative Elo rating of ~3400, about the same as <em>Stockfish</em>, while the best human is ~2800 (so the human might beat the program perhaps one game in a hundred). <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> &nbsp;Computer programs don’t enjoy chess, and don’t have an aesthetic response to beautiful combinations of moves. But the pleasures of the chess player are “merely” the subjective experience of successfully meeting a meta-cognitive goal, one that drives all playfulness, and the related goals of the aesthetics of thought. We get a dopamine rush from our comprehension of elegance, simplicity and complexity, and of surprise (some may remember Koestler’s <em>Ha!</em> and <em>Aha!</em>).</p>
<p>The rest of this essay will be a few comments about how various philosophers have interacted with the game of chess and the playing of chess, but before that I will present a little thought experiment of my own. Many comparisons have been made between the acts of playing chess and carrying out mathematical calculations or solving mathematical problems. If one is some kind of Chess Platonist, one has the image of a Universe of approximately 10<sup>40</sup> possible sequences of moves sitting out there. <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> The Dancing Pixies argument of Putnam, Searle, Bishop, and others is that, with the right interpretation, the interactions between atoms in a rock are computations and thus, for us computationalists, thought. <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; They could also be interpreted as all those chess games. So I now have a concretized Platonic Chess Universe sitting in my garden. One merely needs to <em>construct</em> the apparatus to extract the games from the rock, and if one wished to use these to beat your human opponent, construct a further method of filtering out all the winning games arising from the current position. There are a couple of stories in Stanislaw Lem’s <em>Cyberiad</em> that are relevant, but Mrs Beeton’s recipe for Stewed Rabbit may also apply. <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>(1) If I were asked to answer, in one sentence, the question “What was Wittgenstein’s biggest contribution?”, I should answer “His asking of the question ‘Can one play chess without the queen?’” (Wisdom 1952) <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Well, people spot weaker players a queen all the time, and don’t think anything of it. After all, you can lose your queen during a game anyway, and the resulting play is a subtype of standard play (usually endgame), rather than a new game. If one is playing the Old Indian Opening, for example, the players can choose to enter a Queen-less game in 5 moves. You might refine Wittgenstein and ask whether introducing a new set of rules specifying starting from a particular position (that is, setup of pieces on the board), or playing under the standard rules to get there is the same. Like, there are 10<sup>40</sup> different games lurking in there that people had never noticed before. In the Old Indian example, the players collaborate to reach a Queen-less board, but they may collaborate in all kinds of ways, such as repeatedly playing a particular chess opening variant they are both interested in (or in a grandmaster draw, as a strategy for winning a chess tournament).</p>
<p>(2) From Dummett’s explication of Frege on chess:</p>
<p><span>Proposition 1</span>: <em>Neither chess moves nor positions on the chessboard express anything; in particular they do not express thoughts that can be evaluated as true or false.</em> Proposition 2: <em>The theory of chess consists of meaningful propositions about chess moves and chess positions, capable of demonstration in the same way as mathematical theorems. </em><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>These seem plausible, but the way I think of chess soon led me to:</p>
<p><span>Analogical Proposition 1</span>: Neither bead moves nor positions on the abacus express anything; in particular they do not express thoughts that can be evaluated as true or false.</p>
<p><span>Analogical Proposition 2</span>: The theory of abacus use consists of meaningful propositions about bead moves and positions, capable of demonstration in the same way as mathematical theorems.</p>
<p>I think it obvious that AP1 and AP2 are incorrect. My preferred interpretation for the abacus: Bead movements and positions concretely express the evolution and states of abstract entities in a virtual time and space, whose properties are chosen to simulate those of other concrete objects.</p>
<p>My preferred interpretation for chess: Chess moves and positions on the chessboard concretely express the evolution and states of abstract entities in a virtual time and space, whose properties are chosen to simulate the concrete objects, actions and decisions of soldiers.</p>
<p>A: chess is a war game.</p>
<p>B: The warfare modeled by the rules of chess is ancient Indian warfare, with peasant infantry, elephants, aristocratic cavalry and chariots.</p>
<p>C: Winning such a battle required the capture or death of the opposition king.</p>
<p>D: Winning usually requires the general to sacrifice many of his own soldiers in order to win, unless the opponent has made an error.</p>
<p>E: A general fights against another general, and usually will plan as if his opponent will make the best response to any given attack, although he will set up traps with the hope they will succumb.</p>
<p>F: Each wields a Theory of Mind that is domain specific, and must incorporate both low-level and high-level properties of the game or the organisation of fighting. For example, chess players and generals both divide up the elements of planning into strategy and tactics.</p>
<p>My preferred conclusion: Although the game is greatly abstracted, there are many high-level analogies to warfare.</p>
<p>As it happens, Deleuze and Guattari make much of these isomorphisms in <em>A Thousand Plateaus&nbsp;</em>, as in the State of chess versus the Nomads of Go/Wei Chi – “chess pieces entertain biunivocal relations with one another, and with the adversary’s pieces: their functioning is structural, while Go pieces… have extrinsic relations with nebulae or constellations”, and so on. <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>My mental model of chess as simulation is therefore similar to a scientific model. There is the reality, the model that abstracts certain features of reality, and the theory that applies to the model. In a game, the pleasures arise in implementing and running the model, but are related to some of those of the reality (this is far more obvious in modern computer games). <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>G: Chess is rational imaginative play.</p>
<p>H. The physical acts of moving the game tokens around are <em>iconic</em> – horses jump, pawns bump into one another so that they can’t move forward, children and adults both use their piece to knock over the opponent’s piece they are capturing, the latter without sound effects. Blitz players pick up the captured piece and use it to tap the clock.</p>
<p>I’ll point to a related line of thought that is not particularly unique to chess. For children, the pastime of chess is supposed to produce transferable, that is, generalized, principles of learning and thinking, that apply more widely than just to warfare. <a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15] </a>One great goal of the AI community is to produce meta-reinforcement learners that can generalize (transfer) lessons from one domain to another domain.</p>
<p>I. Recall that Wittgenstein introduces Sprachspiel initially “as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language”.</p>
<p>J. By 2 years of age, children logically reason about outcomes of a counterfactual premise e.g. what should I do if this banana is a telephone, or which cup was emptied of imaginary tea by being knocked over.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>

<p>At the moment, the Epic Games page in the App Store is not available – journalist John Voorhees was one of the first to notice this. The store gives an error whenever you try to go to the page of the company itself or one of its applications using a direct link, but you cannot find it in the search.</p>




<p>Users also noted that downloading apps from Epic, including Fortnite, will not work, even if they are already assigned to a user account.</p>



<figure><img src="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple.jpg 289w, https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple-195x300.jpg 195w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px"></figure>



<p>Apple released an official statement on this matter – the company noted that they were “very sorry” to take such measures, but Epic left no choice.</p>



<blockquote><p>The court recommended that Epic follow the App Store’s guidelines and policies while the case is in progress – the rules they followed over the past ten years until they created the current situation themselves. Epic refused.</p><p><br> Instead, the company has repeatedly submitted Fortnite updates that violate store rules. This is unfair to all other developers in the App Store and makes users suffer from conflict.</p><p><br> We hope to be able to cooperate again in the future, but at the moment this is unfortunately not possible.</p><p><br> from Apple statement</p></blockquote>



<p>The corporation has warned that it is going to delete Epic Games accounts back on August 17th. Apparently, another account of the company, Epic International, is still available in the App Store – it was previously banned from blocking in court. Therefore, the situation should not touch upon the support of the Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>On the day Epic’s profiles were deleted, the App Store began to actively promote Fortnite’s direct competitor, PUBG Mobile. The online shooter appeared on the main page of the “Games” section, and the promo was published on the store’s official twitter.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The tweet was also noticed by the head of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While you wait for Fortnite to return to iOS and Mac, here’s another great Battle Royale powered by the Unreal Engine!</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://www.umsu.de/wo/2018/688 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.umsu.de/wo/2018/688">archive.org</a>

   <p>I recently refereed Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares's <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/">"Functional Decision
Theory"</a> for a philosophy journal. My recommendation was to accept
resubmission with major revisions, but since the article had already
undergone a previous round of revisions and still had serious
problems, the editors (understandably) decided to reject it. I normally don't publish
my referee reports, but this time I'll make an exception because the
authors are well-known figures from outside academia, and I want to
explain why their account has a hard time gaining traction in academic
philosophy. I also want to explain why I think their account is wrong,
which is a separate point.</p>

<p>I actually don't know Nate Soares, but Eliezer Yudkowsky is a
celebrity in the "rationalist" community. Many of his posts on the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality">Less Wrong blog</a> are
gems. I also enjoyed his latest book, <a href="https://equilibriabook.com/"><i>Inadequate Equilibria</i></a>.
Yudkowsky seems to be interested in almost everything, but he regards
decision theory as his main area of research. I also work in decision
theory, but I've always struggled with Yudkowsky's writings on this
topic.</p>

<p>Before I explain what I found wrong with the paper, let me review the
main idea and motivation behind the theory it defends.</p>

<p>Standard lore in decision theory is that there are situations in
which it would be better to be irrational. Three examples.</p>

<blockquote> <b>Blackmail.</b> Donald has committed an indiscretion.
Stormy has found out and considers blackmailing Donald. If Donald
refuses and blows Stormy's gaff, she is revealed as a blackmailer and
his indiscretion becomes public; both suffer. It is better for Donald
to pay hush money to Stormy. Knowing this, it is in Stormy's interest
to blackmail Donald. If Donald were irrational, he would blow Stormy's
gaff even though that would hurt him more than paying the hush money;
knowing this, Stormy would not blackmail Donald. So Donald would be
better off if here were (known to be) irrational.</blockquote>

<blockquote> <b>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin.</b> Twinky and her
clone have been arrested. If they both confess, each gets a 5 years
prison sentence. If both remain silent, they can't be convicted and
only get a 1 year sentence for obstructing justice. If one confesses
and the other remains silent, the one who confesses is set free and
the other gets a 10 year sentence. Neither cares about what happens to
the other. Here, confessing is the dominant act and the unique Nash
equilibrium. So if Twinky and her clone are rational, they'll each
spend 5 years in prison. If they were irrational and remained silent,
they would get away with 1 year.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes.</b> A demon
invites people to an experiment. Participants are placed in front of
two transparent boxes. The box on the left contains a thousand
dollars. The box on the right contains either a million or nothing.
The participants can choose between taking both boxes (two-boxing) and
taking just the box on the right (one-boxing). If the demon has
predicted that a participant one-boxes, she put a million dollars into
the box on the right. If she has predicted that a participant
two-boxes, she put nothing into the box. The demon is very good at
predicting, and the participants know this. Each participant is only
interested in getting as much money as possible. Here, the rational
choice is to take both boxes, because you are then guaranteed to get
$1000 more than if you one-box. But almost all of those who
irrationally take just one box end up with a million dollars, while
most of those who rationally take both boxes leave with
$1000.</blockquote>

<p>The driving intuition behind Yudkowsky and Soares's paper is that
decision theorists have been wrong about these (and other) cases: in
each case, the supposedly irrational choice is actually rational.
Whether a pattern of behaviour is rational, they argue, should be
measured by how good it is for the agent. In <i>Newcomb's Problem with
Transparent Boxes</i>, one-boxers fare better than two-boxers. So we
should regard one-boxing as rational. Similarly for the other
examples. Standard decision theories therefore get these cases wrong.
We need a new theory.</p>

<p>Functional Decision Theory (FDT) is meant to be that theory. FDT
recommends blowing the gaff in <i>Blackmail</i>, remaining silent in
<i>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin</i>, and one-boxing in <i>Newcomb's
Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>.</p>

<p>Here's how FDT works, and how it differs from the most popular form
of decision theory, Causal Decision Theory (CDT). Suppose an agent
faces a choice between two options A and B. According CDT, the agent
should evaluate these options in terms of their possible consequences
(broadly understood). That is, the agent should consider what might
happen if she were to choose A or B, and weigh the possible outcomes
by their probability. In FDT, the agent should not consider what would
happen if she were to choose A or B. Instead, she ought to consider
what would happen if <i>the right choice according to FDT were A or
B</i>.</p>

<p>Take <i>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>. Without loss
of generality, suppose you see $1000 in the left box and a million in
the right box. If you were to take both boxes, you would get a million
and a thousand. If you were to take just the right box, you would get
a million. So Causal Decision Theory says you should take box boxes.
But let's suppose you follow FDT, and you are certain that you do. You
should then consider what would be the case if FDT recommended
one-boxing or two-boxing. These hypotheses are not hypotheses just
about your present choice. If FDT recommended two-boxing, then any FDT
agent throughout history would two-box. And, crucially, the demon
would (probably) have foreseen that you would two-box, so she would
have put nothing into the box on the right. As a result, if FDT
recommended two-boxing, you would probably end up with $1000. To be
sure, you know that there's a million in the box on the right. You can
see it. But according to FDT, this is irrelevant. What matters is what
<i>would</i> be in the box relative to different assumptions about
what FDT recommends.</p>

<p>To spell out the details, one would now need to specify how to
compute the probability of various outcomes under the subjunctive
supposition that FDT recommended a certain action. Yudkowsky and
Soares are explicit that the supposition is to be understood as
counterpossible: we need to suppose that a certain mathematical
function, which in fact outputs A for input X, instead were to output
B. They do not explain how to compute the probability of outcomes
under such a counterpossible supposition. So we don't get any details
spelled out. This is flagged as the main open question for FDT.</p>

<p>It is not obvious to me why Yudkowsky and Soares choose to model
the relevant supposition as a mathematical falsehood. For example, why
not let the supposition be: <i>I am the kind of agent who chooses A in
the present decision problem</i>? That is an ordinary contingent
(centred) propositions, since there are possible agents who do choose
option A in the relevant problem. These agents may not
follow FDT, but I don't see why that would matter. For some reason, Yudkowsky and
Soares assume that an FDT agent is certain that she follows FDT, and
this knowledge is held fixed under all counterfactual suppositions. I
guess there is a reason for this assumption, but they don't tell
us.</p>

<p>Anyway. That's the theory. What's not to like about it?</p>

<p>For a start, I'd say the theory gives insane recommendations in
cases like <i>Blackmail</i>, <i>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin</i>,
and <i>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>. Take
<i>Blackmail</i>. Suppose you have committed an indiscretion that
would ruin you if it should become public. You can escape the ruin by
paying $1 once to a blackmailer. Of course you should pay! FDT says
you should not pay because, if you were the kind of person who doesn't
pay, you likely wouldn't have been blackmailed. How is that even
relevant? You <i>are</i> being blackmailed. Not being blackmailed
isn't on the table. It's not something you can choose.</p>

<p>Admittedly, that's not much of an objection. I say you'd be insane
not to pay the $1, Yudkowsky and Soares say you'd be irrational to
pay. Neither of us can prove that their judgement is right from
neutral premises.</p>

<p>What about the fact that FDT agents do better than (say) CDT
agents? I admit that if this were a fact, it would be somewhat
interesting. But it's not clear if it is true.</p>

<p>First, it depends on how success is measured. If you face the
choice between submitting to blackmail and refusing to submit (in the
kind of case we've discussed), you fare dramatically better if you
follow CDT than if you follow FDT. If you are in <i>Newcomb's Problem
with Transparent Boxes</i> and see a million in the right-hand box,
you again fare better if you follow CDT. Likewise if you see nothing
in the right-hand box.</p>

<p>So there's an obvious sense in which CDT agents fare better than
FDT agents in the cases we've considered. But there's also a sense in
which FDT agents fare better. Here we don't just compare the utilities
scored in particular decision problems, but also the fact that FDT
agents might face other kinds of decision problems than CDT agents.
For example, FDT agents who are known as FDT agents have a lower
chance of getting blackmailed and thus of facing a choice between
submitting and not submitting. I agree that it makes sense to take
these effects into account, at least as long as they are consequences
of the agent's own decision-making dispositions. In effect, we would
then ask what decision rule should be chosen by an engineer who wants
to build an agent scoring the most utility across its lifetime. Even
then, however, there is no guarantee that FDT would come out better.
What if someone is set to punish agents who use FDT, giving them
choices between bad and worse options, while CDTers are given great
options? In such an environment, the engineer would be wise not build
an FDT agent.</p>

<p>Moreover, FDT does not in fact consider only consequences of the
agent's own …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By Leib Litman, PhD, Zohn Rosen, PhD, Cheskie Rosenzweig, MS, Aaron Moss, PhD, Adam Dietrich, &amp; Jonathan Robinson, PhD</strong></p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Lately, there’s been considerable debate over the accuracy of presidential polls. While recent polls show Joe Biden ahead,&nbsp;a number of pundits speculate that some Donald Trump supporters may be hesitant to share their true opinions when polled by phone. That hypothesis is gaining traction, leading some to argue that Trump may be leading despite what the latest numbers show. It’s also being fueled by the belief that 2020 will be a repeat of the 2016 election, when Trump polled poorly in advance of the election, but still went on to win the Electoral College vote.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the current debate on whether there are segments of Trump (or Biden) backers reticent to express their true opinions in phone polls, there’s been little empirical investigation into if the phenomenon actually exists. Pundits on major broadcast and cable news networks, such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/does-a-shy-trump-voter-exist-arnon-mishkin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/09/politics/trump-voters-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>, continue to speculate on the potential impact of so-called “shy Trump voters” on the outcome of the November presidential election result.&nbsp; In a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/us/politics/trump-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> published in <em>The New York Times</em>, David Winston says the following:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“The idea that people lie, it’s an interesting theory, and it’s not like it’s completely off-the-wall. But it’s obviously a very complicated thing to try to prove because what do you do? Ask them, ‘Are you lying?’”</em></p><p>On its face, a poll that asks people whether they lie in phone polls may not make much&nbsp;sense. After all, why would a person who lies in a telephone poll tell the truth about that in a different online poll? We here at CloudResearch reasoned that the issue may be methodological.</p><p>To explore this issue, we structured our survey to overcome shortcomings of previous polls. Instead of simply asking voters whom they will vote for — and then ask whether they just lied — we centered our research around a general question: “Are you comfortable in truthfully disclosing the presidential candidate you intend to vote for in a telephone poll?” Our rationale for this approach was that there’s a major difference between admitting you just lied and admitting to being genuinely concerned about disclosing your preferred candidate.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, we expected to find very few “shy voters.” After all, telephone surveys are supposed to be anonymous, so why would people be reluctant to share their opinions? However, to the extent people said that they were reluctant to express their voting preferences on a telephone poll, we were interested in their rationale for their reluctance. As a result, we included open-ended follow-up questions to better understand the factors that drive voters to fudge their responses.</p><hr><h2><strong>What CloudResearch Found</strong></h2><ul><li>11.7% of Republicans say they would not report their true opinions about their preferred presidential candidate on telephone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>In contrast, just 5.4% of Democrats say they’d be reluctant to share their true voting intentions — roughly half the number of Republicans reluctant to tell the truth on phone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>10.5% of Independents fell into the “shy voter” category, just a percentage point lower than how Republicans react to phone polls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>After asking about people expressing their true opinions on telephone calls, we then inquired about their preferred candidate. This ordering was important as we did not want to fall into the same trap as other pollsters who tend to lead with preference declarations. When we broke the responses down based on current Trump vs Biden supporters, we found the following:</p><ul><li>10.1% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys — double the number of Biden supporters (5.1%) reticent to share their true intentions.</li></ul><p>When respondents indicated that they were untruthful during polls, we followed up to confirm those responses, and then inquired as to why “shy voters” are concerned about sharing their voting intentions. Some example responses are below. These are just a representational sampling of viewpoints that we collected — sentiments not easy to gauge by responses to mere yes/no questions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I don’t believe the information would be confidential and I think it’s dangerous to express an opinion outside of the current liberal viewpoint.”</em></p><p><em>“Well I probably wouldn’t give my opinion period, but if pushed, I would not give my real opinion for fear of reprisal if someone found out.”</em></p><p><em>“Because most polls released to the public are slanted and aren’t scientifically based. So, they are messing with the results of the survey from the beginning by knocking down one party or the other. I’m just trying to right the ship.”</em></p><p><em>“I am hounded day and evening by phone solicitors.&nbsp; They interrupt me all the time; sometimes my irritation takes over, and I don’t answer correctly.”</em></p><p><em>“My answers could be recorded so I don’t really trust such phone conversations.”</em></p><p><em>“I do not discuss politics — let alone with a total stranger on the telephone.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t always trust phone call surveys. I wouldn’t want to be bombarded with phone calls and political mail.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t want my opinion associated with my phone number.”</em></p><p><em>“I am less anonymous, and somewhat ashamed of my opinion as it is frowned upon.”</em></p><hr><h2>In General, “Shy Voters” Cited Six Concerns:&nbsp;</h2><p>1. A lack of trust in phone polls as truly being anonymous.&nbsp;</p><p>2. An apprehension to associate their phone numbers with recorded responses.</p><p>3. Fear that their responses will become public in some manner.</p><p>4. Fear of reprisal and related detrimental impact to their financial, social, and family lives should their political opinions become publicly known.&nbsp;</p><p>5. A general dislike of phone polls.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Malicious intent to mislead polls due to general distrust of media and political pundits (though a sentiment expressed only by a few “shy voters”).&nbsp;</p><p>Such concerns were more often than not expressed by Republicans and Independents, and also by those who said they would vote for Donald Trump. Democrats and Biden supporters lagged both groups in terms of being concerned that their voting intentions would be shared with others.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our survey findings — that show a greater reluctance on the part of Republicans, Independents and Trump voters to disclose their opinions — should not be interpreted as outright lying. Rather, such reluctance seems to stem from a&nbsp; lack of trust in the anonymity of polls and a fear of the consequences if their opinions were to become public.&nbsp;</p><p>The results could have implications in terms of the true accuracy of phone polls; if Republicans, Independents and supporters of Donald Trump (regardless of party affiliation) are less likely to participate in polls or accurately disclose the candidate they support, that inherently generates biased poll outcomes.</p><p>Given razor thin-margins in the swing states, such bias may have important consequences, although more research is required to fully understand the potential magnitude of this effect. We intend to examine the magnitude of “shy-voter bias” in specific states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>The results of our survey also illustrate the primary concerns that pollsters may need to address to allay voters about the level of anonymity and privacy of phone polling. We’ll also examine these issues and potential remedies in future research.</p><hr><h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2><h3><strong>Sample&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Interviews were collected from two national online sample waves of 1,000 registered voters (2000 respondents in total), matched to U.S. Census data on gender, age, race, and region. Data were collected August 19 – 27, 2020. The two waves differed from each other in terms of how quotas were set. In the first sample, the full sample was matched to the U.S. Census and the sample was equally split between Republicans, Democrats and Independents. In the second wave, rather than matching the entire sample to the U.S. Census, each political party was matched to the demographic quotas appropriate for that party. The results presented above are for the first wave of participants, although the overall findings were similar across both waves. Specifically, in Wave 2, 10.5% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys compared to 4.6% of Biden supporters.</p><h3><strong>Survey Design&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Prior to entering the survey, all respondents were screened for attentiveness and English language comprehension. Following the screening process a <em>responsive verification protocol</em> was used, consisting of multiple interactive interview steps. Step 1 – Respondents were first asked one of two randomly assigned questions: Q1 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked in an automated telephone poll (also called “Interactive Voice Response” or “IVR”), would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. Q2 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked by a telephone interviewer, would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. We also wanted to compare how comfortable respondents are in responding to telephone polls, compared to online and in-person polls. We therefore also asked the same question about phone interviews, online surveys, and in-person polls, presented next to each other in the same grid. The response options to all questions were: 1. “I would definitely express my true opinion”, 2. “I would probably express my true opinion”, 3. “I would probably not express my true opinion” and 4. “I would definitely not express my true opinion”.</p><p>Step 2 – For those who indicated that they would not provide their true opinion on either question from Step 1 (i.e. responded with options 3 or 4), a follow-up question was asked: “On a previous question, you indicated that you may not express your true opinion over the phone about which presidential candidate you support. Sometimes people click on a button by accident, so we just wanted to verify your response. Are you …</p></div></div>

						<p>Why do psychiatric conditions exist?</p>
<p>This question is both unsatisfyingly unanswered and incredibly important. Here we will consider some features of the over-century-long failure of psychiatry to explain mental disorders, before reviewing a theoretical framework which promises to explain these conditions in a way which is not only scientifically sound, but emancipating. The framework in question is evolutionary psychiatry, and its principle thinking is simple: if we use evolutionary theory to explain biology, then we should be using evolutionary theory to explain psychiatric disorder. If evolution was given proper attention and integrated into mainstream psychiatry, we would usher in a new era of understanding and treatment of psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>Psychiatry is a practice with more than a chequered past, perpetrating horrors even in living memory: Sprees of lobotomising adults and children; purposefully inducing comas in schizophrenics, producing thrashing, spasming and salivating so bad that one psychiatrist reported the scene on a ward as alike to artist Gustave Dore’s depictions of hell; and the widespread demonisation of homosexuality justifying the electrocution and injection of homosexuals with nauseating drugs during slideshows of sexually attractive individuals of the same sex, hoping to train them into being sick at their own sexuality.</p>
<p>Advances in treatment over the decades have come more from the dismissal of old and harmful practices than the inception of new ones. As electrocution and nauseation were slowly recognised as both immoral and ineffective, we are now left with psychotherapies and pharmaceuticals of unreliable and underwhelming efficacy. Tens of billions of dollars and several decades of research have led to few new discoveries. Many drug developers have now left psychiatry for more easily understood and chemically pliable conditions of the body rather than the mind. Leaders in national mental health research have expressed dismay that so little progress has been made. Some research suggests that the burden of psychiatric illness might even be <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acps.13083">worsening</a>, not lessening.</p>
<p>Psychiatric therapies have never been atheoretical – psychiatrists have always justified their treatments with some school of thought: Freudian psychodynamic theories placed blame on early childhood and subconscious urges; behaviourism justified the application of pain to try and train people out of wrongthink; and more recently, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315533279_Challenging_the_Narrative_of_Chemical_Imbalance_A_Look_at_the_Evidence">chemical imbalance theories</a> were used to advertise pharmaceuticals, despite the narrative of simple dopamine and serotonin dysfunctions having been <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again">long dismissed</a> in academic circles. Recent advances in genetics and neuroscience have provided more evidence and complexity, but no promising new theories. Psychiatry today can be considered <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mind-Fixers-Psychiatrys-Troubled-Biology/dp/0393071227">a discipline in crisis</a>, surviving only because psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are effective for some people, some of the time, and so we still need them. The way is open for a new paradigm in psychiatric theorising.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the conclusion of his first edition of <i>Origin of Species</i> in 1859, Charles Darwin prophesied: “In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”</p>
<p>Darwin’s prophecy manifested itself in psychology around 100 years after his writing. Now, evolutionary psychology has become a common reference point for public discussion and academic research. Evolutionary psychiatry is a late follower, arising in the last years of the twentieth century alongside evolutionary medicine, its foundational work owing to Randolph Nesse, George Williams, John Price, and others.</p>
<p>Evolution by natural selection is the metatheory of biology, linking all species and all biological forms. The process of constant biological variation, reproduction and selection between forms leads to evolution of populations, explaining the form of our bodies and minds. Therefore, the logic of evolutionary medicine and psychiatry goes, evolutionary theory should also be referred to in explaining why our bodies and minds are vulnerable to disorder and disease. All biology is evolutionary, and psychiatry is biological, hence psychiatry should be understood in evolutionary terms. The lack of progress in understanding psychiatric disorders makes sense in this light, because mainstream psychiatry has been ignoring the key theory in biology.</p>
<p>Whilst the fundamental principles of evolutionary psychiatry have been defined, and important works <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Reasons-Bad-Feelings-Evolutionary-ebook/dp/B078VXFZCX">published</a>, there does not yet exist a dedicated evolutionary psychiatry university department or journal. In 2016, the first noteworthy institutional group dedicated to evolutionary psychiatry <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5046779/">was formed</a>, in the Evolutionary Psychiatry Special Interest Group (EPSIG) at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This slow start and long build up does not dissuade evolutionary psychiatrists from believing that, in the ever-less-distant future, this theoretical paradigm will be recognised as the way to truly start explaining mental disorder.</p>
<p>A unique advantage of evolutionary psychiatry is its ability to define disease and disorder upon an evolutionary concept of dysfunction. The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), the handbook of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), defines mental disorder as dysfunction, but then fails to specify what that means. This allows transparently unscientific activities. Most famously, in 1973, after gay rights protestors had stormed an APA meeting, psychiatrists had donned anonymising hoods and professed their personal homosexuality to a group of their fellows, and national progressive values became a little too loud to ignore, the APA called a vote to reconsider homosexuality’s status as a mental disorder. By a 58% majority, it was struck off.</p>
<p>Voting to decide whether a condition is a disease is not the sign of a mature science, yet to this day consensus alone is the deciding factor of whether a mind is deemed disorderly. Commonly prescribed disorder labels in use today, such as Borderline Personality Disorder, included in the DSM-III because of the vote of a dozen or so psychiatrists, have criteria <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650639/">based primarily upon</a> single review papers with poor empirical evidence from the 1970’s – even the authors of that paper expected it to be backed up with further evidence before becoming part of canon. In the most recent edition, the DSM-5, ‘internet gaming disorder’ was suggested, justified by comparing online (but specifically excluding offline) gaming to drug and gambling addictions. An international consortium has since <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.12457">voted</a> clarifying its features. Evolutionary psychiatry can thankfully supersede this ambiguous line between order and disorder.</p>
<p>Unlike physics and chemistry, which describe things simply as they are, biological processes can be meaningfully considered to function or dysfunction. Biological traits evolved to increase reproductive success – that is their function. Eyes evolved to see, so eyes which cannot see are dysfunctional. Psychological and physical traits functioned to provide reproductive success to our ancestors, and where that function fails or is interrupted, there is dysfunction. Mental disorders can then be defined as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119125563.evpsych242">harmful dysfunctions</a> of the mind.</p>
<p>This analysis of function is inevitably historical (it concerns ancestral evolutionary function, not modern functioning) and so is difficult to ascertain in many cases, especially in psychology, and is complicated by the possibility of random processes of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genetic-drift/">genetic drift</a>. Nevertheless, this reference to evolutionary function is the <i>only</i> way to define function by an objective biological process rather than relying solely on subjective norms and cultural values – or indeed a vote.</p>
<p>This unique theoretical strength has been followed up by work in evolutionary medicine and psychiatry identifying <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Articles/Nesse%20-%202015%20-%20Evolutionary%20Psychology%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf">six reasons</a> why conditions we define as disorder or disease (of body or mind) persist in evolved creatures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constraints on biological design, because evolution can only make alterations within a certain range.</li>
<li>Pathogens evolve, so we cannot evolve perfect immunity against them.</li>
<li>Design trade-offs and byproducts make perfection impossible.</li>
<li>Evolved defenses against disease and danger often induce harmful symptoms.</li>
<li>Selection is for reproductive success, not health, so we can evolve in ways which are debilitating if they allow us to reproduce more successfully.</li>
<li>Mismatch between evolved systems and modern environments lead to novel, harmful, reactions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these six reasons, it’s important to note that the last four are the modern result of functioning rather than dysfunctioning processes. The idea that natural selection would only encourage perfect health is mistaken. It’s entirely possible for evolution to lead our bodies and minds into states which we now diagnose and treat as disorders or diseases.</p>
<p>Work in evolutionary psychiatry has considered <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29051086/">depression</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2019/1/1/5229271">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/hunters-in-a-farmers-world-adhd-and-hunter-gatherers-2332-0915-1000150.pdf">ADHD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16005572/">OCD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9875960/">eating disorders</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">substance use disorders</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674370304800107">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603205_In_cold_blood_The_evolution_of_psychopathy">psychopathy</a>, and many more disorders through the evolutionary framework. Several can be explained as mental tendencies related to adaptations which were advantageous for our hunter-gatherer ancestors.</p>
<p>For instance, some are mismatched psychological systems which are exposed to over-stimulation in the modern environment, becoming the biggest causes of abuse, ruination and early death in developed countries. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">Alcoholism and drug abuse</a> manipulate natural chemical pathways which exist for evolutionarily advantageous reasons; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25749980/">obesity</a> by overeating is caused by natural desires for sweet and fatty foods; and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15577272/">gambling addiction</a> is likely linked to a history of continuously searching for scarce high-calorie food and other risky but rewarding endeavours.</p>

<p>Yep, thatâ€™s Rust code with embedded Objective-C syntax, and it works. Why would you do such a thing? Maybe you want tighter interop between the Rust and Objective-C parts of your iOS app. Maybe you want to write your iOS app <em>entirely</em> in Rust. Or maybe you just wanted to see if it was possible after your <a href="https://twitter.com/porglezomp">colleague</a>â€™s offhand remark.</p>

<p>(For me, it was the last one, absolutely.)</p>

<p>This post is going to walk through what it took to make this possible, so hereâ€™s a table of contents:</p>

<p>Sections 3-5 might actually be useful to other people looking to write Rust macros, so even though this project is a toy, you may still get something out of reading the post. However, if youâ€™re looking to use Objective-C from Rust in production, you should not be using my unsafe toy here. Instead, use Steven Sheldonâ€™s <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a>. Sheldon also has a blog post from near the start of the project that talks about <a href="https://sasheldon.com/blog/2014/11/28/interoperating-between-objective-c-and-rust/">his design process beyond the bare message-send implementation</a>.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to see the full source of my little monstrosity, you can <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/rust-inline-objc/">check out the repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-objective-c">Background on Objective-C</h2>

<p>My normal audience these days is probably Swift developers, but I expect this one to make rounds with at least some Rust people as well. Itâ€™d be easy for both groups to not have much direct experience with Objective-C, the primary language used by Apple for both macOS<sup id="fnref:osx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:osx">1</a></sup> and iOS since their releases in 2001 and 2007. So, hereâ€™s the quick summary: itâ€™s â€œjustâ€� C, except when you start working with â€œobjectâ€� types. And nearly everything you do with those objects is based on a dynamic dispatch model implemented in the <em>runtime.</em> Because of the two parts of that sentence (â€œdynamic dispatchâ€� and â€œimplemented in the runtimeâ€�), people have come up with a lot of clever and powerful techniques to make programs simpler, more expressive, or more extensible, though sometimes at the cost of security, secrecy, and stability.</p>

<p>More relevant to us, however, is that a language whose features are (nearly) all available in a runtime library is a language thatâ€™s easy to bridge to dynamically, as long as you donâ€™t have really tight performance constraints. So hereâ€™s the deal: nearly everything you do in Objective-C is calling methods by <em>sending messages,</em> and the way this works is that methods are regular C functions stored in a dispatch table keyed by a uniqued string called a <dfn>selector</dfn>. It is likely that the most heavily-optimized piece of code in Appleâ€™s libraries is <code>objc_msgSend</code>, which takes a <dfn>receiver</dfn>, a selector, and the arguments to the method, does a (cached) lookup of the selector in the receiverâ€™s classâ€™s dispatch table(s), and then jumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the method.</p>

<p>There are more things the Objective-C runtime exposes, but messages are absolutely the most important.</p>

<p>â€¦Oh, one more thing. Because Objective-C is an extension to C, it has to use syntax that doesnâ€™t conflict with C syntax. That means keywords with <code>@</code> signs in front of themâ€”one of the few symbols on the US keyboard that doesnâ€™t already have a meaning in Câ€”and a unique bracket-based â€œmessage sendâ€� syntax that takes a while to get used to:</p>

<pre><code>// Objective-C
NSString *fileStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:fileContents encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

// Pseudo-Swift
let fileStr: NSString = NSString.alloc().initWithData(fileContents, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Actual Swift
let fileStr = NSString(data: fileContents, encoding: .utf8)

// Pseudo-Rust
let fileStr: *const NSString = NSString::alloc().initWithData(fileContents, NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Idiomatic-ish Rust
let file_str = NSString::from_data(file_contents, NSStringEncoding::UTF8)
</code></pre>

<p>People almost universally think Objective-C syntax is ugly when they first see it, almost universally find it completely normal after a few years, and largely (though <em>not</em> almost universally) find idiomatic Swift easier to read even if theyâ€™re used to Objective-C.</p>

<h2 id="objective-c-from-rust-manually">Objective-C from Rust, manually</h2>

<p>From this point on youâ€™ll be expected to read Rust syntax without step-by-step explanations. Iâ€™ll try to explain whatâ€™s going on for my Swift and other non-Rust readersâ€”I myself am still a relative newcomer to Rustâ€”but itâ€™ll be pretty fast. This is <em>not</em> intended to be an introduction to Rust or Rust macros!</p>

<p>Given that the Objective-C runtime exposes a public API, we should be able to pretty much just call that from Rust, and indeed we can:</p>

<p>Now, this code should make most Rust users pretty horrified. It starts out okay, declaring some types and then declaring the Rust versions of the C API from libobjc. Then itâ€™s got a funny empty extern block to link the Foundation framework, but sure, thatâ€™s fine. And itâ€™s got explicitly-null-terminated strings because thatâ€™s what C-based APIs generally use. (Rust doesnâ€™t guarantee null termination by default, which makes slicing a Rust string easier.)</p>

<p>But then thereâ€™s a monstrosity of a line involving <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html"><code>std::mem::transmute</code></a>, Rustâ€™s equivalent of Swiftâ€™s <code>unsafeBitCast(_:)</code> or C++â€™s <code>reinterpret_cast</code> (and now <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast"><code>bit_cast</code></a>) or Câ€™sâ€¦well, okay, C doesnâ€™t have a direct equivalent, but a plain old cast when youâ€™re talking about function pointers like this. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html">docs for <code>transmute</code></a> even tell you to go use other things if possible.</p>

<p>So, what are we doing? Well, remember what I said about Objective-C and <code>objc_msgSend</code>: methods are regular C functions, and <code>objc_msgSend</code> â€œjumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the methodâ€�. That means that the correct way to call <code>objc_msgSend</code> is to <em>pretend it has the right type for the method youâ€™re calling.</em></p>

<p>In C (and Swift, for that matter), that conversion would require explicitly specifying the type of all arguments and return values. But Rust has really powerful type inference within a function body, and that extends to specifying only <em>some</em> generic parameters, and leaving others out.<sup id="fnref:swift-inference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:swift-inference">2</a></sup> In this case I need to specify that weâ€™re casting to a C function pointer with two arguments and a non-void return, but not anything more than that. The remaining information will be filled in based on how the function pointer is used.</p>

<p>With that, you should understand the (cursed) code above. Go ahead. Try it on your own machine (if your machine is a Mac).</p>

<h2 id="recursive-rust-macros">Recursive Rust macros</h2>

<p>Rust has a pretty robust macro system, so it wouldnâ€™t be impossible or even too hard to make a macro for â€œmessage sendâ€�. Thatâ€™s the route that the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a> takes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>url_class</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>NSURL</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>description_obj</span>: <span>*</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>url_class</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>description</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>description_obj</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>UTF8String</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>CStr</span>::<span>from_ptr</span><span>(</span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span>).</span><span>to_string_lossy</span><span>());</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But while thatâ€™s clearly the right choice for serious Rust work, I wanted something more ambitious. More integrated. Moreâ€¦ridiculous.</p>

<p>What I wanted was for Objective-Câ€™s messaging syntax, or something like it, to be valid anywhere in Rust code. It didnâ€™t have to be exactly Objective-C, but I quickly realized the <em>advantage</em> of Objective-Câ€™s syntax: itâ€™s delimited, i.e. itâ€™s a self-contained expression that can be dropped into something larger without changing how that larger thing parses. (Thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s bracketed in C as well.) Within the brackets, thereâ€™s basically two forms:</p>

<p><a href="https://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> has been JavaScript’s unofficial standard functional programming library for a decade (together with its major fork, <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>). Its most recent significant development is the move to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">ECMAScript 6 modules</a> (ESM). Underscore 1.11 is the first version to be fully modular.</p>
<p>With the new modularity, you can now create a custom build of Underscore with an even smaller footprint. At the same time, we still provide the standard UMD build, which is perfect if you want to get started quickly. The UMD bundle is easy to work with and it has great cache retention if you load it from a CDN.</p>
<p>Underscore was originally created by <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas">Jeremy Ashkenas</a> and he is still helping with the releases. Besides Underscore, he created several other awesome JavaScript libraries and tools, notably <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> and <a href="https://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>. If you haven’t heard about them yet, you should check them out.</p>
<p><a href="https://juliangonggrijp.com/">I</a> am not Jeremy Ashkenas, but I modularized Underscore. In this article, I will discuss the ins and outs of modular Underscore, and I will try to answer all questions you may have. The article is written Q&amp;A style, so you can read it once, then come back later and use it as a reference.</p>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-_">What is _?</h3>
<p>Besides a bunch of essential functions, Underscore exports an object named <code>_</code>, which is central to its functionality. Hence the name “Underscore”. <code>_</code> is all of the following at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>A namespace handle through which you can access the <code>VERSION</code> string as well as all the functions: <code>_.each</code>, <code>_.VERSION</code>.</li>
<li>The entry point for customizing the behavior of Underscore functions, currently through <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#iteratee"><code>_.iteratee</code></a> and <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#template"><code>_.templateSettings</code></a>.</li>
<li>The default placeholder for <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#partial"><code>_.partial</code></a>.</li>
<li>A special value wrapping function that enables <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#oop">OO style</a> and <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#chaining">chaining</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The role of namespace handle is probably the most well known. Before the advent of ES6 modules, having such a namespace handle was a necessity. There are many other libraries from this era that exploit the namespace handle to be a useful function as well. jQuery’s <code>$</code> is a famous example of this. While there is no longer a strong incentive to have a multi-purpose namespace handle, it continues to be useful, so we keep it around in Underscore. In ES6 module context, it is still the <code>default</code> export.</p>
<p>Arguably, the role of special value wrapping function is much more interesting. Thanks to this function, you can do <code>_.map(x, f)</code>, <code>_(x).map(f)</code> or <code>_.chain(x).map(f).value()</code>. These expressions are equivalent, and they share a single underlying implementation of the <code>map</code> function. The same applies to all other Underscore functions. This is made possible by having a standalone definition of each function, and then adding all functions to <code>_</code> with a single call to <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#mixin"><code>_.mixin</code></a>. It is a very elegant design; please take a peek at (the bottom of) the <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore-esm.html">annotated source</a> if you’d like to admire the details.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-monolithic-interface">What is the monolithic interface?</h3>
<p>The <code>_</code> object with its magical bells and whistles is made out of all the parts of the Underscore library. As such, <code>_</code> represents the whole library at once; this is what I mean by the monolithic interface. Historically, this used to be the <em>only</em> interface to the library.</p>
<p>Any module that provides <code>_</code> depends on all of Underscore. If your project imports something from such a module, even if you do not import <code>_</code> itself, then your project effectively imports all of Underscore. I refer to this as “using the monolithic interface” in a wide sense.</p>
<p>Don’t worry though! With modular Underscore, you can have all the tricks that <code>_</code> provides, such as chaining, and still be selective about which parts you want to import. Basically, you can create your own variant of the monolithic interface. I’ll cover the details below.</p>
<p>I should add that Underscore is both lightweight and widely adopted. Using the standard monolithic interface is a wise choice in many cases. More on this below as well.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-modular-interface">What is the modular interface?</h3>
<p>As of version 1.11, every individual part of Underscore can be imported from a separate module. Selectively importing these parts directly, instead of relying on a module that gives you the monolithic interface, amounts to using the modular interface.</p>
<p>There is a separate module for each Underscore function. Some of these functions, notably <code>mixin</code> and <code>chain</code>, can be used to create your own customized monolithic interface.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the modular interface brings powerful flexibility but also responsibility. The standard monolithic interface is well designed and coherent. If you choose to omit parts of it, you might end up with something that doesn’t do what you want.</p>
<p>I will detail the options and the pitfalls below.</p>
<h3 id="why-tiny-modules">Why tiny modules?</h3>
<p>In general, spreading the source code of a project over multiple modules promotes code reuse. If I can pick the code that I am interested in from your library, without having to import code that I am not interested in, then I am more likely to use the code that you already wrote, instead of reinventing the wheel. Everyone saves time and we get our flying cars sooner.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/pull/2849">modularized Underscore</a>, I went for the most extreme option: I put every function in a separate module. I did this in order to maximize the potential for code reuse. I want users to be able to select <em>exactly</em> the code that they need; no more, no less. I am already working on a library that will exploit this myself.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-treeshaking">What about treeshaking?</h3>
<p>In theory, I would not need to go all the way down to individual function modules in order to get perfect selectivity. Tools like <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">Rollup</a> can isolate individual functions from a larger module, a “trick” known as treeshaking. In practice, however, static analysis of JavaScript is hard. With everything being mutable and unsafely typed, it can be hard to tell whether one piece of code might influence another, especially without human intelligence, and the tools are far from perfect as a result.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/pull/2826">early stage</a> of my modularization effort, all of the exported functions were still pooled together in a single ES module. At this stage, I tested treeshaking with <code>_.map</code>. It sort of worked, in the sense that the result was only about half as large as the whole Underscore library. When I further split this module down to the individual functions, however, <code>_.map</code> shrank by another factor of 3. It turns out that <code>_.map</code>, and the other Underscore functions that it depends on, together make up only one sixth of the library.</p>
<p>\( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \), so there is a whole third of the Underscore code that Rollup is not able to treeshake. The only way to avoid needlessly importing that code is to manually isolate it in a separate module, which is exactly what I did.</p>
<h3 id="what-build-variants-can-i-choose-from">What build variants can I choose from?</h3>
<p>The source code consists of ESM modules. These modules live in the <code>modules/</code> package subdirectory and you can use them directly. From the source, we build several variants in order to cater to a wide range of use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>underscore.js</code> (in the package root), the monolithic UMD bundle. This file has the same path and the same format as older versions of Underscore. It is also still the <code>main</code> entry of the package, and it is the variant that you are most likely to use in the short term.</li>
<li><code>underscore-esm.js</code>, the monolithic ESM bundle. While fully supported, this variant is likely to see mostly experimental usage in the short term.</li>
<li><code>amd/</code>, the modular AMD build. This directory contains an AMD version of each source module.</li>
<li><code>cjs/</code>, the modular CommonJS build, analogous to the modular AMD build.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Monolithic bundle” in the first two build variants means both that the variant provides the monolithic interface, and that it is entirely contained in a single file.</p>
<p>Naturally, only the modular variants support modular usage. All variants support monolithic usage, but for efficiency, it is best to use the monolithic bundles.</p>
<h3 id="why-have-monolithic-build-variants">Why have monolithic build variants?</h3>
<p>Modules are useful, but the monolithic bundles have some compelling advantages as well (besides backwards compatibility):</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is easier to read and it is easier to see the big picture. This is why we render the <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore-esm.html">single-read annotated source</a> from the monolithic build. Although it can be fun and somewhat illuminating to discover the code by clicking through <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/modules/index-all.html">the annotated modules</a>.</li>
<li>Reading a single large file from a file system is substantially faster than reading many small files.</li>
<li>On the web, sending a single request with a large response is substantially more efficient than sending many requests with small responses.</li>
<li>Since Underscore is such a major library, cache retention is likely to be very good if you embed the standard monolithic bundle from a CDN, especially the UMD bundle. More on this in the next sections.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-a-cdn">What are the benefits of a CDN?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/using-a-cdn-to-speed-up-static-content-delivery">CDNs</a> are <em>awesome</em>, especially for open source libraries. In a nutshell, websites often use the same resources—such as Underscore—and by referencing those resources from a common URL, instead of hosting their own copies, they enjoy <em>collaborativ…</em></p></article></div>

	<p><img alt="SQUADS HAVE EXISTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS" src="https://otherinter.net/squad-ancient.png"></p>
<p>Recent events&nbsp;have completely exposed the limits of individual agency, creating a powerful demand for squad-based forms of resiliency. The COVID-19 pandemic is the most recent of these social bonding agents: though we're <em>physically</em> distancing, <em>emotionally</em> we're getting closer. First priority when the virus dropped was securing your squad. The need for group coordination and decision-making soon followed.</p>
<p>But today's emerging culture of group cohesion is driven equally by the social and financial precarity of urban life. <em>Family are those we share space and rent with</em>. Priced out of tier-1 cities, individuals have banded together to survive a jobless market with no social safety net.</p>
<p>Squads are both a product of—and a response to—contemporary social atomization. The trope of "getting a place upstate" signifies young city-dwellers' desire for new kinds of squad-based homesteading. HOMESQUADING is a modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-the-land_movement">back-to-the-land movement</a>—swap Whole Earth-inspired post-war communes with post-internet surf clubs microblogging the virtues of cooperative housing, permaculture gardening, and solar-powered mesh networks.</p>
<p>Squad culture is the antithesis of neoliberal individualism. Millennials are healing from decades of irony poisoning, rediscovering what it's like to have generative, exploratory relationships with one another. Younger generations are already imbued with extremely powerful squad energy, equipped with formative experiences in Minecraft, DOTA 2, and Fortnite parties.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-ngram.png" alt="Military connotations aside, the arrival of group DMs ushers a new age of &quot;SQUAD&quot; discourse."></p>
<p>Military connotations aside, the arrival of group DMs ushers a new age of "SQUAD" discourse.</p>
<p>Whether bound together for survival or for lols, the squads formed by today's crisis will be resilient. Distance is no longer a barrier with the closeness of network space—soon vital culture will be predominantly enacted by fictive kin. Group collaboration is now the strong default, putting squads at the center of social, cultural, and economic life. To paraphrase Bill Bishop: today people are born as individuals, and have to find their squad.</p>

<p>While ancient squads were brought together by the struggle for survival, always-on group communication sets the scene for contemporary squad culture. Group chats and adapted team workspaces create shared context and institutional memory. One necessary condition of the squad is this sense of <em>persistence</em>: co-presence and continuous availability to one another.</p>
<p>But the squad is more than a loose network of affiliations, it's a coherent body. A second prerequisite of squad formation is self-recognition. It's not you or me. It's <em>Us</em>. <em>We.</em> <em>Ours</em>. This pillar often follows from the first. Squads may start as one-off Telegram channels, but they soon become "The Group Chat," a metonym for the squad itself.</p>
<p>For the squad to understand itself as a whole, it maintains boundaries circumscribing strong group norms. Fuck a Dunbar number—the ideal squad count is no more than 12. How can you really be <em>present</em> with more than a dozen people? Small groups are crucial for tight coordination. A greater network may surround the squad, making it appear big and fuzzy from the outside. But for the core crew, an invisible circle binds and protects a space of group identity.</p>
<p>As SQUAD VIBES grow, so does the possibility of interdependence and resource sharing—social, emotional, financial. Trust brought by consistent socialization and self-recognition is a foundation for exploring what the squad is capable of together. SQUAD CULTURE has only just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvJ7yW7Y3RY">begun</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-theory.png" alt="Theory of the squad"></p>

<p>The pandemic flipped the script on sharing space IRL, but our newly domestic reality only brought to the physical world what was already extremely online. Originally conceived as series of linked documents, Web 2.0 mass productization turned the internet into a series of linked interiors.</p>
<p>Today's squads are expressions of digital locality and the new squad era forces us to reconsider the individuated logic of early social networks. Contrary to early visions of hypertext, the internet is not a singular World Wide Web, traversed by individuals. To be online today is to enter the global arena. Mass social media are hazardous PvP zones no one should traverse without team support.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-network-groupings.png" alt="Network graph of twitter with people-based groupings"></p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-network.png" alt="Network graph of twitter"></p>
<p>The Twitter subcultures shown above are only a sliver of an expansive social deep web. Beneath this fuzzy graph is SQUAD SPACE, the network of inner-zones where digital microcultures are born: group DMs, Discords, Slacks, Keybases. Memes forged in SQUAD SPACE bubble out into the "clearnet" above, pwning NPCs on the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">internet of beefs</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-spaces.png" alt="Evolution of squad spaces"></p>
<p>Squad culture is downstream of squad space, and the digital places squads inhabit are only getting more advanced. The Discord can suddenly be on calls together. The Keybase can now use Git. <a href="https://subpixel.space/entries/come-for-the-network-pay-for-the-tool/">The team toolkit defines its capabilities</a>, and different platforms enable different modes of squad thought. Squad space is more than environment, it's a collective body, a shared cognition layer. Squad space is where market-moving trades are planned, conspiracies are conceived, and memes are spawned. Members of the squad may live in different geographies—but within this space, everyone is on SQUAD TIME. <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memes/">The founding of a new group DM is year zero</a>.</p>
<p>Group dynamics ebb and flow with their environment, and nowhere more than SQUAD SPACE. Ecology calls this process “niche formation.” Online it's SQUAD CULTURE.</p>

<p>Inside the subterranean caves of the social deep web, chosen-kin groups grow their own culture. The squad doesn't need its own micro-currency—images, art, music, takes, shitposts, and, indeed, roasts are the native medium of exchange. Likewise squads have little use for internal financial incentives. Instead, playful exchanges produce trust, reciprocity, and VIBES—the ineffable group energy that squads value most. Accordingly, the core of squad production is the continuous production of the squad itself.</p>
<p>Evidenced by the power of crypto memetics, ragtag squads of shitposters have the power to define new forms of value based on their own esoteric social frameworks. Memeing produces "assets" that cannot be traditionally valued, but are capable of commanding cultural and economic movements.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-vibes.png" alt="Examples of squad vibes, including Twitch plays Pokemon, Chainlink $LINK Marines, Weird Sun Twitter, Brockhampton, Tik Tok Hype Houses, Theory of Vibe by Peli Grietzer, Bitcoin, and Headless Brands"></p>
<p>Memes, hot takes, internal language, 𝓪𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓬𝓼... artifacts that can only be formulated as a group are the mainstay of squad production. The group exudes potent SQUAD VIBES, and vibes attract. Outsiders want to share the vibe—sometimes for the social capital, sometimes because the content produced is of strategic value, and always because the energy is infectious. After enough fire in the group DM, some squads begin to externalize their social products. Podcasting is obviously a squad technology. Rapid publishing turns memes into whitepapers, quickly flooding the marketplace of ideas with locally-grown squad humor.</p>
<p>Whether formed by necessity or chance, once together the squad's potential for creative production is immeasurable. <a href="https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/?lang=enview">VIBE</a> is an unstable substance of high informtion density. In formalizing their vibes, squads may accidentally give birth to <a href="https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/">headless brands</a>, virtual personalities, and pseudonymous entities they may not even be able to control. Thus the squad transitions from its youthful, entropic state, harnessing its vibes to create a source of unfathomable squad energy.</p>


<p>Group identity. Shared space. Vibes. These not only enable the creation of social capital, but strengthen the squad's capacity to organize, minimizing transaction costs and leading to greater productive capacities and resilience; this is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm">the nature of the squad</a>." But while squads can be viewed as a "nexus of contracts", unlike the Coasean firm, they are without legal structure. Social contracts are instead effected through the unspoken bonds of <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/the-vibes-theory-of-organisational-design-937a73f791cd">mutual respect and ingroup norms</a>.</p>
<p>But to sustain this solidarity economy the squad may look for ways to translate vibes into monetizable modes of public engagement: clients, subscribers, sponsors, music deals, yields. SQUAD PRODUCTION begins with the creation of processes and interfaces to convert creative labor into units that can be transmitted by global network participants. Here SQUAD TOOLS come into play. Vibes generated at the DAW, on the Figma board, or in the gaming lobby are turned consumable cultural instruments. Then it's just a matter of distribution. Young artists create online galleries and independent labels because they allow groups to interact (and transact) with the world through familiar organizational patterns. Bandcamps, Twitch pages, DAOs are public APIs for squads to interact with entities beyond their trust boundary.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-trust-stream.png" alt="Example of a Twitch stream from Berlin-based Trust (squad)"></p>
<p>Some digital tools are public interfaces, while others are used to coordinate internally. Today this SQUAD INFRASTRUCTURE is comprised of simple software primitives: Venmo, Splitwise, Cash App. These apps are financial plumbing that facilitate internal coordination between squad members by minimizing the awkwardness of asking your friends for money. Despite the strong demand for SQUAD RESILIENCY, the social stigma of group finances is still a major barrier to economic exchange among friends.</p>
<p>In-app mechanics like budget trackers, polls, and coin-flips offer a half-way point between social agreements and technical solutions. For instance Splitwise relies heavily on the social norms to ensure expenses are entered accurately. By allowing individuals to opt-in to a set of rules for retroactive settlement the group's social friction and coordination costs are reduced. Civilization advances by extending the number of important functions squads can perform without thinking.</p>
<p>Some believe new software can liberate "individual creators." But this kind of thinking inevitably leads to Uberized platform-mediated wage labor. We want to liberate squads. <em>The <strong>group</strong> is the basic user class for the tools we need today as a society, yet few pieces of software allow the squad as a whole to produce cooperatively and generate wealth together</em>. To fully realize SQUAD CULTURE this must change.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-2x2.png" alt="Squad collectivism is a better form of autonomy than neoliberal individualism"></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<div>
						<p>It’s easy to imagine that governments were always as bureaucratic as they are today. Certain policies, like the widespread granting of monopolies in the seventeenth century, or the presence of a powerful landed aristocracy, seem like archaic products of a past that was simply more corrupt. The fact that governments rarely got involved with healthcare or education before the mid-nineteenth century seems the product of a lack of imagination, or perhaps yet another product of our ancestors’ venality – simply what happens when you put the war-hungry knights and nobles in charge.</p>
<p>But the bureaucratic state of today, with its officials involving themselves with every aspect of modern life, is a relatively recent invention. In a world without bureaucracy, when state capacity was relatively lacking, it’s difficult to see what other options monarchs would have had. Suppose yourself transported to the throne of England in 1500, and crowned monarch. Once you bored of the novelty and luxuries of being head of state, you might become concerned about the lot of the common man and woman. Yet even if you wanted to create a healthcare system, or make education free and universal to all children, or even create a police force (London didn’t get one until 1829, and the rest of the country not til much later), there is absolutely no way you could succeed.</p>
<p>For a start, you would struggle to maintain your hold on power. Fund schools you say? Somebody will have to pay. The nobles? Well, try to tax them — in many European states they were exempt from taxation — and you might quickly lose both your throne and your head. And supposing you do manage to tax them, after miraculously stamping out an insurrection without their support, how would you even begin to go about collecting it? There was simply no central government agency capable of raising it. Working out how much people should pay, chasing up non-payers, and even the physical act of collection, not to mention protecting that treasure once collected, all takes substantial manpower. Not to mention the fact that the collecting agents will likely siphon most of it off to line their own pockets.</p>
<p>As a monarch in 1500, you would be forced to rely heavily on delegation. As the economic historian Jared Rubin emphasizes, every ruler requires agents to propagate their rule. These can take the form of big burly blokes with heavy weapons — your enforcers — and they can take the form of people spreading the ideology of your right to rule, lending your orders legitimacy and more generally spreading social norms of obedience — the local officials, jurists, and clerics. Crucially, these propagating agents needed to be kept on-side at all costs. Hence the tax exemptions for nobles, many of whom were rich enough to support their own private armies, and whose ancestors might have been granted such a privilege by one of your predecessors.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc’s village, for example, was exempted from taxation <i>forever,</i> because of her role in restoring the French king’s military fortunes. And hence the control often exerted over policy by religious figures, who could give one’s rule divine sanction in the eyes of the people. It is no surprise that the emperors of China carefully cultivated themselves at the head of as many religions as possible (one of the reasons that Christianity, with its rather awkward stress on Jesus being the king of kings, was occasionally banned from the empire). As economic historians Mark Koyama and Noel Johnson argue, this focus on appeasing religious legitimisers was one of the reasons rulers so often sought to stamp out heretics and heathens.</p>
<p>Even beyond satisfying the propagating agents, however, core state activities like tax collection were heavily reliant on delegation of authority. Absent an expensive bureaucracy to do it on your behalf, it was much easier to farm out the activity to others. When taxing a predominantly agrarian society — in 1500, only 3.6% of England’s population lived in cities — it made most sense to appoint a local noble to be tax farmer for an area. As a local, they would know the area well, and the products of the land are relatively straightforward to tax. It’s not exactly easy to hide. And as for the tax farmer, they could be remunerated by taking a cut of what they collected. Corrupt, yes. But inevitable and even seen as legitimate, given the lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>Your capacity as a ruler was thus entirely governed by the <em>quid pro quo</em>, and heavily restricted by the deals made by your predecessors. Cities were granted charters, giving them various rights of self-governance, in return for collecting taxes from among their own members (commerce and industry being much harder to tax than land, and thus requiring more consent). And, of course, there were occasionally times when the defence of the realm might require extra taxes — for such instances, rulers convened parliaments. Taxes raised by parliaments were referred to, somewhat confusingly, as “subsidies”. But that is exactly what they were: special subsidies granted to the monarch, by the collected representatives of the nobles and the various other propagating agents, for a one-off extraordinary purpose – albeit giving those collected agents some say over policy.</p>
<p>It was not until 1689, when there was a coup, that an incoming ruler allowed the English parliament to sit whenever it pleased. Before that, it was convened only at the whim of the ruler, and dispersed even at the slightest provocation. In 1621, for example, when James I was planning to marry his heir to a Spanish princess, Parliament sent him a petition asserting their right to debate the matter. Upon hearing of it, he called for the official record of parliamentary proceedings, personally ripped out the page with the offending vote, and promptly dissolved the Parliament. The downside, of course, was that James could not then acquire any parliamentary subsidies.</p>
<p>Ruling was thus an intensely personal affair, of making deals and finding ways to circumvent deals you had inherited. Increasing your capabilities as a ruler – state capacity – was thus no easy task, as the typical ruler was stuck in an essentially medieval equilibrium. Imposing a policy costs money, but raising money involves imposing policy. Breaking out of this chicken-and-egg problem took centuries of canny leadership. The rulers who achieved it most would today seem hopelessly corrupt.</p>
<p>To gain extra cash without interference from Parliament, successive monarchs first asserted and then abused their ancient prerogative rights to grant monopolies over trades and industries. They eventually granted them to whomever was willing to pay, establishing monopolies over industries like gambling cards or alehouses under the guise of regulating unsavoury activities. They also sold off knighthoods and titles, and in 1670 Charles II even made a secret deal with the French that he would convert to Catholicism and attack the Protestant Dutch, all in exchange for cash. Anything to not have to call a potentially pesky Parliament. At times, the most effective rulers even resembled mob bosses. Take Elizabeth I’s anger when a cloth-laden merchant fleet bound for an Antwerp fair in 1559 was allowed to depart. Her order to stop them had not arrived in time, thus preventing her from extracting “loans” from the merchants while she still had their goods within her power.</p>
<p>Yet, ironically, it was when monarchs lost control that they did most to boost the capabilities of the centralised state. It was under Parliament, first in the 1650s when it briefly overthrew the monarchy, and then from the late 1680s following its deal with the usurping William III, that British state capacity began to most rapidly and inexorably grow. Likewise, in France, it was following the French Revolution that the steady rise of state capacity was boosted — it was then, over three centuries after the fact, that the perpetual tax exemptions for Joan of Arc’s village were finally rescinded.</p>
<p>Parliaments, as bodies of legitimising agents, despite their lack of representation in any modern democratic sense, had the unquestioned legitimacy with which to raise taxes, change policy, and undo the deals of previous monarchs. In the process, they often trampled on the ancient liberties of citizens and subjects. But, unlike monarchs, they found it much easier to force the changes through. When motivated by the needs of war — often the one thing members could agree on — parliaments in the eighteenth century were able to raise cash that would have been unfathomable to the monarchs of even a few decades before. And it was parliaments, also, that were eventually susceptible in the nineteenth century to the lobbying of those who wished the state to involve itself in areas like education, health, and policing.</p>
<p>The route to state capacity thus took centuries of blood, dirty dealing, corruption and campaigning to make the states we have to today. But it is difficult to see how it could have been done in any other way.</p>

<p>In 2017, we were to launch a big project in July. I missed the deadline, we had to push the launch by 2 months.</p>



<p>In 2018, another major launch, we missed the deadline again by almost a month and half.</p>



<p>In 2019 April, we started a project, set the launch date on 15th August. Huge project in totally different territory (Brazil). Launched it on the promised date.</p>



<p>We decided to launch MyGlamm V2 on March 9th, 2020. Launched it on March 9th, before everyone wakes up. If I recollect it correctly, it was 5AM in the morning.</p>



<p>If you look at chain of events, we have managed to launch things on time from missing the deadlines.</p>



<p>How did this happen, what’s the art behind it? Frankly speaking, it’s not a rocket science. </p>



<p>First and foremost, know the project from inside out. Leave less room from ambiguity. Most of the times, the main reason for delay is lack of clarity, not lack of skills. Engineers often end up giving estimates based on what’s in their mind not what is the exact requirement. So you must always communicate requirements very clearly and also understand what the chain below you have understood.</p>



<p>Second, break everything into smaller milestones. Many times, we keep large milestones, find out the problems late which in turn delays the project. Smaller milestones will help you to catch the problems quicker.</p>



<p>Third, set the realistic deadline and start thinking in reverse way to reach the goal. For example, to launch something on x date, what will you need? Break those things in small chunks and go after those.</p>



<p>Fourth, Keep calm and … This is actually for you. As a manager, you really need to keep calm, avoid noise around everything and THINK. In 2019 August launch, we achieved something which the other team could not do it in 4 years. It was a huge task but we pulled it off. </p>



<p>In March 2020 again, it was a really really huge task, moving an already running tech architecture in smaller services without downtime and that too have to take care of real time migration of users, orders and what not.</p>



<p>On these both huge launches, I did not care about the noise i.e. how big the project is, what if we fail etc.. all these things, according to me are immaterial. My thought process is: I have spare parts of the engine with me, I just have to fit them properly to build a well oiled machine. Rest is noise for me.</p>



<p>Manager’s job is to ensure the head is clear and calm so when team members need the support, we help them to solve their problem not create more problems.</p>



<p>Another important thing is, if you want to succeed as a team, have full faith your team, make deadline very very transparent. I generally do not keep 2 dates, for me it’s one date, which is final. For our V2 launch, I was extremely clear that 9th March is the date, not 10th or 11th. Everyone has to work as a team to achieve that. Problems? Yes, there will be plenty of them, we will resolve as a team. Keep the team motivated and engaged all the time.</p>



<p>Lastly, start preparing the list of launch day activity, get the team leads, project / product managers involved. Note down every small thing which is required or to be checked. This will be extremely critical in case you are moving already running system to a new one.</p>



<p>I know, at this point, you must be thinking “I know all these things”. Yes, we all know these things but we never think about these simple points. </p>

The Storage Spaces Pool does include two physical 512GB NVMe drives with one Virtual Disk on top configured as simple (striped) volume. Right now I don’t know how they did it, but it seems now possible to boot Windows from a Storage Spaces Virtual Disk with the Windows 10 Creators Update or some Surface team magic. Then when Storage Spaces was introduced with Windows 8, boot from Storage Spaces was not possible.</p><p id="jp-relatedposts"><h3><em>Related</em></h3></p></div><br></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It takes roughly 2 weeks to form a habit; it takes roughly two weeks to get comfortable in a new environment. A common mistake is to treat a new report’s first couple weeks like college orientation - social, light hearted, get-to-know-you stuff. If your report spends the first two weeks reading C# documentation and having lunch out on the town with the team, guess what, they’ve just normalized that behavior as what the role is.</p>

<p>The answer: start your report doing real work as soon as possible. If they’re a software engineer, they should be committing code week one (ideally day 2 or 3); If they’re a product manager, they should be attending meetings and picking up supporting activities on a similar time frame. Then the tone has been set - working here means getting things done.</p>

<p>This means as manager you need to give your report tractable work in the first week. Managers not being ready for a report to start is the number one reason people end up normalizing underperformance, because they had nothing meaningful to do. If a manager describes a report as not having initiative in the first couple weeks it’s a red flag - it’s the manager’s job to provide new hires with clear paths to contribute immediately.</p>

<p>Another main reason people fall into onboarding traps is because your organization has painfully slow onboarding. Endless HR videos, slow security processes, a mountain of fragile technology setup - these all make for a shitty and counterproductive start at a company. Optimize your onboarding to get people doing what you hired them to do. Look to formalize performance indicators of your onboarding. For example, for engineers this could be time-to-first-commit and time-to-joining-sprints.</p>

<p>This approach holds for managers and executives as well. In that cohort it’s also common and a common red flag for people to spend the first couple weeks putzing around under the guise of “getting to know what’s going on”. Managers and executives should be involved in the decisions of the team from day 1 and developing artifacts - plans, TODO lists, strategy documents - in the first couple weeks. With good managers and executives you see them day 1 adding perspective and insight into conversations, and everyone collectively appreciates that the right person has been hired.</p>

<p>Onboarding is one of the most critical periods in a person’s time at a company. It’s one of the highest ROI periods when managing someone. Take that opportunity to set expectations properly and measure success quantiatively.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

              
              
                              <p>Unit testing. It’s one of those situations that every engineer faces.</p>
<p>If you’re dealing with a downstream dependency, you’ll want to keep your unit test fast, self-contained, and reliable.</p>
<p>It can be daunting when you’re new to a language or framework.</p>
<p>We talked with Kyle Yost, a Software Engineer at CB Insights, who’s been working with Go throughout his career. His team emphasizes testing so they can have confidence in the code they ship. Along the way, Kyle found that Go provides all the tools they need to achieve mocking and accomplish their unit tests.</p>
<p>While third-party solutions were an option, he discovered that Go’s mocking techniques were the best route.</p>
<p>Third-party tools can make things easier, but Kyle didn’t want to sacrifice his knowledge in the process. He found it worthwhile to understand exactly how the team achieves the unit tests. Staying close to what’s happening, rather than farming it out to a third-party, ensured they didn’t sacrifice their knowledge in the process.</p>
<p>To make things easier, he created a resource that categorizes different mocking techniques (including the situations that would lead you to use them).</p>
<p>The techniques below frame the problem in terms of what’s trying to be achieved or the situation that’s faced. Examples are included with each technique.</p>
<p id="5200" data-selectable-paragraph="">5 Mocking Techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li id="5031" data-selectable-paragraph="">Higher-Order Functions</li>
<li id="1400" data-selectable-paragraph="">Monkey Patching</li>
<li id="25d6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Interface Substitution</li>
<li id="97dd" data-selectable-paragraph="">Embedding Interfaces</li>
<li id="aa8d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Mocking out Downstream HTTP Calls with net/http/httptest</li>
</ol>

<p id="2bb2" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Higher-Order Functions</strong></p>
<p id="af53" data-selectable-paragraph="">Use when you need to mock some package level function.</p>
<p id="8f8f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Consider this source code that you want to test. It opens a DB connection to mysql.</p>

<p id="f434" data-selectable-paragraph="">We want to mock out the call to sql.Open. We can make the following change to the source code to pass in a function to open the connection.</p>

<p id="1685" data-selectable-paragraph="">When calling this function in our source code, we can supply the sql.Open function to it:</p>
<p id="1c5d" data-selectable-paragraph="">OpenDB(“myUser”, “myPass”, “localhost”, “foo”, sql.Open)</p>
<p id="a8b3" data-selectable-paragraph="">When we are testing the function, we can supply our own definition of the function in each table test. Here is a complete example with one happy path test and one mock error test:</p>

<p data-selectable-paragraph="">Exercise caution when putting this technique to use. HOFs may be difficult to reason about since you are passing in logic that is not proximal to the function body. You may also expand function parameter lists beyond what is reasonable to read. Also consider that you can end up expanding the list of dependencies for packages that call your function. In the example above, callers of OpenDB(…) now need to import the sql package.</p>
<p id="23b1" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Monkey Patching</strong></p>
<p id="94f2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Use when you need to mock some package level function.</p>
<p id="10eb" data-selectable-paragraph="">This technique is very similar to higher-order functions. We make a package level variable in our source code that points to the real call that we need to mock. Instead of passing in a function to OpenDB(), we just use the variable for the actual call.</p>

<p id="c035" data-selectable-paragraph="">In your test file, you simply reassign the SQLOpen variable in the source code with your mock implementation right before you call the function under test.</p>

<p id="b09d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Sometimes package level variables may not be the best way to write testable code. You may not be able to run tests in parallel without synchronization when many tests are manipulating a single variable. Similarly, if you are writing tests from a test package ( ex: package mypkg_test ), you will need to make this variable public so that your test package can change it. This would also allow other callers of your package to do the same, which is usually not an intended consequence.</p>
<p id="04a6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Use caution with this technique and beware of side effects!</p>
<p id="9961" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Interface Substitution</strong></p>
<p id="6893" data-selectable-paragraph="">Use when you need to mock a method on a concrete type.</p>
<p id="3389" data-selectable-paragraph="">In Go, interfaces are&nbsp;<em>implicitly</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>statically</em>&nbsp;satisfied by implementing types. That means you do not need to explicitly mention that your type will “implement” an interface. If it can do the behaviors of the interface, it is allowed to be treated that way. The static satisfaction means you find out at compile time whether or not your concrete type can be substituted as an interface type. This is one distinguishing mark from true “duck typing” that you see in dynamic languages like python. Because of this, interfaces are incredibly powerful for mocking in tests. The following technique follows the “D” from SOLID design pattern considerations — API boundaries should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.</p>
<p id="f053" data-selectable-paragraph="">Sometimes we need to mock a method defined on a type. The simplest way to do this is to define an interface which describes the behaviors that you need rather than dealing with the concrete type. One example is reading from a file. Maybe we do not want to actually read from a file in our unit test. Consider the code below that opens a file in the main function and then calls another method on the os.File type to read a specified number of bytes and close the file.</p>

<p id="a668" data-selectable-paragraph="">We need to mock out the functionality from the file that is used during ReadContents(…). Specifically, we read from the file with f.Read(data) and we eventually close the file with defer f.Close().</p>
<p id="e2bd" data-selectable-paragraph="">We allow for a mock by accepting interfaces rather than an os.File struct. In the io package in the standard library, there are useful interfaces that we can use:</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><img loading="lazy" src="https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-1.png" alt="" width="842" height="348" srcset="https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-1.png 842w, https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-1-300x124.png 300w, https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-1-150x62.png 150w, https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-1-768x317.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px"></p>
<p id="6830" data-selectable-paragraph="">ReadCloser “embeds” Reader and Closer, meaning that it is satisfied when Reader and Closer are satisfied. More on embedding interfaces in the next technique. We will use io.ReadCloser in our function signature. Note that os.File is still what our source code will supply to the function, and this works even though the call to rc.Read(data) is only using the method that is intended to satisfy io.Reader.</p>

<p id="876a" data-selectable-paragraph="">This follows the pattern to “accept interfaces, return structs” in Go, which allows you to consistently abstract what you need as a caller, rather than a supplier of functionality. An os.File struct is returned from the call to os.Open(), and we may use any of the methods defined on that type. For the specific methods that we need to mock (Read() and Close()) we accept an interface instead of the concrete type in ReadContents(…). In most cases, you may need to create these interfaces yourself, but here we were able to reuse those defined in the io package.</p>
<p id="6e7f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now our test for this function can easily be mocked.</p>

<p data-selectable-paragraph="">Notice that the mockReadCloser struct has fields that dictate what the mock will return. This way, each table test can instantiate the struct with its desired return values.</p>
<p id="0805" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Embedding Interfaces</strong></p>
<p id="d148" data-selectable-paragraph="">Use when you need to mock out a small set of methods defined in a large interface.</p>
<p id="4687" data-selectable-paragraph="">A great example of this situation comes from the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/dynamodb/dynamodbiface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">DynamoDB documentation</a>.</p>
<p id="43a5" data-selectable-paragraph="">When working with the aws-sdk, they provide interfaces for all of their major services that are quite large since they contain all of the calls that can be made for each particular client. Take a look at the dynamodbiface.DynamoDBAPI interface from the link. Rather than pass around the concrete client type, you should pass around this interface to other functions. But then, when testing some of your code that calls one particular function of the interface, how do you mock out that call only without mocking every other function in an attempt to satisfy the interface? Here is the example from the link:</p>
<p id="8717" data-selectable-paragraph="">Source Code:</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><img loading="lazy" src="https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-2.png" alt="" width="845" height="349" srcset="https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-2.png 845w, https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-2-300x124.png 300w, https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-2-150x62.png 150w, https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-2-768x317.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px"></p>
<p id="00fd" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is an incomplete example for simplicity, but notice that myFunc is signed with the dynamodbiface.DynamoDBAPI interface which contains the entire API for DynamoDB. It will use it only for a call to BatchGetItem, so that is what we need to mock.</p>
<p id="aab6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Test:</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><img loading="lazy" src="https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-3.png" alt="" width="848" height="473" srcset="https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-3.png 848w, https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-3-300x167.png 300w, https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-3-150x84.png 150w, https://dmv.myhatchpad.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kyle-Yost-Article-Image-3-768x428.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"></p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">So instead of having to create our own type that satisfies the entire interface, we can simply embed the dynamodbiface.DynamoDBAPI inside our mock struct (to implicitly satisfy the interface contract) and then redefine the function(s) that we care about.</p>
<p id="7690" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Mocking out Downstream HTTP Calls with&nbsp;</strong>net/http/httptest</p>
<p id="fd23" data-selectable-paragraph="">Use when your code under test makes an HTTP call to a downstream service.</p>
<p id="7a93" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is generally understood that unit tests should not connect to external services in order to remain reliable and self-contained. Any one of the previous mocking techniques would suffice for this situation (depending on the construction of your code), but the standard library provides a better way to achieve this. The net/http/httptest package provides a Server type that will listen on your system’s&nbsp;<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/247625/what-is-the-loopback-device-and-how-do-i-use-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">local loopback interface</a>. This is a server completely self-contained within your system’s network, so no external network calls are made, but you can still get the benefit of exercising code that is very similar to the actual calls that your source code will make. To swap out the actual server for a test server during your test, simply parameterize the URL that you will be connecting to, and then call your function under test with the URL of the test server.</p>
<p id="9135" data-selectable-paragraph="">Consider this function, which makes an HTTP call and returns a struct containing the data from the body of the response:</p>

<p id="1de2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Test:</p>

<p data-selectable-paragraph="">Here we let every test case in our test table to create and close a test server with a mocked response. Since the call to httptest.NewServer() takes in an http.Handler, you may decide to just create one test server for all of your test cases, but with different routes, logic, or custom responses.</p>
<p id="edaf" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p id="48fa" data-selectable-paragraph="">Without lecturing on the importance of keeping unit tests reliable and self-contained, this article can hopefully serve as a reference for the many situations you may find yourself in while writing tests in Go. Tests only add value if you have complete confidence in your approach. The main goal of automated testing should be to give you confidence in the code that you are shipping. Any mystery introduced by a third party package works counter to that goal. If other packages are perfectly understood and they make your life easier, then go for it!</p>
<p id="e7bf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Don’t accept that any code is “untestable”, and keep a tight grip on your tests!</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>WebTransport is a new browser API offering low-latency, bidirectional, client-server messaging. If you have not heard about it before I suggest to first read a post called <a href="https://web.dev/quictransport/">Experimenting with QuicTransport</a> published recently on web.dev – it gives a nice overview to WebTransport and shows client-side code examples. Here we will concentrate on implementing server side.</p>
<p>Some key points about WebTransport spec:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebTransport standard will provide a possibility to use streaming client-server communication using modern transports such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3">HTTP/3</a></li>
<li>It can be a good alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket</a> messaging, standard provides some capabilities that are not possible with current WebSocket spec: possibility to get rid of head-of-line blocking problems using individual streams for different data, the possibility to reuse a single connection to a server in different browser tabs</li>
<li>WebTransport also defines an unreliable stream API using UDP datagrams (which is possible since QUIC is UDP-based) – which is what browsers did not have before without a rather complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a> setup involving ICE, STUN, etc. This is sweet for in-browser real-time games.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you figure out things here are links to current WebTransport specs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vvv-webtransport-overview-01">WebTransport overview</a> – this spec gives an overview of WebTransport and provides requirements to transport layer</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vvv-webtransport-quic">WebTransport over QUIC</a> – this spec describes QUIC-based transport for WebTransport</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vvv-webtransport-http3">WebTransport over HTTP/3</a> – this spec describes HTTP/3-based transport for WebTransport (actually HTTP/3 is a protocol defined on top of QUIC)</li>
</ul>
<p>At moment Chrome only implements <a href="https://web.dev/quictransport/#register-for-ot">trial possibility</a> to try out WebTransport standard and only implements WebTransport over QUIC. Developers can initialize transport with code like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>const</span> <span>transport</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>QuicTransport</span><span>(</span><span>'quic-transport://localhost:4433/path'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In case of HTTP/3 transport one will use URL like <code>'https://localhost:4433/path'</code> in transport constructor. All WebTransport underlying transports should support instantiation over URL – that's one of the spec requirements. </p>
<p>I decided that this is a cool possibility to finally play with QUIC protocol and its Go implementation <a href="https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go">github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>Danger</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that all things described in this post are work in progress. WebTransport drafts, Quic-Go library, even QUIC protocol itself are subjects to change. You should not use it in production yet.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://web.dev/quictransport/">Experimenting with QuicTransport</a> post contains links to a <a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/quictransport/client.html">client example</a> and companion <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/blob/gh-pages/quictransport/quic_transport_server.py">Python server implementation</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="client example" src="https://i.imgur.com/Hty00aG.png"></p>
<p>We will use a linked client example to connect to a server that runs on localhost and uses <a href="https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go">github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go</a> library. To make our example work we need to open client example in Chrome, and actually, at this moment we need to install Chrome Canary. The reason behind this is that the  <code>quic-go</code> library supports QUIC draft-29 while Chrome &lt; 85 implements QuicTransport over draft-27. If you read this post at a time when Chrome stable 85 already released then most probably you don't need to install Canary release and just use your stable Chrome.</p>
<p>We also need to generate self-signed certificates since WebTransport only works with a TLS layer, and we should make Chrome trust our certificates. Let's prepare our client environment before writing a server and first install Chrome Canary.</p>
<h2 id="install-chrome-canary">Install Chrome Canary<a href="#install-chrome-canary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/canary/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/canary/</a>, download and install Chrome Canary. We will use it to open <a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/quictransport/client.html">client example</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>If you have Chrome &gt;= 85 then most probably you can skip this step.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="generate-self-signed-tls-certificates">Generate self-signed TLS certificates<a href="#generate-self-signed-tls-certificates" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since WebTransport based on modern network transports like QUIC and HTTP/3 security is a keystone. For our experiment we will create a self-signed TLS certificate using <code>openssl</code>. </p>
<p>Make sure you have <code>openssl</code> installed:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ which openssl
/usr/bin/openssl
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then run:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:x -out server.pass.key <span>2048</span>
openssl rsa -passin pass:x -in server.pass.key -out server.key
rm server.pass.key
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
</code></pre></div>

<p>Set <code>localhost</code> for Common Name when asked.</p>
<p>The self-signed TLS certificate generated from the <code>server.key</code> private key and <code>server.csr</code> files:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days <span>365</span> -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
</code></pre></div>

<p>After these manipulations you should have <code>server.crt</code> and <code>server.key</code> files in your working directory.</p>
<p>To help you with process here is my console output during these steps (click to open):</p>
<details><summary>My console output generating self-signed certificates</summary><div><pre><span></span><code>$ openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:x -out server.pass.key <span>2048</span>

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated

What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank

<h2 id="run-client-example">Run client example<a href="#run-client-example" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now the last step. What we need to do is run Chrome Canary with some flags that will allow it to trust our self-signed certificates. I suppose there is an alternative way making Chrome trust your certificates, but I have not tried it.</p>
<p>First let's find out a fingerprint of our cert:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>openssl x509 -in server.crt -pubkey -noout <span>|</span> openssl pkey -pubin -outform der <span>|</span> openssl dgst -sha256 -binary <span>|</span> openssl enc -base64
</code></pre></div>

<p>In my case base64 fingerprint was <code>pe2P0fQwecKFMc6kz3+Y5MuVwVwEtGXyST5vJeaOO/M=</code>, yours will be different.</p>
<p>Then run Chrome Canary with some additional flags that will make it trust out certs (close other Chrome Canary instances before running it):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ /Applications/Google<span>\ </span>Chrome<span>\ </span>Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google<span>\ </span>Chrome<span>\ </span>Canary <span>\</span>
    --origin-to-force-quic-on<span>=</span>localhost:4433 <span>\</span>
    --ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list<span>=</span>pe2P0fQwecKFMc6kz3+Y5MuVwVwEtGXyST5vJeaOO/M<span>=</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This example is for MacOS, for your system see <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags">docs on how to run Chrome/Chromium with custom flags</a>.</p>
<p>Now you can open <a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/quictransport/client.html">https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/quictransport/client.html</a> URL in started browser and click <code>Connect</code> button. What? Connection not established? OK, this is fine since we need to run our server :)</p>
<h2 id="writing-a-quic-server">Writing a QUIC server<a href="#writing-a-quic-server" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Maybe in future we will have libraries that are specified to work with WebTransport over QUIC or HTTP/3, but for now we should implement server manually. As said above we will use <a href="https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go">github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go</a> library to do this.</p>
<h3 id="server-skeleton">Server skeleton<a href="#server-skeleton" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>First, let's define a simple skeleton for our server:</p>

<p>From Germany come leaks around the performance of the&nbsp;<strong>AMD EPYC MILAN</strong>&nbsp;CPUs, which are expected to be the first CPUs with the&nbsp;<strong>Zen3</strong>&nbsp;microarchitecture&nbsp;to hit the market.&nbsp;As indicated, the&nbsp;<strong>7nm</strong>&nbsp;manufacturing process, the same maximum number of cores (64), the use of DDR4 memory, and the PCI-Express 4.0 interface are maintained.</p>
<p>The novelties are changes in the structure of the Core Compute Die (CCD) and, therefore, of the Core Compute Complex (CCX).&nbsp;Each of the current CCDs consists of two CCX clusters in which the L3 cache is divided into two 16MB caches.&nbsp;With MILAN&nbsp;<strong>this cache will not be divided</strong>, so it comes in the form of a single 32 MB cache.&nbsp;AMD itself had mentioned integrating more than 32 MB in October, so it apparently has not reached more than 32 MB.&nbsp;The number of nuclei is identical to eight per CCD, but the CCX clusters in their former form no longer exist.</p>
<p>The data also provides performance values: these speak of&nbsp;<strong>a +15 percent CPI-related performance increase</strong>&nbsp;for entire workloads.&nbsp;For EPYC processors with up to 32 cores, AMD wants to achieve&nbsp;<strong>a performance increase of +20 percent</strong>&nbsp;compared to ROME processors with Zen2 cores;&nbsp;single thread performance should also increase&nbsp;<strong>by +20 percent</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;For the largest EPYC processors with up to 64 cores, AMD expects a performance increase&nbsp;<strong>of around 10 to 15 percent</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Apparently,&nbsp;<strong>AMD can achieve a higher clock frequency</strong>&nbsp;for processors with fewer cores, so that the increase in performance has a correspondingly greater effect with fewer cores.&nbsp;So far this is not surprising, as it is the expected performance improvement since practically the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>If we want a bigger performance leap, we will have to wait for the&nbsp;<strong>AMD EPYC GENOVA</strong>&nbsp;, where&nbsp;<strong>Zen4 @ 5nm</strong>&nbsp;with TDPs from 120&nbsp;<strong>to 240W</strong>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<strong>DDR5</strong>&nbsp;memory&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>PCI-Express 5.0</strong>&nbsp;interface&nbsp;would come into play&nbsp;, which would arrive at the end of 2021.</p>

<p>The other day I watched “See” on Apple TV+. The premise of the show is that after some apocalyptic event, humanity has lost its sense of sight and all humans are born blind. I quite enjoyed watching it but I can’t say I care much whether it gets extended for another season.</p>

<p>Anyway, one thing they do in the show is tie knots in strings and ropes to communicate. People trace the strings with their fingers, reading them like books. The system is never explained in much detail but people in the show are able to send messages that way. I thought this was a very cool idea and started thinking about how to design a system like that.</p>

<p>Initially, I considered a knot-based morse code with either two types of knots or the presence/absence of one type of knot to represent dots and dashes. Since that would mean up to five knots per letter, however, and I wanted to keep the number of knots as low as possible, I decided to come up with my own encodings of the Latin alphabet. To keep things simple, I used a fixed number of knots per letter.</p>

<p>Given these constraints, I had to decide how many different types of knots my system would be based on. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, the only numbers that make sense are 2, 3 and 6. Two types of knots require five knots per letter, three types require three knots and six types require two.</p>

<p>My last major contact with the world of knots was as a young boy on vacation with my parents at the North Sea coast, learning about knots used on fishing ships. Since I don’t remember much about those knots, I hit google to see what was on offer. Turns out that (like for everything in this world) there is a community of knotters online.</p>

<p>To be suitable for this projects, the knots had to fulfil the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Distinctiveness</strong>: they had to be distinct to the touch so that the “reader” could tell them apart without needing a sense of sight.</li>
  <li><strong>Pull resistance</strong>: I’m sure there’s a term of art for this in professional knot tying. The knots should not come undone when pulling on opposite ends of the string.</li>
  <li><strong>Placability</strong>: choosing a location on the string and placing the knot there should be easy. This is probably true for all knots with sufficient practice but it’s easier for some than for others.</li>
  <li><strong>Locality</strong>: it should be possible to tie the knot without having to pull through one end of the string. Turns out there’s a phrase for this, knots of this kind are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_%28knot%29%23In_the_bight">tied in the bight</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/test-knots2.jpg" alt="test-knots">
<em>Testing different knots. Turns out twisted twine is not ideal for tying knots.</em></p>

<p>After an evening of playing around with different knots, these are the ones I ended up choosing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhand_knot"><strong>Overhand</strong></a>: this is the most fundamental knot and my go-to to tie anything together.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_loop"><strong>Butterfly</strong></a>: this knot creates a nice distinctive loop.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly + 1</strong>: this is what I called a butterfly knot with an additional overhand knot in the loop.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly + 2</strong>: same as above but with two overhand knots.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.101knots.com/barrel-knot.html"><strong>Barrel</strong></a>: this knot creates barrel along the string.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_figure-eight_loop"><strong>Double figure-eight</strong></a>: a knot that forms two loops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Six knots with two knots per character give us 6^2 = 36 possible combinations which is exactly what we need for 26 letters and 10 digits (no spaces or lowercase letters exist in this encoding). One optimisation I made in mapping these combinations to the different letters and digits was to assign each knot a difficulty value (turns out I was pretty off in my guesses of how difficult each knot would be to tie). Each possible combination of two knots then had a combined difficulty equal to the sum of the difficulties of each constituent knot. I assigned the letters in order of frequency such that the most frequent letters would be easiest to tie, the remaining ten combinations I assigned to the ten digits at random. This is the mapping I ended up with:</p>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/mapping.jpg" alt="test-knots">
<em>Mapping knots to letters &amp; digits.</em></p>

<p>Reading about knots online, I discovered that paracord is the medium of choice for people who pursue this hobby. I got some and it is a much more pleasurable experience to tie with compared to the cheap twine I was using before. Another purchase I made was what seems to be the authoritative source on knots: The Ashley Book of Knots. I have only skimmed the book so far but if I ever make a version two of the speaking knots, I’m certain it will be a repository of possible knots to integrate into any future encoding.</p>

<p>After tying a few one letter strings, I eventually tied this seven meter beast:</p>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/human-rights.jpg" alt="human-rights">
<em>“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”</em></p>

<p>After trying out the system, here are some things I learned about the different knots:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Overhand</strong>: the fact that this is not tied in the bight makes this much more annoying to tie than I first thought. I would not include this knot again for this reason.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly</strong>: this knot and its variants are perfectly suited for this project and don’t have any downsides.</li>
  <li><strong>Barrel</strong>: this knot is aesthetically pleasing but not only is it not tied in the bight, it needs three pull-throughs to be completed! There does seem to be a variant of it that doesn’t have this downside but I haven’t played with it yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Double figure-eight</strong>: this knot works but it wastes a lot of string and has a very thick main part that the two loops grow out of. It’s also hard to distinguish from the butterfly by touch alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>I might decide to spend more time on this project in the future but for now, I’m happy with how much fun I’ve already had with it. If I do, these are some ideas for possibly improvements and additions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different knots/different mapping based on what I learned about the knots I chose.</li>
  <li>Some way of preventing the reader to get out of sync with which pairs on the string form the letters. If either the author or the reader of the message accidentally skip one knot, the message ends up garbled. This isn’t a big issue since when that happens, all that’s required is to shift one knot and try again.</li>
  <li>Single knots for common letters or even words to speed up the tying process. This would also help with synchronisation.</li>
  <li>Some way of indicating the direction a string is meant to be read in. Maybe a bead tied into the string. I considered beads also as part of the encoding but decided against it so that no additional material would be needed to write a message.</li>
  <li>Splicing together pieces of string. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_knot">blood knot</a> should make this possible. Since it looks very similar to the barrel knot that’s part of the current encoding, I would probably have to choose between the two. This could indicate a space. Assembling longer messages from multiple pieces of string would also somewhat solve the problem of having to tie knots that are not died in the bight in long pieces of string.</li>
  <li>The distance between two knots could be integrated into the encoding and assigned some significance.</li>
  <li>Maybe some completely different way of encoding meaning that isn’t based on the Latin alphabet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand">Shorthand</a> could be a possible source of inspiration for a writing system that is designed for speed. Googling for similar ideas, I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu">Quipu</a> system used by the Inca people. I couldn’t find much about how specifically it worked and maybe that knowledge isn’t extant but it would be cool to learn more about it.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the beginning of this year, I joined <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" target="_blank"><strong>On Deck</strong></a> – a fellowship of entrepreneurs at various stages of launching their startups – with the goal of expanding my professional network in the Bay Area and finding a co-founder for my next venture.</p><p>‍</p><p>On Deck was designed as a 10-week onsite program, with social events such as weekend trips, lunches, etc. However, no one had anticipated a global pandemic to strike, and On Deck had to switch to fully remote operations even before the group had a chance to meet in person.</p><p>‍</p><p>The decision to continue as a remote program came a few weeks before the cohort start date. By then, I have already flown into San Francisco, rented a place, and was testing several startup ideas. As such, the announcement was a huge blow to me, and I was disheartened to learn that the sessions would be conducted online. All the dinners, parties and team bonding activities I was looking forward to have been replaced with Slack chats and Zoom calls.</p><p>‍</p><p>In retrospect, it is incredible how quickly On Deck managed to reorganize the entire curriculum into a fully-remote event. Kudos to their swift response and hard work in making On Deck 2020 possible! If they had cancelled the cohort, I would not have met all the amazing people and my co-founder.</p><p>‍</p><h3>So how did it all play out?</h3><p>The first day started with a 4-hour virtual kickoff session. We were split into groups and played icebreaker games. Through introductions, games, and breakout activities, we got to know everyone in the cohort.</p><p>‍</p><p>Without us knowing at the time, our groups were not random. On Deck evaluated the participants and thoughtfully paired those with complementary skills together. Therefore, it was not entirely coincidental that the first person I spoke to that day became my co-founder (months later). Job well done On Deck!</p><p>‍</p><p>What followed was 10 weeks of diverse activities:</p><ul role="list"><li>Breakout sessions</li><li>Hackathons</li><li>Speed dating</li><li>1:1 meetings</li><li>Virtual dinners</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>The breakout sessions were a dream come true – imagine the cool founders you follow on Twitter all appearing in your calendar: <a href="https://twitter.com/julialipton" target="_blank"><strong>Julia Lipton</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover" target="_blank"><strong>Ryan Hoover</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vhmth" target="_blank"><strong>Vinay Hiremath</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/andreasklinger" target="_blank"><strong>Andreas Klinger</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33" target="_blank"><strong>Elizabeth Yin</strong></a>, and so on. You are free to select topics that are relevant or of interest to you to attend. Each session has around 10 participants, so there are ample opportunities to ask questions and interact with the speaker.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img alt="Snack was built for an ODF hackathon." src="https://assets.website-files.com/5df35853014f242fc4ae89f1/5f47e314a1a0eae8151bf231_snack-call.jpeg"></p><figcaption>(Snack was built for an ODF hackathon)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Meanwhile, hackathons allowed groups to work together and demonstrate their strengths. It was during one of these hackathons that I built <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Snack</strong></a>. On Deck were the first adopters and their feedback shaped the product today. At this point in time, I already had several conversations with my future co-founder on starting a business together. I look up to him &amp; like what he is working on, and him seeing me build a hackathon project that grew to be used by hundreds of Slack organizations is what sealed the deal.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Today</h3><p>My co-founder (<a href="https://twitter.com/_BenHQ" target="_blank"><strong>Ben</strong></a>) and I are building a <a href="https://contra.com/" target="_blank"><strong>professional network</strong></a> for people you actually work with. Meanwhile, <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/team" target="_blank"><strong>Tracy</strong></a> has taken over the day-to-day Snack operations of providing serendipity-as-a-service to teams.</p><p>‍</p><p>Joining <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" target="_blank"><strong>On Deck</strong></a> is undoubtedly one of the best moves I have pursued. Never have I thought a virtual program could be this engaging and inspiring. In fact, the 10 weeks with On Deck were some of the most sociable weeks in my professional life, and the sense of community continues to be felt to this day.</p><p>‍</p><p>On Deck did an excellent job creating what felt like serendipity, but is actually a diligently orchestrated event with hand-picked individuals that form a supportive community of shared goals and deep subject expertise. I am excited to share the magic that I felt during O nDeck with you through <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Snack</strong></a>. ❤️</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="4cd9">When you are building Kubernetes applications, itâ€™s easy to end up in with â€œauthentication sprawlâ€� where all of your services have different authentication mechanisms. This tutorial walks through how to centralize your authentication mechanisms using an IdP and an API gateway.</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://blog.getambassador.io/@alex_gervais?source=post_page-----d509ffbc7b6f----------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Alex Gervais" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*qrt6AVoODoXwvJUGbeuv0w.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p id="dcd5"><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak</a> is a widely adopted Identity and Access Management (<a href="https://www.getambassador.io/learn/kubernetes-glossary/iam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IAM for short</a>) open-source solution. 2014 was a big year for groundbreaking technologies as both the Keycloak and Kubernetes projects were initially released a few weeks apart. Unsurprisingly, many Kubernetes end-users are turning to Keycloak as the preferred way to manage access to the secure APIs and services of their platform.</p><p id="3311">Simply running Keycloak in Kubernetes wonâ€™t however make your platform secure. A lot of concerns are left to the user to configure and implement: from exposing the Keycloak API endpoints using TLS and an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingress-controller</a>, to enforcing security policies on specific business endpoints. When solving these problems, we have a bias towards using an API Gateway solution to handle encrypted connections and centralize API management policies instead of re-implementing authentication strategies in every language and application of your microservice architecture.</p><p id="a6b3">Our goal today will be to install Keycloak as our IAM solution and secure it behind the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Edge Stack</a>, our API Gateway acting as a Kubernetes ingress controller. As a final step, we will deploy a sample application and demonstrate how to use Keycloak as an Identity provider (<a href="https://www.getambassador.io/learn/kubernetes-glossary/idp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IdP for short</a>) to restrict access to this application with OAuth2 using request Filters.</p><p id="0895">In this tutorial, we will use a non-production-ready Keycloak installation. To simplify our dependency graph, weâ€™ll use the in-memory datastore, which is totally suitable for a demo but wouldnâ€™t guarantee high-availability in a production environment. If you are looking for production-grade persistence, <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/index.html#_database" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak offers a variety of storage solutions</a>.</p><p id="eedf">The ingress controller is the missing building block in most Kubernetes offerings. Although Kubernetes defines an Ingress resource, it is not actually backed by any implementation that will turn the resource into a public service! The choice and installation of an ingress solution are left to the operator. Here, we will use the community version of the Ambassador Edge Stack, because of its direct integration with Keycloak for authentication, to expose and secure public traffic coming in from internet requests to downstream private services running in our Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="c455">At the end of the tutorial, weâ€™ll be up and running with the Ambassador Edge Stack doing TLS termination at the edge of the Kubernetes network, exposing our Keycloak installation under <code>/auth/</code> and securing our Quote application under <code>/backend/</code>.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1496/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png" width="748" height="520" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="4461">Scaffolding with the K8s Initializer</h2><p id="0bfb">Kubernetes is often made fun of because of the copious amounts of YAML required. Instead of going into a scavenger hunt for YAML samples and assembling all puzzle pieces together from stale sources, weâ€™ll be using the <a href="https://app.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K8s Initializer</a> to generate all of the Kubernetes resources for us. The K8s Initializer is a project generator tool similar to what exists for application developers: think Spring Initializr or Yeoman.</p><p id="0d5d">The wizard-like interface of the K8s Initializer will guide us through a few questions to understand and configure specific settings that vary from one cloud provider to the other. These implementation details are often where promises are broken and portability falls short, making it hard to configure ingress controllers and expose services to public traffic. Hopefully, we can do away with the little gotchas by using a comprehensive tool like the K8s Initializer who will provide us with an optimal configuration.</p><p id="b086">Specifically for this tutorial, we picked our target Kubernetes cluster: â€œGoogle Kubernetes Engineâ€� with a â€œGoogle External Load Balancer (L4)â€� load balancer. We also chose a public Hostname for our installation. Using a public hostname will require an extra step to configure a DNS entry to point to our installation, but given we want to demonstrate how to build a public secure application stack, itâ€™s worth the extra effort. As for the K8s Initializerâ€™s Auth configuration, we undoubtedly selected Keycloak, with a temporary password.</p><p id="8d03">Once satisfied with our K8s Initializer options, we hit the â€œdownloadâ€� button. Weâ€™ll be given a set of ready-to-go YAML files and instructions.</p><p id="21d8">Give it a try! <a href="https://app.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://app.getambassador.io/</a></p><h2 id="56e8">Installing the Ambassador Edge Stack</h2><p id="fad2">Weâ€™ll start by installing the Ambassador Edge Stack simply because it contains a bunch of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions</a> dependencies. Given you have access to your desired Kubernetes cluster, the installation will be as simple as running <code>kubectl apply</code> commands and configuring a DNS entry to point to the external IP of the provisioned service.</p><h2 id="d5bb">Installing Keycloak</h2><p id="4d13">Installing Keycloak from the generated YAML is again straightforward: a single <code>kubectl apply</code> command. One curious cat might peek at the Keycloak YAML file, donâ€™t worry it wonâ€™t kill you! Youâ€™ll actually be able to appreciate how the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/using/intro-mappings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Mapping</a> resource will instruct traffic hitting the public <code>/auth/</code> prefix endpoint to be forwarded to our private Keycloak pod running in our Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="f8e2">Giving Keycloak a few minutes to start, weâ€™ll then be able to access itâ€™s UI at <a href="https://domain-name/auth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://domain-name/auth/</a>. Since we chose to let â€œ<em>Ambassador terminate TLS using a Letâ€™s Encrypt certificateâ€�</em> in the K8s Initializer options, we can appreciate how automatic TLS termination is happening with a secure certificate for our Keycloak installation.</p><p id="e690">We can then log in to Keycloakâ€™s Administration Console UI using the default <code>admin</code> username and the temporary password weâ€™ve selected previously to configure Keycloak to our needsâ€¦ and change the password!</p><h2 id="befa">Configuring a Keycloak Realm, Client and User</h2><p id="a442">To secure our APIs, we will be using our shiny new Keycloak installation as our IdP. We first need to create a client to handle authentication requests from Ambassador Edge Stack. All of these configuration steps can be achieved using the Keycloak UI.</p><ol><li id="06c0">We first start by creating a new â€œRealmâ€�. Hovering on top of the â€œMasterâ€� label in the right-hand navigation, we can click on â€œAdd realmâ€�. We picked <code>ambassador</code> as the â€œNameâ€� of our new realm. This will be needed later on to configure the <code>authorizationURL</code> field in the auth Filter.</li><li id="6e10">Weâ€™ll create a new client by navigating to â€œClientsâ€� and clicking â€œCreateâ€�. We chose the following settings: <br>- <em>Client ID</em>: <code>ambassador</code> â€” This value will be used in the <code>clientID</code> field of the auth Filter.<br>- <em>Client Protocol</em>: <code>openid-connect</code><br>- <em>Root URL</em>: None, left blank</li><li id="5859">On the following screen, we configured the Client with:<br>- <em>Access Type</em>: <code>confidential</code><br>- <em>Valid Redirect URIs</em>: <code>*</code></li><li id="2392">Navigating to the â€œMappersâ€� tab in our Client, we clicked â€œCreateâ€� and used the following settings:<br>- <em>Protocol</em>: <code>openid-connect</code><br>- <em>Name</em>: <code>Ambassador Mapper</code><br>- <em>Mapper Type</em>: <code>Audience</code><br>- <em>Included Client Audience</em>: Select the name of the Client from the dropdown. Remember, we named our Client <code>ambassador</code>.</li><li id="cde8">Going back to our <code>ambassador</code> Client, we navigated to the â€œClient Scopesâ€� section and configured our Client for <code>offline_access</code>.</li><li id="6c77">Back again to our <code>ambassador</code> Client, we then navigated to the â€œCredentialsâ€� section. We took note of the â€œSecretâ€� value as it will be used later when configuring our auth Filter.</li></ol><p id="aeec">Along with our Client configuration, letâ€™s configure a Keycloak â€œUserâ€�:</p><ol><li id="2481">Navigating to the â€œUsersâ€� section of the Keycloak Administration Console, we will click on â€œAdd userâ€�. We gave our user a simple username: <code>my-keycloak-user</code>, then clicked â€œSaveâ€�.</li><li id="c77c">On the following screen, we switched to the Userâ€™s â€œCredentialsâ€� tab to set a temporary password.</li></ol><p id="b25e">Now that we have a user with which we are able to authenticate ourselves with, letâ€™s deploy an application.</p><h2 id="49f6">Deploying a Quote service</h2><p id="902c">Deploying custom applications on Kubernetes is achieved by creating some Kubernetes resources defined asâ€¦ You guessed it, more YAML! This time, since we are deploying a sample backend application, the sample is somewhat lightweight. You can save the following definitions to a â€œquote-service.yamlâ€� file and deploy it using <code>kubectl apply -f quote-service.yaml</code>.</p><pre><span id="4f23">---<br>apiVersion: v1<br>kind: Service<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  ports:<br>  - name: http<br>    port: 80<br>    targetPort: 8080<br>  selector:<br>    app: quote<br>---<br>apiVersion: apps/v1<br>kind: Deployment<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  replicas: 1<br>  selector:<br>    matchLabels:<br>      app: quote<br>  strategy:<br>    type: RollingUpdate<br>  template:<br>    metadata:<br>      labels:<br>        app: quote<br>    spec:<br>      containers:<br>      - name: backend<br>        image: docker.io/datawire/quote:0.4.1<br>        ports:<br>        - name: http<br>          containerPort: 8080<br>---<br>apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2<br>kind: Mapping<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote-backend<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  prefix: /backend/<br>  service: quote</span></pre><p id="c66d">This will create a Kubernetes <code>Deployment</code>, <code>Service</code>, and <code>Mapping</code> to publicly expose our running Quote application under the <code>/backend/</code> path. Give it a try, itâ€™s currently unprotected: <a href="https://domain-name/backend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://domain-name/backend/</a>.</p><h2 id="dbb3">Securing access</h2><p id="1525">Building on the configurations we applied to our Keycloak installation in the â€œConfiguring a Keycloak Realm, Client and Userâ€� section earlier, weâ€™ll be creating an OAuth2 <code>Filter</code> and <code>FilterPolicy</code> resources in Kubernetes. Donâ€™t forget to replace the placeholders in this YAML sample with the values from your installation!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Alongside the slew of new features added in iOS 13 was a small
(but delightful!) one: when cropping an image in the screenshot preview window, the crop boundaries
would now subtly snap to certain elements in the image:</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}">
<source src="https://bryce.co/screenshot-cropping/settings-crop-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/webm"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/ogg"></video><p>There was some speculation around how this feature worked — common guesses on a few sites
included edge detection, machine learning, or just… something simpler.</p><p>Turns out, it's that last one! Shoutout to
<a href="https://twitter.com/rydermackay/">Ryder Mackay</a>
for owning the only real
<a href="https://twitter.com/rydermackay/status/1219341583251918849">google result</a>
for <code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code>&nbsp;— the class that handles this logic, and the focus
of this post.</p><p>We'll look at how the metadata harvester works, how to feed extra data to it, and how to completely
break this form of screenshot cropping.</p><blockquote><p>Note: Like so many things on this site, this is much more of a curiosity than
something you should actually do in a production app, especially given how awkward
the implementation is. If you did want to leverage Apple
internals — why waste it on something like this?
<a href="https://bryce.co/recreating-imessage-confetti/">Add some confetti</a> or something instead.</p></blockquote><p><code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code> (pronounced “ssssscreenshot-metadata-harvester”, as far as I'm concerned),
is the primary class responsible for collecting screenshot information from your app.</p><p>When a screenshot is taken,
<code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code> will work with your app to generate a full-page PDF-based screenshot
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreenshotservicedelegate">if you provide one</a>, but otherwise,
it will simply collect two pieces of metadata: the current <code>NSUserActivity</code>'s title, and the bounds of
any “important views” that are present on the screen.</p><p>You can easily see this bounds-collection system in action using <code>lldb</code>. First, set a breakpoint
on <code>_contentRectsForMetadata</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>b</span> <span>+</span><span>[</span><span>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</span> <span>_contentRectsForMetadata</span><span>]</span>
<span>Breakpoint</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>no</span> <span>locations</span> <span>(</span><span>pending</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>
<span>WARNING</span><span>:</span>  <span>Unable</span> <span>to</span> <span>resolve</span> <span>breakpoint</span> <span>to</span> <span>any</span> <span>actual</span> <span>locations</span><span>.</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that the breakpoint wasn't able to resolve to an actual address —
that's because <code>ScreenshotServices.framework</code> is loaded dynamically, and (in my case)
I haven't taken a screenshot yet. But <code>lldb</code> will resolve the correct location
as soon as the framework is loaded later anyways.</p><p>Next, we'll take a screenshot, and execution will pause.
We can then step out of <code>_contentRectsForMetadata</code> and inspect the
return value in register <code>x0</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// Breakpoint triggered in `_contentRectsForMetadata`:

<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And there we have it! That array contains the rects that our screenshots will snap to
when cropping.</p><p>The views we're collecting bounds from belong to two categories:</p><ol><li>The root view of any view controllers that are currently added to the hierarchy</li><li>If visible, the frame of the on-screen keyboard (sometimes)</li></ol><p>The second category here is somewhat interesting — the keyboard's frame is based on
a call to <code>+[UIPeripheralHost visiblePeripheralFrame]</code>, which doesn't account for
the iPad's floating or split keyboard modes.</p><p>We're not here to talk about keyboards though, so let's look at the more interesting
side of the metadata: view controllers’ view bounds.</p><h4 id="view-controller-traversal">View Controller Traversal</h4><p>The algorithm for finding each view frame traverses the view
controller hierarchy by looking at each view controller's child
view controllers and presented view controller (if any).</p><p>For each of these, the bounds of the view controller's root view
is taken, minus any safe area insets; the bounds are then converted
to the window's coordinate space and appended to a list.</p><p>The resulting algorithm looks something like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>/*</span><span>*</span><span>

</code></pre></div><p>So in a nutshell, view controllers are really what drives the snap areas here.</p><h4 id="-not--abusing-ios-screenshot-cropping-mechanism"><em>Not</em> Abusing iOS’ Screenshot Cropping Mechanism</h4><p>To start with, given that view controllers determine snap areas, it's worth
pointing out that strategic use of child view controllers can actually get you
nicer snap areas somewhat naturally.</p><p>You can even take this to some extremes, like making collection view cell contents
backed by their own view controllers, as discussed in
<a href="https://twitter.com/khanlou">Soroush Khanlou</a>‘s
<a href="https://khanlou.com/2015/04/view-controllers-in-cells/">original article</a>, or
<a href="https://twitter.com/wibosco">William Boles</a>’
<a href="https://williamboles.me/hosting-viewcontrollers-in-cells/">excellent follow-up</a>.
In fact, William's demo project acts as a great example of this behavior:</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}">
<source src="https://bryce.co/screenshot-cropping/collectionview-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/webm"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/ogg"></video><p>I wouldn't advocate for structuring your app any differently just
for the minor benefit of nicer cropping for screenshots — especially
something as involved as view controllers within cells.</p><p>But, if you find yourself in a scenario where you're deciding whether or
not to use child view controllers in a given situation — keep in mind that
this is one interesting advantage, however small!</p><h4 id="defining-arbitrary-snap-areas">Defining Arbitrary Snap Areas</h4><p>There are two options for modifying the screenshot snap areas,
both of which are a bit terrible.</p><p>The first option is to simply add empty child view controllers
defining the areas you're interested in. By manipulating
the view controller's root view bounds and safe area insets, you can add
arbitrary snap areas. You don't even need to add the view to the parent's
view hierarchy —&nbsp;only a call to <code>-[UIViewController addChildViewController:]</code> is
needed.</p><p>However, this is… questionable at best. In my case, I'd much rather
just swizzle. The setup is made a bit more complex due to us not being able
to use a category (since the class isn't available at link or launch time),
and due to it being a class method.</p><p>There are a few ways around this, like forcing a dependency on
<code>ScreenshotServices.framework</code>, but this all-in-code setup is the cleanest I've come up with:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// Holds the original implementation of

to modify the screenshot cropping system even more.</p><h4 id="building-stronger-snaps">Building Stronger Snaps</h4><p>There's a fun consequence of the snapping implementation in that, if multiple snap areas
are in close proximity, they'll essentially merge together.</p><p>More concretely, once the cropping tool has snapped to one rect, it will
continue snapping to rects further along in the returned values array.</p><p>This means order matters; if we return snapping rects
with <code>origin.x</code> values of…</p><div><pre><code data-lang="plain">origin.x = 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
</code></pre></div><p>… then cropping to anywhere near the 10-14 range will result in a snap to <code>14</code>.
But if we reverse the rect order…</p><div><pre><code data-lang="plain">origin.x = 14, 13, 12, 11, 10
</code></pre></div><p>… then we will snap to <code>10</code> instead!</p><p>We can also add rects approaching from both directions to hone in on an area from either side.
This gives us the ability to inflate the snap distance from the default
(of only a few points) to any arbitrarily large margin:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// In `swizzled_contentRectsForMetadata`...

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Firefox 80 and my confusion over its hardware accelerated video on Linux</h2>

	<p><small>August 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The news of the time interval is that Firefox 80 is out and in
theory it can support hardware video acceleration on X11, not just
Wayland (<a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/08/firefox-80-release-linux-gpu-acceleration">source</a>,
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Firefox-80-Released">also</a>).
The master Mozilla tracking bug for hardware accelerated video on
X11 is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619523">bug #1619523</a>, with all
sorts of information. So I downloaded the official release (one of
my Firefox setups uses the official builds these days for reasons
beyond the scope of this entry) and tried to get it to do accelerated
video playback. The short version is that I think I've failed, but I'm
not sure why.</p>

<p>Even in Firefox 80, getting VA-API accelerated video playback
requires a whole series of magic incantations in <code>about:config</code>
preferences and perhaps environment variables when you start Firefox
(this may change in the next release). Assuming that all of those
are set right, Firefox can apparently still decide that it doesn't
like your Linux video driver (or its version), your specific hardware,
or perhaps either or both of the resolution of the source video and
the resolution of your display. Some or many of these can be forced
with Firefox settings, but at the same time the bug reports I've
read say that sometimes Firefox ignores hardware acceleration because
it's slower for the specific circumstances, or because it has known
bugs. If Firefox is making a sensible decision for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/HomeMachine2018">my specific
hardware</a>, that's one thing and I want
it to do what will work best. But if I've missed a setting or if
Firefox is just being twitchy about something, I also want to
override it. In general I know my hardware is capable of hardware
accelerated playback of videos at far lower CPU usage than Firefox
manages (on the same videos).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Firefox won't tell me what it's doing or why, at
least not in a way that I can understand. I've peered into the
depths of <code>about:support</code>, which tells me some of the 'what' but
not the 'why', and I've tried some of the things from <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619523">bug #1619523</a>
without success. If Firefox is or isn't going to do hardware
accelerated video playback, I wish it would tell me both what it was
doing and why. Otherwise I'm probably going to go on being confused
and annoyed with it.</p>

<p>(I care about hardware acceleration not just because of CPU load
but because my perception is that hardware acceleration is necessary
to play back a full sized video smoothly without dropping frames
every so often. This may be wrong on modern hardware, even on my 4k
display.)</p>

				<p> &gt;&gt;&gt; What is Pointer?</p>
				<p> Pointer is a reading club for developers. It's a window into what other current and future CTOs are reading and thinking about. Super high quality engineering-related content, not just trendy topics or link bait.</p>
			</div>	
			
			<div>
				<p> &gt;&gt;&gt; What kind of content belongs in Pointer?</p>
				<p> Anything worth reading. It can be language-specific or framework-agnostic, or not even strictly technical as long as it's relevant to a developer. Folks have shared interesting open source projects, a blog post on engineering cultural anti-patterns, and even an academic CS paper from 1982 about why counting starts with 0.</p>

<p><strong>By Chris Hedges</strong> / Original to Scheerpost</p>



<p>The persecution of the attorney Steven Donziger is a grim illustration of what happens when we confront the real centers of power, masked and unacknowledged by the divisive cant from the Trump White House or the sentimental drivel of the Democratic Party. Those, like Donziger, who name and fight the corporate control of our society on behalf of the vulnerable see the judiciary, the press and the institutions of government unite to crucify them.</p>



<p>“It’s been a long battle, 27 years,” Donziger said when I reached him by phone in his apartment in Manhattan.</p>



<p>Donziger, who has been fighting polluting American oil companies for nearly three decades on behalf of indigenous communities and peasant farmers in Ecuador, has been under house arrest in Manhattan for a year.&nbsp;He will go to trial in federal court in New York on September 9 on contempt of court charges, which could see him jailed for six months.&nbsp;Ever&nbsp;since he won a multibillion-dollar judgment in 2011 against the oil giant Chevron, the multinational has come after him personally through litigation that threatens to destroy him economically, professionally and personally.</p>



<p>“Our L-T [long-term] strategy is to demonize Donziger,” Chevron wrote in an internal memo in 2009, as reviewed<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/when-feds-demur-judge-charges-ecuador-crusader-himself/" target="_blank"> by Courthouse News</a>.</p>

<p>“It started when Texaco went into Ecuador in the Amazon in the 1960s and cut a sweetheart deal with the military government then ruling Ecuador,” Donziger told me. “Over the next 25 years, Texaco was the exclusive operator of a very large area of the Amazon that had several oil fields within this area, 1500 square miles. They drilled hundreds of wells. They created thousands of open-air, unlined toxic waste pits where they dumped the heavy metals and toxins that came up from the ground when they drilled. They ran pipes from the pits into rivers and streams that local people relied on for their drinking water, their fishing and their sustenance. They poisoned this pristine ecosystem, in which lived five indigenous peoples, as well as a lot of other nonindigenous rural communities. There was a mass industrial poisoning.”</p>



<p>“By the time I went down there in the early 1990s, many people had died, cancer rates were skyrocketing according to several independent health evaluations, people were really hurting. There was zero regard for the lives of the local people by Texaco. I was a very young lawyer back in 1993 when I first went to Ecuador. It was like looking at an apocalyptic scene. There was oil on the roads. People were living in abject poverty. They had no shoes. They would get oil on their feet when they walked along the roads. The oil pollution had permeated every aspect of daily life. It was in the food supply. It was in the water supply. It was in the air. The average person there would get exposed multiple times a day to very harmful, cancer-causing toxins, with foreseeable results.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I, with other lawyers, filed a lawsuit in New York against Texaco. The reason we filed in New York was because Texaco’s headquarters were in New York in 1993. The decisions to pollute in Ecuador, to play God to the people of Ecuador, were made in New York. We sued in New York. Texaco tried to get the case back to Ecuador where they had never been held accountable, where they knew the indigenous peoples had no money or resources to find lawyers.”</p>



<p>“They thought it would just go away,” said Donziger. “Over a 10-year period, we battled to get a jury trial in the United States. Ultimately, they won that part of the battle. It went down to Ecuador.”</p>



<p>“We started working with a team of Ecuadoran lawyers in the early 2000s. We went forward with the lawsuit. We produced voluminous scientific and testimonial evidence, showing that they caused probably the world’s worst oil pollution. It was called the ‘Amazon Chernobyl’ by locals and experts. They dumped 16 billion gallons of toxic waste. They did it deliberately to save money. This was unlike the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which was a terrible accident, even though it was a product of horrendous negligence by BP. This was done by design to pollute, knowing that people would die, and that indigenous groups would be decimated, and that this beautiful part of the Amazon would be destroyed.”</p>



<p>The refusal to abide by even minimal environmental regulations saved Texaco an estimated $3 on every barrel of oil produced over 26 years (1964-1992), <a href="https://amazonwatch.org/news/2019/0625-chevrons-corrupt-legal-practices-called-out-by-leading-human-rights-and-environmental-ngos">according to Amazon Watch</a>, or an estimated extra $5 billion in revenue. The hundreds of waste pits the company eventually abandoned in Ecuador, on average, contain 200 times the contamination allowed by typical global standards.</p>



<p>“They tried to grind us down using classic corporate defense tactics,” Donziger said of the legal war. “They filed thousands of motions. We stood strong. We had a great legal team of Ecuadorian lawyers.”</p>



<p>In the end, they won a stunning victory, a rare moment of accountability for first-world conglomerates who rape the environment of developing nations by exploiting weak, corrupt governments.</p>



<p>“The verdict came down, about $18 billion in favor of the affected communities, which is what it would take at a minimum to clean up the actual damage and compensate the people for some of their injuries. That eventually got reduced on appeal in Ecuador to $9.5 billion, but it was affirmed by three appellate courts, including the highest court of Ecuador. It was <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/ecuadorians-can-sue-chevron-in-canada-supreme-court-rules/">affirmed by the Canadian Supreme Court</a>, where the Ecuadorians went to enforce their judgment in a unanimous opinion in 2015.”</p>



<p>Chevron, as the evidence mounted against it, sold their assets in Ecuador and left the country. The corporation threatened the plaintiffs with <a href="https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-calls-for-dismissal-of-ecuador-lawsuit">a “lifetime of litigation”</a> if they attempted to collect, and, according to internal Chevron memos, launched a legal and media campaign that has cost an estimated $2 billion to prevent payment of the settlement and to demonize and destroy Donziger.</p>

<p>Donziger came to his epic battle against Chevron through journalism. “I was a journalist on my college newspaper,” he said of his time as a history major at American University. “My first job out of college was as a journalist with [United Press International]. I worked for UPI in Washington. They were strong in Latin America. I traveled to Managua in 1983 or 1984, I don’t remember exactly, and found work in the UPI bureau. I was 23 years old. I worked in the UPI bureau in Managua during the Sandinista era.”</p>



<p>He left UPI after a year in Managua but stayed on in Nicaragua to work as a freelance journalist for newspapers such as <em>The Fort Lauderdale News, The Toronto Star</em> and <em>The Atlanta Constitution</em>. He spent about three years as a reporter before going to Harvard Law School. When he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, he worked as a public defender in Washington, D.C. He documented Iraqi civilian casualties in Iraq following the first Gulf War that became a report adopted by the United Nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A classmate at law school was from Ecuador. His classmate’s father organized a trip in April 1993 for lawyers and medical professionals to look at the contamination caused by the oil extraction in the Amazon. That trip, which Donziger joined, spawned the suit against Texaco. He would make more than 250 trips to Ecuador over the next two decades.</p>



<p>“Journalism significantly shaped my views and skill set,” he said. “It was vital to allowing my work to be successful. From the beginning this was a unique litigation, for many reasons, but one of the reasons was we, as a team, decided to work across multiple platforms. If we only saw this case as a lawsuit we would never win.”</p>



<p>“Chevron controlled the legal system in Ecuador with their influence. We needed to operate across different platforms, including engaging with the media and carrying out significant public education. Most Ecuadoreans, other than those who lived in the region, knew nothing about the pollution that had been happening in their country. We carried out zealous advocacy in the public arena. We realized that the indigenous people would never get a fair trial in Ecuador if they did not illuminate what had happened to them and get public support.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The fact that I am detained shows how far we’ve come and how much risk Chevron feels. It’s not a sign we lost. It’s the opposite.”</p><cite>Steven Donziger</cite></blockquote>



<p>Both the judge who oversaw its lawsuit against Donziger for “racketeering” and Chevron itself “claim that this type of activity is wrong,” he said. “The irony is that what we were doing is what the big oil companies have always done. They always operate in the public relations domain, lobbying Congress to pass legislation to extinguish various legal claims, meeting political leaders …</p></div></div>

              <p>I don’t know you very well, but I’m guessing you want more users for your application. Registration is a major part of the initial user experience. As an application developer, you need to balance getting the information you need with making it easy for a new user to get started.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>FusionAuth is an auth system, but it also provides user management, registration and more. With FusionAuth, you can build custom registration forms to capture the information you need. In this blog post, you’ll build a self service registration form for a (fake) real estate application. When the user registers, they’ll see two steps, one for basic account information and the other to capture additional information about their home buying needs.</p>

<p>If you follow this tutorial, you’ll end up with a form that asks a new user for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Email</li>
  <li>Password</li>
  <li>First name</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
  <li>Geographic area where they are looking</li>
  <li>Minimum house price</li>
  <li>Maximum house price</li>
</ul>

<p>Because this is a lot of information to ask for at once, you’ll break this up into two pages. We’ll be walking through this using the administrative user interface, but everything can be done via <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/forms">the APIs</a>, should you need to manage registration forms programmatically.</p>

<h2 id="fusionauth-setup">FusionAuth setup</h2>

<p>If you don’t have FusionAuth running, <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide">get it going in 5 minutes</a>.</p>

<p>Then get a license key and activate it. <em>Please note that advanced registration forms are a paid edition feature. You can <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing">learn more about paid editions and sign up for a free trial here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Next, <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/reactor">activate your license</a>. Whew, all the FusionAuth set up is done.</p>

<h2 id="create-form-fields">Create form fields</h2>

<p>Now you need to create custom form fields. To do so, navigate to “Customizations” and then “Form fields” after logging into the administrative user interface. You’ll see some form fields are already there. These are the default fields available for your registration forms:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/advanced-registration-forms/predefined-keys.png" alt="A list of the predefined form fields that you can use for registration."></p>

<p>You can mix and match these form fields on a new form. If that’s all you need, you can avoid creating custom form fields. But if you need anything new, you’ll want to create a new form field.</p>

<h3 id="custom-form-fields">Custom form fields</h3>

<p>The real power of registration form building can be seen when you add custom fields. You can add as many of these as you’d like.</p>

<p>You can store values in any of the predefined user fields such as <code>user.fullName</code>. But you can also use the <code>data</code> field on both the <code>registration</code> and the <code>user</code> objects to store arbitrary data.</p>

<p><code>registration.data</code> is the right place to store data related to a user’s account that is specific to an application. As a reminder, <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/registrations">a registration</a> is a link between a user and an application.</p>

<p>Since this is a real estate app, the minimum price point of the user is <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/germane">germane</a> to this application. Storing it on the registration is the right approach. If you were later to build a mortgage application using FusionAuth as its auth layer, there’d be different fields, such as loan amount, associated with that registration.</p>

<p>You can also create custom fields tied to the user alone. If you wanted to ask for information that multiple applications would use, such as a current mailing address, that would be best stored in the <code>user.data</code> field.</p>

<p>Let’s add a couple fields to your sign up form.</p>

<p>First, add a minimum price. Configure the form field to have a data type of <code>number</code> and a <code>text</code> form control. The user’s minimum price point is useful information, so let’s make it required. This means a new user can’t complete registration without providing a value. Here’s what it will look like before we save the configuration:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/advanced-registration-forms/form-field-min-price-required.png" alt="Adding the minimum price field."></p>

<p>Beyond configuring a form field to be required, you can also ensure that a field matches a regular expression or a confirmation field. The latter may be useful if you are asking for sensitive data that you want to double check that the user provides correctly.</p>

<p>Let’s also add a maximum price field and use the same settings. Use a key of <code>maxprice</code>; keys must be unique within the registration. It’ll have a different name as well, but the other settings should be the same as the <code>minprice</code> field created first.</p>

<p>Finally, add a geographic search area. This lets new users share where they are looking to buy. It’ll be a string, but make it optional, as potential users might not have a good idea of where they’re interested in looking at homes.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/advanced-registration-forms/form-field-geographic-area.png" alt="Adding the geographic area field."></p>

<p>There are many other available data types, including dates or booleans. There are also other, more targeted form controls, such as a textarea or select dropdowns. You can even store arrays and maps. Please consult <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/form-fields">the API docs</a> for more information.</p>

<p>After saving the above additions, if you view the list of fields, you’ll notice you’ve added three fields. They are available for use in the form you’re going to build next. They can also be used for future forms as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/advanced-registration-forms/list-of-form-fields.png" alt="The list of fields with our custom fields added."></p>

<h2 id="build-the-form">Build the form</h2>

<p>Next you need to build the form. At this point you can mix and match any of the standard, predefined form fields and your recently added custom form fields.</p>

<p>Fields can appear in any order on the form; whatever makes the most sense for your audience works for FusionAuth. When you create a new form, you’ll see a name field and a button to add steps:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/advanced-registration-forms/initial-form.png" alt="The blank form, ready to be assembled."></p>

<p>The only requirements for a registration form are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must have at least one step.</li>
  <li>You must have either an email or a username field in one of your steps.</li>
  <li>You must have a password field in one of your steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>To begin building the real estate application form, navigate to “Customizations” and then to “Forms”. Click the green “+” button to create a new form, and name it. How about something snappy, like “Real estate application signup”? Add the first step, and then the following fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First name</li>
  <li>Email</li>
  <li>Password</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
</ul>

<p>When you’re done, it should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/advanced-registration-forms/form-first-step.png" alt="Adding fields to our first step."></p>

<p>Just as you can add many custom form fields, you can also add as many steps as you want. However, please think of the users who are filling out the form and don’t add too many steps! The Nielson Norman group has a few suggestions about <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/">website form usability</a>, but the number one suggestion is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Keep it short.</em> The mathematician Blaise Pascal famously said: “I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.” This principle applies to web forms as well as prose writing. Eliminating unnecessary fields requires more time, but the reduced user effort and increased completion rates make it worthwhile. … Every time you cut a field or question from a form, you increase its conversion rate — the business case for this guideline is that simple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After you’ve examined the first step, create a second one. Add your custom fields to learn more about their house hunt.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Geographic area of interest</li>
  <li>Minimum house search price</li>
  <li>Maximum house search price</li>
</ul>

<p>After you’ve added these fields to the form, you’ll see this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/advanced-registration-forms/form-second-step.png" alt="Adding fields to our second step."></p>

<p>Feel free to rearrange the form fields within each step by clicking the arrows to move a field up or down. The form configuration specifies steps and field display order within those steps. If you need to move a field between steps, delete it from one step and add it to another. Each field can live in zero or one steps.</p>

<p>To change field validation or other attributes, return to the “Fields” section to make your changes. When you’re done tweaking the form to your liking, save it.</p>

<h2 id="configure-an-application-to-use-your-form">Configure an application to use your form</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve created a form with custom fields, the next step is to specify which applications should use it. Forms and form fields can be reused in any application and any tenant. Since FusionAuth supports multiple tenants per instance, you can easily reuse the fields and forms you’ve created. For each application, simply assign the registration form to the application. Luckily, this is the next step for this tutorial.</p>

<p>Navigate to the “Applications” tab and create a new FusionAuth application. As a reminder, an application is anything a user can sign into: a web application, native app, API, anything. In this case, you are building out the real estate application; pick something descriptive. How about “Real estate search”?</p>

<p>You must configure a redirect URL; this is where the user is sent when registration succeeds. Navigate to the “OAuth” tab of your application and enter “https://fusionauth.io” or another public website. For a production application, of course, you’d instead specify where a user should be sent after registration, such as a profile page. Though the specifics depend on your application settings, such as whether you require email verification, typically a user will be authenticated at the end of this registration process, with all that that entails.</p>

<p>Each application may have multiple redirect URLs. You can configure where to send a user after registration by adding a <code>redirect_uri</code> parameter to the registration form URL. For this tutorial, only one <code>redirect_uri</code> will be configured, and it will be automatically added to the registration URL generated by FusionAuth when you are ready to test drive user registration. Though it is likely enabled, also make sure you check “Authorization Code” under the “Enabled grants” section on the “OAuth” tab.</p>

<p>In addition, you need to configure an application to allow users to register themselves. Otherwise, no users will be allowed to create their own accounts. Which kinda defeats the purpose of this whole post.</p>

<p>Navigate to the “Registration” tab and enable “Self service registration”. Then check the “Advanced” option and select the form you created. Before you click the “Save” button, you’ll see a screen like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/advanced-registration-forms/application-with-custom-form-configured.png" alt="Specifying a custom registration form for our application."></p>

<p>Return to the list of applications. Your form is configured, so the next step is to sign up as a user.</p>

<h2 id="sign-up">Sign up</h2>

<p>The moment you’ve been working towards is here! In just a few clicks, you’ll see the glory of your custom registration form.</p>

<p>But first, find the registration URL. Do so by clicking on the green magnifying glass on the list of applications. The “Registration URL” is what you want:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/advanced-registration-forms/viewing-application-details.png" alt="Finding the registration URL."></p>

<p>Now that you have the URL, open up an incognito window and navigate to it. You can see that the …</p></div></div>

Thanks to super-fast hot reload and restart feature of flutter which makes development experience faster and better. But it would have been better if you can be testing/debugging your application as you are developing on all platform's devices without you have to wait for one device.</p>
<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create different emulator devices you want to run your application on. e.g iOS devices, Android device</li>

<![CDATA[Bootstrap 5 Removes JQuery Dependency]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/">Bootstrap 5 Alpha</a>&nbsp;was released in June 2020. The new Bootstrap removes jQuery and no longer supports Internet Explorer (IE). The team said it’s time to move on from “what’s outdated or no longer appropriate”.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap framework</a>, originally developed and open-sourced by Twitter, has been an indispensable tool for web developers. It provides a ready-to-use set of UI components and a grid system essential for adaptive web pages that need to display well across PC and mobile browsers. Since its inception, Bootstrap has always had a dependency on the jQuery framework. The&nbsp;<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery framework</a>, originally created in 2006, is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks of all time. It provides powerful language features and cross-browser compatibility in an era when web technologies are going through many challenges and experimentations to support a variety of use cases ranging from interactive web pages, single-page apps, AJAX requests, and mobile web apps.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to 2020, with JavaScript standards and dominant web browsers already supporting most of the features in jQuery, the Bootstrap team decided to move on. The Bootstrap 5 framework has removed jQuery as a requirement. It saved 85KB of minified JavaScript, which could be significant as Google starts to&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/search-ads-speed">use page speed as a ranking factor for mobile web sites</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html">soon for desktop web sites</a>&nbsp;as well. The Bootstrap team does this because Bootstrap 5 also no longer supports&nbsp;Internet Explorer. The team noted that all supported browsers provide jQuery replacement features in vanilla JavaScript. The decision to drop Internet Explorer is probably due to the fact that&nbsp;<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide">IE’s market share has now dropped below 3% even among Desktop PC users</a>.</p>



<p>Developer&nbsp;<a href="https://flaviocopes.com/">Flavio Copes</a>&nbsp;has an article on&nbsp;<a href="https://flaviocopes.com/jquery/">“Should you use or learn jQuery in 2020.”</a>&nbsp;In it, he pointed out vanilla JavaScript replacements from jQuery’s most popular features. Here are some examples.</p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_0"><li>Selecting DOM elements using the # or . notation:&nbsp;<code>document.querySelector('.button')</code></li><li>Waiting for page DOM to load:&nbsp;<code>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () =&gt; { ... })</code></li><li>Executing AJAX requests:&nbsp;<code>fetch('/api.json').then(response =&gt; response.text()).then(body =&gt; console.log(body))</code></li></ul>



<p>If developers create a new web application in 2020, jQuery will&nbsp;probably no longer be necessary. The web has finally evolved beyond jQuery.</p>



<p>Another benefit of dropping IE is that Bootstrap 5 supports CSS custom properties. They make CSS more flexible and even programmable. For some examples, check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/tables/#how-do-the-variants-and-accented-tables-work">docs on how to style tables</a>&nbsp;in Bootstrap 5.</p>



<p>Besides dropping jQuery, Bootstrap 5 also brings some notable features. Bootstrap 5 has an updated UI look and feel to focus more on-page content. It has a redesigned and better-looking set of custom form controls. It also has a new logo and&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/26/bootstrap-icons-alpha5/">300+ additional icons</a>. For web sites that make heavy use of icons, the new SVG sprite allows developers to load all icons in a single SVG file and then use them as needed. That will likely increase web site performance and improve HTML readability.</p>



<p>The Bootstrap framework is open-source software available under the MIT license. Submitting bugs and fixes of&nbsp;<a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 5 alpha</a>&nbsp;to the team via its&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/twbs">GitHub repo</a>&nbsp;are welcomed.</p>

<p>“<em>My client is the worst!</em>” Oh cry me a river. This mindset is old and tired. Client blaming is lazy. It’s an excuse to avoid the uncomfortable thought that maybe we are the problem.</p>



<h2>Stop treating the client like a problem to be contained</h2>



<p>The natural reaction to annoying clients is to shut them out. “Don’t let them join the calls! Keep them out of the code! Don’t let them speak directly to developers! Contain, contain, contain!” </p>



<p>But it’s pretty unlikely that your client is purposely sabotaging things for the sake of being a jerkface. They’re probably having some good old fashioned anxiety about the state of the project, and annoying you is their way of dealing with it. </p>



<p>So if you shut them out then their anxiety will increase, and their annoyingness will bump up along with it. I talked about this in my post “<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/25/hide-a-problem-from-your-client-and-now-youve-got-2-problems/">Hide a problem from your client and now you’ve got 2&nbsp;problems</a>“. </p>



<p>Seth Godin talks about <a href="https://seths.blog/2011/05/hard-work-vs-long-work/">hard work vs. long work</a>, which I think applies:</p>



<blockquote><p>Hard work is frightening. We shy away from hard work because inherent in hard work is risk. Hard work is hard because you might fail. You can’t fail at long work, you merely show up.</p><cite>Seth Godin</cite></blockquote>



<p>Shutting them out is long work. It feels less risky, and you just have to keep at it. Figuring out how to let them in is hard work. It feels riskier, but that’s the type of work that will pay off.</p>



<p>The other day I <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/26/extreme-ownership-book-notes/">posted about the book Extreme Ownership</a> and it has a chapter called “Leading Up and Down the Chain of Command” that talks about this. </p>



<blockquote><p>Instead of blaming others, instead of complaining about the boss’s questions, I had to take ownership of the problem and lead. This included the leaders above me in our chain of command.</p><p>If someone isn’t doing what you want or need them to do, look in the mirror first and determine what you can do to better enable this.</p><cite>Leif Babin, “Extreme Ownership”</cite></blockquote>



<p>Stop blaming the client, and start blaming yourself. What are you doing that’s making the client act like this? What does the client need that they aren’t getting? </p>



<p>A <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/24/jobs-to-be-done-is-a-terrible-name/">Jobs To Be Done mindset</a> may help. What’s the client’s JTBD which isn’t being met? Maybe they want their boss to be impressed, and if the project doesn’t go smoothly then that won’t happen. Maybe they want to learn from you, and shutting them out makes that impossible. Whatever it is, try to figure out what JTBD the client is trying to solve, and how you aren’t solving it. </p>



<h2>Start treating the client like a free resource to be tapped</h2>



<p>Your client is the best kind of employee:</p>



<ul><li>They care deeply about the success of the project</li><li>They have the context and insider information you need</li><li>And best of all, you don’t have to pay them a salary</li></ul>



<p>Make use of that! Don’t shut the client out, bring the client in! Get the client into backlog grooming and sprint planning and code review and retrospectives and anything else you can drag them into. </p>



<p>Include them more and more until the client starts to get to the point of feeling <em>too involved</em>, and then you know you’ve hit the sweet spot. </p>



<p>Here are some of the benefits you may see:</p>



<ul><li>The client’s anxiety will decrease, because they won’t be in the dark about things anymore</li><li>The team will benefit from the faster feedback loops and less rework now that the person who has veto power is deeply involved </li><li>If the crap hits the fan, the client is less likely to point fingers because it’s their crap just as much as it is yours</li><li>When it comes time to hand the project off, the transition will be easier since the client was deeply involved along the way</li></ul>



<h2>What are they really paying you for?</h2>



<p>I like to think about what the client is actually buying. Hopefully they aren’t buying a website or an app, because that would make you a vending machine. They <em>may</em> be buying your time and your expertise, if they see you as staff augmentation. </p>



<p>But if you want to be a partner or a trusted advisor, then maybe what they’re really buying is <em>an experience</em>. They think that in choosing you, they’ve chosen a particular experience that you can give them. That experience probably involves phrases like “low anxiety” or “learning environment” or “collaboration”.</p>



<p>I don’t know what experience your client paid for, but I can guarantee it’s not “being shut out.” If you were in the client’s shoes, would you like the experience you’re getting? If not, then turn it around. Build it <em>with</em> them instead of <em>for</em> them. Create the experience they thought they were buying. It’ll help you both.</p>

<p>If you’re ever tasked with implementing a cryptography feature–whether a high-level protocol or a low-level primitive–you will have to take special care to ensure you’re not leaking secret information through side-channels.</p>



<p>The descriptions of algorithms you learn in a classroom or textbook are not sufficient for real-world use. (Yes, that means your toy RSA implementation based on GMP from your computer science 101 class isn’t production-ready. <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">Don’t deploy it</a>.)</p>



<p>But what are these elusive side-channels exactly, and how do you prevent them? And in cases where you cannot prevent them, how can you mitigate the risk to your users?</p>

<h2 id="cryptographic-side-channels">Cryptographic Side-Channels</h2>



<p>The concept of a side-channel isn’t inherently cryptographic, <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/70097430253/crypto-noobs-2-side-channel-attacks">as Taylor Hornby demonstrates</a>, but a side-channel can be a game over vulnerability in a system meant to maintain confidentiality (even if only for its cryptography keys).</p>



<p>Cryptographic side-channels allow an attacker to learn secret data from your cryptography system. To accomplish this, the attacker doesn’t necessarily study the system’s output (i.e. ciphertext); instead, they observe some other measurement, such as how much time or power was spent performing an operation, or what kind of electromagnetic radiation was emitted.</p>



<p><strong>Important:</strong> While being resistant to side-channels is a prerequisite for implementations to be secure, it isn’t in and of itself sufficient for security. The underlying design of the primitives, constructions, and high-level protocols needs to be secure first, and that requires <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications">a clear and specific threat model</a> for what you’re building.</p>



<p>Constant-time ECDSA doesn’t help you if you <a href="https://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/not-playing-randomly-the-sony-ps3-and-bitcoin-crypto-hacks-c1fe92bea9bc">reuse k-values like it’s going out of style</a>, but variable-time ECDSA still leaks your secret key to anyone who cares to probe your response times. Secure cryptography is very demanding.</p>







<h3 id="timing-leaks">Timing Leaks</h3>



<p>Timing side-channels leak secrets through <a href="https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2014/11/its-all-about-time.html">how much time it takes for an operation to complete</a>.</p>



<p>There are many different flavors of timing leakage, including:</p>



<ul><li>Fast-failing comparison functions (memcmp() in C)</li><li>Cache-timing vulnerabilities (e.g. <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/#side-channels">software AES</a>)</li><li>Memory access patterns</li><li>Conditional branches controlled by secrets</li></ul>



<p>The bad news about timing leaks is that they’re almost always visible to an attacker over the network (including <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/pub/crosby-timing2009.pdf">over the Internet (PDF)</a>).</p>



<p>The good news is that most of them can be prevented or mitigated in software.</p>







<h3 id="power-usage">Power Usage</h3>



<p>Different algorithms or processor operations may require different amounts of power.</p>



<p>For example, squaring a large number may take less power than multiplying two different large numbers. This observation has led to the development of <a href="https://anysilicon.com/side-channel-attacks-differential-power-analysis-dpa-simple-power-analysis-spa-works/">power analysis attacks against RSA</a>.</p>



<p>Power analysis is especially relevant for embedded systems and smart cards, which are easier to extract a meaningful signal from than your desktop computer.</p>



<p>Some information leakage through power usage can be prevented through careful engineering (for example: <a href="https://bearssl.org/constanttime.html#rsa">BearSSL</a>, which uses Montgomery multiplication instead of square-and-multiply).</p>



<p>But that’s not always an option, so generally these risks are mitigated.</p>

<h3 id="electromagnetic-emissions">Electromagnetic Emissions</h3>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCgSGZ7S-BQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Your computer is a reliable source of electromagnetic emissions (such as radio waves). Some of these emissions may reveal information about your cryptographic secrets, especially to an attacker with physical proximity to your device.</p>



<p>The good news is that research into EM emission side-channels isn’t as mature as side-channels through timing leaks or power usage. The bad news is that mitigations for breakthroughs will generally require hardware (e.g. electromagnetic shielding).</p>

<h2 id="side-channel-prevention-and-mitigation">Side-Channel Prevention and Mitigation</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve established a rough sense of some of the <em>types</em> of side-channels that are possible, we can begin to identify what causes them and aspire to prevent the leaks from happening–and where we can’t, to mitigate the risk to a reasonable level.</p>



<p>Note: To be clear, I didn’t cover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack#General">all of the types of side-channels</a>.</p>



<h3 id="prevention-mitigation">Prevention vs. Mitigation</h3>



<p>Preventing a side-channel means eliminating the conditions that allow the information leak to occur in the first place. For timing leaks, this means making all algorithms constant-time.</p>



<p>There are entire classes of side-channel leaks that aren’t possible or practical to mitigate in software. When you encounter one, the best you can hope to do is mitigate the risk.</p>



<p>Ideally, you want to make the attack more expensive to pull off than the reward an attacker will gain from it.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-constant-time">What is Constant-Time?</h3>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZD_H1ePLylA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p><figcaption>Toto, I don’t think we’re in <s>Tanelorn</s> Kansas anymore.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When an implementation is said to be constant-time, what we mean is that <strong>the execution time of the code is not a function of its secret inputs</strong>.</p>



<p>Vulnerable AES uses table look-ups to implement the S-Box. Constant-time AES is either implemented in hardware, or is <a href="https://bearssl.org/constanttime.html#aes">bitsliced</a>.</p>



<h3 id="malicious-environments-and-algorithmic-constant-time">Malicious Environments and Algorithmic Constant-Time</h3>



<p>One of the greatest challenges with writing constant-time code is distinguishing between <strong>algorithmic constant-time</strong> and <strong>provably constant-time</strong>. The main difference between the two is that <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf">you cannot trust your compiler</a> (especially a JIT compiler), which may attempt to optimize your code in a way that reintroduces the side-channel you aspired to remove.</p>



<blockquote><p>A sufficiently advanced compiler optimization is indistinguishable from an adversary.</p><cite><a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/970">John Regehr</a>, possibly with apologies to <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>For compiled languages, this is a tractable but expensive problem to solve: You simply have to formally verify everything from the source code to the compiler to the silicon chips that the code will be deployed on, and then audit your supply chain to prevent malicious tampering from going undetected.</p>



<p>For interpreted languages (e.g. PHP and JavaScript), this formal verification strategy isn’t really an option, unless you want to formally verify the runtime that interprets scripts and prove that the operations remain constant-time on top of all the other layers of distrust.</p>



<p>Is this level of paranoia really worth the effort?</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For that reason, we’re going to assume that <strong>algorithmic constant-time is adequate</strong> for the duration of this blog post.</p>



<p>If your threat model prevents you from accepting this assumption, feel free to put in the extra effort yourself and tell me how it goes. After all, as a furry who writes blog posts in my spare time for fun, I don’t exactly have the budget for massive research projects in formal verification.</p>



<h3 id="mitigation-with-blinding-techniques">Mitigation with Blinding Techniques</h3>



<p>The best mitigation for some side-channels is called blinding: Obfuscating the inputs with some random data, then deobfuscating the outputs with the same random data, such that your keys are not revealed.</p>



<p>Two well-known examples include <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/54772">RSA decryption</a> and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman. I’ll focus on the latter, since it’s not as widely covered in the literature (although several cryptographers I’ve talked with were somehow knowledgeable about it; I suspect <a href="https://medium.com/@soatok/gatekeeping-in-online-communities-48dec7f97f6a">gatekeeping</a> is involved).</p>



<h4>Blinded ECDH Key Exchange</h4>



<p>In typical ECDH implementations, you will convert a point on a Weierstrass curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28X%2C+Y%29&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="(X, Y)" title="(X, Y)"> to a Jacobian coordinate system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C+y%29&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="(x, y)" title="(x, y)">.</p>



<p>The exact conversion formula is (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+X+%2F+Z%5E%7B2%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="x = X / Z^{2}" title="x = X / Z^{2}">, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y+%3D+X+%2F+Z%5E%7B3%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="y = X / Z^{3}" title="y = X / Z^{3}">). The conversion almost makes intuitive sense.</p>



<p>Where does <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="Z" title="Z"> come from though?</p>







<p>It turns out, the choice for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="Z" title="Z"> is totally arbitrary. Libraries typically set it equal to 1 (for best performance), but you can also set it to a random number. (You cannot set it to 0, however, for obvious reasons.)</p>



<p>Choosing a random number means the calculations performed over Jacobian coordinates will be obscured by a randomly chosen factor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="Z" title="Z"> (and thus, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="Z" title="Z"> is only used once per scalar multiplication, the bitwise signal the attackers rely on will be lost).</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I think it’s really cool how one small tweak to the runtime of an algorithm can <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2010/62250433/62250433.pdf">make it significantly harder to attack</a>.</p>



<h2 id="design-patterns">Design Patterns for Algorithmic Constant-Time Code</h2>



<p>Mitigation techniques are cool, but preventing side-channels is a better value-add for most software. </p>



<p>To that end, let’s look at some design patterns for constant-time software. Some of these are relatively common; others, not so much.</p>







<h3 id="string-comparison">Constant-Time String Comparison</h3>



<p>Rather than using string comparison (== in most programming languages, memcmp() in C), you want to compare cryptographic secrets and/or calculated integrity checks with a secure compare algorithm, which looks like this:</p>



<ol><li>Initialize a variable (let’s call it D) to zero. </li><li>For each byte of the two strings:<ol><li>Calculate (left<sub>i</sub> XOR right<sub>i</sub>)</li><li>Bitwise OR the current value of D with the result of the XOR, store the output in D</li></ol></li><li>When the loop has concluded, D will be equal to 0 if and only if the two strings are equal.</li></ol>



<p>In code form, it looks like this:</p>



<pre><code>&lt;?php
function ct_compare(string $left, string $right): bool
{
    $d = 0;
    $length = mb_strlen($left, '8bit');
    if (mb_strlen($right, '8bit') !== $length) {
        return false; // Lengths differ
    }
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $length; ++$i) {
        $leftCharCode = unpack('C', $left[$i])[1];
        $rightCharCode = unpack('C', $right[$i])[1];</code></pre></div></div></div>

<p>Earlier this summer, the U.S. government announced it was considering banning Chinese social media apps,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/07/tiktok-ban-china-usa-pompeo/">including the popular app TikTok</a>. In August, President Trump signed two executive orders to block transactions with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/">ByteDance</a>, TikTok’s parent company, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-wechat/">Tencent</a>, which owns the popular messaging service and commercial platform WeChat, and&nbsp;<a href="https://publicpool.kinja.com/subject-order-regarding-the-acquisition-of-musical-ly-1844732563">another executive order</a>&nbsp;requiring ByteDance&nbsp;to sell or spin off its U.S. TikTok business within 90 days, as well as to destroy all its copies of TikTok data attached to U.S. users. As companies including Microsoft, Walmart, and Oracle have expressed interest in buying the app,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/technology/tiktok-sues-us-government-over-trump-ban.html">TikTok is suing the U.S. government</a>, accusing the Trump administration of depriving it of due process.</p>



<p>The proposed ban, according to the Trump administration, is intended to safeguard the privacy of U.S. citizens and shield data about them — and government officials — from the Chinese government. Trump’s August 6 executive order&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/11/21363092/why-is-tiktok-national-security-threat-wechat-trump-ban">claims</a>&nbsp;TikTok could “allow China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.” But, is TikTok really a threat? And if it is, what are the possible consequences of these actions by the U.S.?</p>



<p>As researchers who have studied similar bans on technologies, we believe that this chain of events could have sweeping impacts on the business community, which will likely not be confined to the tech sector.</p>



<h3>What Is the Threat?</h3>



<p>If data collection by a company with overseas connections comprises a threat, there are threats all around. The data that TikTok collects pales in comparison to, say, what most American tech companies (as well as banks, credit agencies, and hotels) collect, both visibly and less so. Many institutions that collect sensitive data have already been hacked — it is estimated that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cybintsolutions.com/cyber-security-facts-stats/#:~:text=A%20Clark%20School%20study%20at,give%20attackers%20more%20chance%20of">there is a cyber attack every 39 seconds</a>&nbsp;— and much of that information is for sale on the Dark Web. If the Chinese government wanted the kind of information TikTok could collect, it could be obtained in many other ways.</p>



<p>What will likely prove a more pressing threat to U.S. customers is much more low-tech: Setting a precedent of banning everyday technologies could quickly spiral out of control and seriously disrupt almost all international trade.</p>



<h3>A Growing Trend</h3>



<p>While the case against TikTok may seem novel, it’s actually just the most recent high-profile incident in a string of cases of countries banning products or services over alleged cybersecurity concerns. In our research, we have studied more than 75 such events involving more than 31 countries going back almost 20 years, though most occurred in the past five years. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/02/24/my-friend-cayla-doll-privacy-concerns/">in 2017, Germany banned</a>&nbsp;My Friend Carly — a doll from the U.S. that you could talk to you — because the conversation was processed by servers in the U.S. In 2016, Russia&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-linkedin-russia-ban/linkedin-fails-to-agree-with-russia-on-restoring-access-to-site-idUSKBN16E20Q">blocked access to LinkedIn</a>, stating that LinkedIn refused to store personal data of Russian users in Russia. In 2017&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_bans_and_allegations_of_Russian_government_ties">U.S. blocked the Russian security company Kaspersky</a>&nbsp;over its alleged ties to the Russian government.</p>



<p>These cases build on a trend of high-profile bans, such as when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/major-us-tech-companies-blocked-from-operating-in-china-2019-5#google-2">China blocked Facebook, Twitter, and Google</a>&nbsp;(2009), and when BlackBerry was banned or threatened&nbsp;<a href="https://thenextweb.com/me/2010/08/28/5-countries-that-will-or-have-banned-blackberry/">with a ban in India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates</a>&nbsp;(2010).</p>



<p>Because any product that contains a computer or service that uses a computer — nowadays just about everything — can introduce cybersecurity risks, the frequency and impact of these events is increasing. (My electronic toothbrush has a computer in it and is connected to the Internet.) Examining the millions of lines of software or firmware in these products and services is not currently feasible, therefore decisions are made based on the perceived risks, which can be impacted by factors such as trust and capability to manage cybersecurity risks. There have been restrictions imposed on products and services as diverse as: medical devices, videoconference services, software products, security software, social media, security cameras, banking IT systems, drones, smartphones, smart toys, online content services, satellite communications, AI software, and financial services such as international fund transfers and payment systems.</p>



<p>According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s&nbsp;<a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=STRI_DIGITAL">Digital Trade Service Restrictiveness Index</a>, 13 of the 46 majority economies have&nbsp;<a href="https://qdd.oecd.org/subject.aspx?Subject=STRI_DIGITAL">increased their digital trade restrictions</a>&nbsp;between 2014 and 2019, while only four countries reduced their restrictions.</p>



<p>In general, there are four strategies for managing risks: accept, avoid, mitigate, and transfer. There are&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/01/what-countries-and-companies-can-do-when-trade-and-cybersecurity-overlap">many practical options</a>&nbsp;that countries and companies can adopt to manage cybersecurity risks from cross-border digital products/services. Unfortunately, banning products is becoming increasingly common — and doesn’t appear to be a particularly sustainable strategy.</p>



<h3><strong>Why This Time Is Different&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The proposed ban reinforces a growing&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/choke-points">belief</a>&nbsp;that America is no longer the leading guarantor of global business, but rather a potential threat to it — a notion that is profoundly reshaping the world economy and threatening American businesses. TikTok and WeChat both have massive user bases (800 million and close to 1.2 billion, respectively). Removing WeChat from the Apple Store could cause Apple’s iPhone sales to fall by around 30%&nbsp;<a href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/08/wechat-ban-could-cost-apple-30-of-global-sales/">according to one prominent analyst</a>. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-america-worries-wechat-ban-could-be-bad-for-business-11597311003">an August call with White House officials</a>, more than a dozen major U.S. multinational companies raised concerns that banning WeChat could undermine their competitiveness in the Chinese market.</p>



<p>The second-order cost of sabotaging the international business environment with these policies could be much higher:&nbsp;86% of companies in the U.S.-China Business Council&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uschina.org/sites/default/files/uscbc_member_survey_2020.pdf">have reported</a>&nbsp;experiencing negative impacts on their business with China. The biggest impact was lost sales because customers shift their suppliers or sourcing due to uncertainty of continued supply. Companies worried about a U.S. ban may just initiate a&nbsp;“De-Americanization” plan to remove or replace U.S. components in their products and supply chains. For example, in February 2019, WorldFirst, a U.K-based international money transfer service that many big Amazon sellers relied on,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8489b8fa-2484-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632">closed its U.S. business</a>&nbsp;as a precursor to its acquisition by Chinese-based Ant Financial. This was considered the only way to avoid U.S. regulators blocking the deal over national security concerns. On the other hand, the Chinese company Hikvision&nbsp;<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Hikvision-launched-de-Americanization-plan-before-blacklist">found alternatives</a>&nbsp;to most of its U.S. components so that being added to the U.S. trade blacklist had a limited impact on its business.</p>



<h3>Weighing the Political Risks</h3>



<p>Business executives need to realize that in addition to following the best practices to reduce the perceived cybersecurity risks from their digital product/services, preparing for political risks is also necessary. TikTok&nbsp;<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/24/trump-cant-ban-tiktok-free-chinese-apps/">implemented several practices</a>&nbsp;to mitigate the risks, including: storing U.S. user data in the U.S. and backing it up on Singaporean servers, blocking access to its data from its mother company ByteDance, hiring an American CEO and operations team, beefing up its lobbying team, withdrawing from Hong Kong based on the concerns over China’s new national security law, launching a&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-to-launch-transparency-center-for-moderation-and-data-practices">“transparency center”</a>&nbsp;for moderation and data practices in Los Angeles,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/tiktok-bans-political-advocacy-advertising-its-platform-n1062221">banning political and advocacy advertising</a>&nbsp;from its platform, and setting up a global&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-searches-for-global-headquarters-outside-of-china-11577097150">headquarters</a>&nbsp;outside of China. TikTok and its employees are preparing to battle the ban&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-employees-trump-lawsuits/">in separate lawsuits</a>.</p>



<p>Though these practices have not yet helped TikTok to void the ban, they will probably be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/22/technology/tiktok-lawsuit-trump-executive-order.html">major arguments</a>&nbsp;in its lawsuit against the U.S. Furthermore, these practices may be important directions that all companies might need to follow for doing international business in the new normal to address concerns over cybersecurity risks.</p>



<p>In reality, banning is more likely to increase — not reduce — risk, because it builds up distrust&nbsp;among countries and companies. Other countries may retaliate by banning U.S. companies and the situation could rapidly spiral.</p>



<p>In recent years, governments have tried to increase their ability to access the data contained on these devices and services. For example, WhatsApp advertises that it “secures your conversations with end-to-end encryption, which means your messages and status updates stay between you and the people you choose.” But, several times, most recently in October 2019, the U.S., UK and Australia have applied pressure on Facebook to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/03/facebook-surveillance-us-uk-australia-backdoor-encryption">create backdoors</a>&nbsp;that would allow access to encrypted message content. So far, Facebook and WhatsApp have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medianama.com/2019/12/223-no-backdoor-whatsapp-facebook-to-usa-uk-australia/">refused</a>. If such backdoors are allowed and become commonplace, then every Internet-connected device will essentially be a spy device and likely be banned by every other country.</p>



<p>The abuse of “national security threat” is snowballing and leading to an escalating trade war that could disrupt world trade. We saw a similar situation caused by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act">Smoot-Hawley Tariffs</a>&nbsp;in the 1930s. The goal was to protect U.S. farmers and other industries that were suffering during the Great Depression by raising tariffs and discouraging import of products from other countries. But, not surprisingly, almost all of the U.S. trade partners retaliated and raised their tariffs. That resulted in U.S. imports decreasing 66%&nbsp;and exports decreasing 61% making the “Great Depression” much greater. In general, there are rarely winners in trade wars, and probably not in cyber trade wars.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>We have learned real inner product very well in high school or college. However, when it comes to sophisticated inner product and inner product space, such as complex inner product and complex inner product space, sometimes it is confusing.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the inner product, inner product space, and a definition discrepancy that sometimes people ignored.</p>

<h3 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space</h3>

<h4 id="vector-space">Vector Space</h4>

<p>In case someone does not know what vector space, it was defined clearly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#Definition">Wikipedia</a> and it was not hard to understand. The only caveat is probably that in addition to the conventional valued vector space, function space is also a vector space.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product">Inner Product</h4>

<p>An inner product (also called a dot product or scalar product) on a complex vector space $\mathbb{V}$ is a function</p><p>

\[\langle -, - \rangle : \mathbb{V} \times \mathbb{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}\]

</p><p>that satisfies the following four properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$\langle v_1 + v_2, w \rangle = \langle v_1, w \rangle + \langle v_2, w \rangle$ for all $v_1, v_2, w \in \mathbb{V}$</li>
  <li>$\langle cv, w \rangle = c \langle v, w \rangle$ for all $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$</li>
  <li>$\langle w, v \rangle = \overline{ \langle v, w \rangle }$ for all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$</li>
  <li>$\langle v, v \rangle$ is a positive real number for any $v \in \mathbb{V} \sim \{0\}$</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that there is discrepancy on the property 2. Some people defined the property 2 to be $\langle cv, w \rangle = \overline{c}\langle v, w \rangle$ for all $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$. The difference would affect the definition of the inner product space. Many people were not aware of this definition difference and made mistakes sometimes. For inner product of real numbers, there is no such discrepancy since $c = \overline{c}$ for any $c \in \mathbb{R}$.</p>

<h4 id="derived-inner-product-properties">Derived Inner Product Properties</h4>

<p>Based on the four inner product properties, we could further derive more inner product properties.</p>



<p>$\langle v, w_1 + w_2 \rangle = \langle v, w_1 \rangle + \langle v, w_2 \rangle$ for all $v, w_1, w_2 \in \mathbb{V}$</p>



<p>This is because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle v, w_1 + w_2 \rangle &amp;= \overline{\langle w_1 + w_2, v \rangle}\\
&amp;= \overline{\langle w_1, v \rangle + \langle w_2, v \rangle} \\
&amp;= \overline{\langle w_1, v \rangle} + \overline{\langle w_2, v \rangle} \\
&amp;= \langle v, w_1 \rangle + \langle v, w_2 \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>$\langle v, cw \rangle = \overline{c} \langle v, w \rangle$ for all $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$</p>



<p>This is because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle v, cw \rangle &amp;= \overline{\langle cw, v \rangle} \\
&amp;= \overline{c \langle w, v \rangle} \\
&amp;= \overline{c} \overline{\langle w, v \rangle} \\
&amp;= \overline{c} \langle v, w \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $\overline{ab} = \overline{a}\overline{b}$ and this could be easily verified.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-space">Inner Product Space</h4>

<p>An inner product space is a vector space along with an inner product.</p>



<p>This sounds awkward. But it is just literally a vector space with an inner product expression defined.</p>



<p>For example, we have the following complex inner product space.</p>



<p>Given vector space $\mathbb{C}^n$, we have two vectors $v = \{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n\}, w = \{w_1, w_2, \cdots, w_n\} \in \mathbb{C}^n$, the inner product is defined as</p><p>

\[\langle v, w \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i \overline{w}_i\]

</p><p>Note that the above inner product definition was defined given the property 2 of inner product was defined as $\langle cv, w \rangle = c \langle v, w \rangle$.</p>



<p>If the the property 2 of inner product was defined as $\langle cv, w \rangle = \overline{c}\langle v, w \rangle$, then the above inner product definition would become</p><p>

\[\langle v, w \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \overline{v}_i w_i\]

</p><p>This discrepancy also extends to other complex inner product spaces such as for $\mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, etc.</p>



<p>We would see, probably in my future blogs, that we have such different inner product definitions under different inner product properties is to satisfy some special properties of Hermitian matrix, so that some mathematical conclusions would be unified regardless of which way you defined the property 2 of inner product.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Always pay close attention to the definitions in mathematics.</p>

<p>Pop quiz: Apart from being tech companies, what do Amazon, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Spotify, Kickstarter, Indiegogo, DoorDash, Postmates, and TaskRabbit all have in common?</p>



<p>Answer: They all use&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe</a>&nbsp;to process payments.</p>

<p>While it might not be a household name (yet), Stripe has quietly been taking over the world of online payments. In fact, if you’re reading this post, there’s a good chance you’ve already made a purchase via Stripe (even if you didn’t know it).</p>



<p>In the past year,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/jdewitt29/status/1050017508516876289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">84%</a>&nbsp;of U.S. adults purchased something via Stripe. And when you consider that there are now more than&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/us/customers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a million</a>&nbsp;businesses using Stripe to process payments, it’s easy to see how that 84% figure became a reality.</p>

<p>Of course, Stripe’s success didn’t happen overnight. The company’s co-founders, brothers Patrick Collison and John Collison, started the company in 2010 after dropping out of college and receiving a seed investment from Y Combinator (the startup accelerator program). And while older brother Patrick, Stripe’s CEO, was 21-years-old when they founded Stripe, and younger brother John, Stripe’s president, was 19, this wasn’t their first rodeo. They sold a previous company, Auctomatic, for $5 million in 2008, back when Patrick was 19 and John was just 17.</p>



<p>Flash forward to 2018 and Patrick and John Collison are two of the youngest billionaires in the world. After raising $245 million in September of 2018, their company Stripe is now valued at $20 billion – 4,000x more than what their first company had been worth.</p>

<p>When you look at this incredible level of&nbsp;hypergrowth&nbsp;that Stripe has been able to achieve, it begs the obvious question:</p>



<p><strong>How the heck did they do it?</strong></p>



<p>In this post, we’ll dive deep into how Stripe was able to go from $0 to $20 billion in less than a decade. Ultimately, there are four key lessons all companies can benefit from implementing:</p>



<ol><li>Solve a real problem.</li><li>Obsess over customer experience.</li><li>Have a vision for the future.</li><li>Read books…lots of books.</li></ol>



<h2>1) Solve a real problem.</h2>



<p><strong>☝️ That’s how Stripe generated word-of-mouth around their new product.</strong></p>



<p>When the Collisons launched their first company, Auctomatic, back in 2007, they came to an unexpected realization. They realized that the hardest part of starting an online business wasn’t coming up with an idea, or coding that idea into reality, or marketing that idea to potential customers. Instead, as John explained in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/stripe-payments-apple-amazon-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, “The hardest part was finding a way to accept customers’ money.”</p>



<p>At the time, the largest eCommerce companies invested in building their own systems for processing payments online. But for scrappy startups (like Auctomatic), this wasn’t a viable solution. Doing so was too expensive and required weeks of back-and-forth with the bank. So instead, many of those startups turned to PayPal, which promised to make accepting online payments easier. Only…it didn’t. To the Collisons, PayPal still felt unnecessarily clunky and complex, and it came with too many regulations and setup fees. For developers who wanted to get payments up-and-running on a website quickly and easily, there was still no solution on the market.&nbsp;<strong>At a time when every other aspect of starting an online business had become easier, accepting payments remained complicated.</strong></p>



<p>And that’s how the idea for&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/press" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe</a>&nbsp;– “a developer-focused, instant-setup payment platform that [can] scale to any size” – was born. As John told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1813087/inside-stripe-paypal-competitor-backed-paypal-founders-peter-thiel-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast Company</a>, “Stripe really did come about because we were really appalled by how hard it was to charge for things online.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.004.jpeg" alt="Josh Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>In 2011, the year the Collisons officially launched Stripe, they visited PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and told them, in a nutshell, that PayPal was outdated and broken. Then, the Collisons asked them for money…and got it. Recognizing the issues the Collisons saw with the current online payments infrastructure were legitimate, Thiel and Musk led Stripe’s $2 million Series A round of fundraising that same year alongside Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz.</p>



<p>Talk about a gutsy move. As John told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/stripe-payments-apple-amazon-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, “It’s a little impetuous to go to PayPal founders and say payments on the internet are totally broken. But look, you can WhatsApp anyone around the world and it’s free. It’s a remarkable act of coordination between the telcos and ISPs and the people who own the fiber underneath the sea to create this global communications network. Then, if you look at the economic infrastructure, we haven’t even started.”</p>



<p>The Collison brothers didn’t set out to revolutionize the world of online payments processing when they founded Stripe. Instead, they set out to solve the legitimate problem they faced as developers and entrepreneurs. And, as it turns out, they weren’t alone. Fellow developers and entrepreneurs who were part of the same accelerator program (remember Y Combinator) were experiencing the same problem and soon began adopting Stripe in droves – and they began telling their friends about it.</p>



<p>For the first couple of years, word of mouth among developers was the lifeblood of Stripe’s business. As Patrick explained in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="http://techzinglive.com/page/939/168-tz-interview-patrick-collison-stripe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechZing</a>, “Initially it very much spread through a word of mouth process. That was surprising to us because it’s a payment system not a social network so it’s not something you’d think would have any virality whatsoever. But it became clear that everything else was so bad and so painful to work with that people actually were selling this to their friends.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.005.jpeg" alt="Patrick Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>It’s clear that the spark that got Stripe’s growth started was identifying a legitimate problem that resonated with lots of people. But in order to maintain the word of mouth that accompanied Stripe’s launch, and in order to keep that word of mouth positive, Stripe couldn’t simply rest on its laurels: It needed to invest in delivering a stellar customer experience, both for its own customers and for its customers’ customers.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.drift.com/summit/revgrowth-virtual-experiences/"></a>2) Obsess over customer experience.</h2>



<p><strong>☝️ That’s how Stripe attracted its biggest accounts, like Lyft.</strong></p>



<p>Developers who switch from legacy payments processing systems to Stripe notice the difference in experience&nbsp;<em>immediately</em>. For starters, installing Stripe on a website or in an app requires copying and pasting just seven lines of code – that’s it! A process that once took weeks can now happen in a single day.</p>



<p>As John explained in an interview with NPR, “We have lots of stories of people integrating payments in an afternoon or an evening and then launching their business the next day. And that just worked consistently.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.006.jpeg" alt="Josh Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>Of course, that installation experience is essential to what makes Stripe such an effective product. As you read in the previous section, developers had been longing for a payments solution they could quickly and easily plug into their own products, and Stripe delivered.</p>



<p>In addition to making their installation process a breeze, Stripe made their entire end-to-end customer experience as enjoyable as possible. For example, Stripe’s documentation is famously clear and concise, which makes it easy for developers to find answers to any questions they might have. Stripe also regularly hosts meetups, hackathons, and other events where developers can talk about their experiences with Stripe and share best practices.</p>



<p>Stripe did such a good job of building goodwill around its brand that when it started sending out welcome packages to new customers, which included Stripe-branded stickers and t-shirts,&nbsp;<em>developers actually wore those t-shirts</em>. As Facebook product manager Morgan Brown wrote in a&nbsp;<a href="https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/how-stripe-marketed-to-developers-so-effectively" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growth Hackers</a>&nbsp;article, the Stripe swag “only fueled the positive vibes developers had of the company. These t-shirts were worn proudly and the care packages shared on social media, mostly from developer recipients to other developers who they were connected to online.”</p>



<p>And while it’s easy to see how Stripe’s focus on customer experience helped the service become even more popular among developers, we’re still only looking at one half of the Stripe experience. Because in addition to reimagining the way sellers accepted payments online, Stripe also reimagined the way buyers pay for things online. In other words, Stripe isn’t just concerned about the experiences its customers have, it’s also concerned about the experiences its customers’ customers have.</p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor, Paypal, Stripe doesn’t insert itself into the buying process. Instead, it works behind the scenes, which means buyers never have to leave a company’s checkout page or enter some third-party-branded workflow in order to complete a transaction. When you buy something from a company via Stripe, Stripe gets out of the way and does its job in the background. It’s seamless – there are no interruptions.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as a seller, using Stripe means you get to maintain a one-to-one connection with your buyer. As Stripe’s Chief Business Officer, Bill Alvarado, told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1813087/inside-stripe-paypal-competitor-backed-paypal-founders-peter-thiel-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast Company</a>&nbsp;back in 2012: “You look at Google Checkout, you look at PayPal – they get in the way of the product. In many ways, Google and PayPal are trying to create their own relationship with your customer. I think that’s the thing that Stripe has done right. We’ve designed this for fast use, yes, but also so that you can retain control of your experience, your product, and your customers.”</p>



<p>It’s this dedication to customer experience that led to Stripe win deals with major companies, like Facebook, Google, Slack, Salesforce.com, Shopify, Target, OpenTable, Yelp, and Lyft. Case in point: When the Collison brothers were asked in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=608512576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NPR</a>&nbsp;interview how Stripe was able to get a company like Lyft’s attention, John responded that the fundamental and most important thing was that Stripe “enabled product experiences that they wanted to have.”</p>



<p>Specifically, with Lyft, the ride-sharing service needed a system that allowed them to both charge their customers&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;pay their drivers – something that didn’t exist yet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main">
      <p>This blog post explains the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> and the corresponding new PyTorch <a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="main-contributions">Main contributions</h2>
<p>We introduce a new energy function and a corresponding new update rule which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the energy function.</p>

<p>The new energy function is a generalization (discrete states \(\Rightarrow\) continuous states) of <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> aka <strong>Dense Associative Memories</strong> introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01929">Demircigil et al.</a>
The new modern Hopfield Network with continuous states keeps the characteristics of its discrete counterparts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exponential storage capacity</li>
  <li>extremely fast convergence</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprisingly, the new update rule is the attention mechanism of transformer networks introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>.
We use these new insights to analyze transformer models in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-blog-post-is-about">What this blog post is about</h2>

<p>This blog post is split into three parts. First, we make the transition from traditional Hopfield Networks towards <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> and their generalization to continuous states through our <strong>new energy function</strong>. Second, the properties of our new energy function and the connection to the self-attention mechanism of transformer networks is shown. Finally, we introduce and explain a new PyTorch layer (<a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>), which is built on the insights of our work. We show several practical use cases, i.e. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13505">Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire Classification</a>, Hopfield pooling, and associations of two sets.</p>

<h2 id="from-classical-hopfield-networks-to-self-attention">From classical Hopfield Networks to self-attention</h2>

<p><strong>Associative memories</strong> are one of the earliest artificial neural models dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Best known are <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">Hopfield Networks</a>, presented by John Hopfield in 1982.
As the name suggests, the main purpose of associative memory networks is to associate an input with its most similar pattern. In other words, the purpose is to store and retrieve patterns.
We start with a review of classical Hopfield Networks.</p>

<h3 id="hopfield-networks">Hopfield Networks</h3>

<p>The simplest associative memory is just a <strong>sum of outer products</strong> of the \(N\) patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) that we want to store (Hebbian learning rule). In classical Hopfield Networks these patterns are polar (binary), i.e. \(\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1 \}^d\), where \(d\) is the length of the patterns. The corresponding weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_i^N \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ . \tag{1}
\end{equation}\]

<p>The weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) stores the patterns, which can be retrieved starting with a <strong>state pattern</strong> \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Nomenclature</strong></p>

<p>From now on we denote the \(N\) <strong>stored patterns</strong> as \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) and any <strong>state pattern</strong> or <strong>state</strong> as \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>

<p>The basic <strong>synchronuous update rule</strong> is to repeatedly multiply the state pattern \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\), subtract the bias and take the sign:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} =  \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\xi}^t - \boldsymbol{b}) \ , \tag{2}
\label{eq:restorage}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is a bias vector, which can be interpreted as threshold for every component.
The <strong>asynchronous update rule</strong> performs this update only for one component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) and then selects the next component for update.
Convergence is reached if \(\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} = \boldsymbol{\xi^{t}}\).</p>

<p>The asynchronous version of the update rule of Eq. \eqref{eq:restorage} minimizes the <strong>energy function</strong> \(\text{E}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\text{E} = -\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\xi}^T \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^T\boldsymbol{b} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^d\sum_{j=1}^d w_{ij}\xi_i\xi_j + \sum_{i=1}^d b_i\xi_i \ . \tag{3}
\label{eq:energy_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>As derived in the papers of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=58341">Bruck</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X85900290">Goles-Chacc et al.</a> and <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">the original Hopfield paper</a>, the convergence properties are dependent on the structure of the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) and the method by which the nodes are updated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For asynchronous updates with \(w_{ii} \geq 0\) and \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state.</li>
  <li>For synchronous updates with \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state or a limit cycle of length 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the asynchronous update rule and symmetric weights, \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) \leq \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) holds. When \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) = \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) for the update of every component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^t\), a local minimum in \(\text{E}\) is reached.
All stored patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) should be fixed points of the Hopfield Network, i.e.</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x}_i = \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{b}) \ . \tag{4}
\end{equation}\]

<p>They should even be local minima of \(\text{E}\).</p>

<p>In the following example, no bias vector is used. This means that taking the inverse image, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</p>

<p>We start with an <strong>illustrative example</strong> of a Hopfield Network. <strong>One input image</strong> should first be stored and then be retrieved.
The input image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_original.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>Since an associative memory has <strong>polar states and patterns</strong> (or binary states and patterns), we convert the input image to a black and white image:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>The <strong>weight matrix</strong> \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is the outer product of this black and white image \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ , \tag{5}
\label{eq:weight_matrix}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where for this example \(d = 64 \times 64\).</p>

<p>Can the original image be restored if half of the pixels are masked out? The masked image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>which is our inital state \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\). This inital state is updated via multiplication with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\).
It takes one update until the original image is restored.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked_retrieved.png" alt="not found" width="600px"></p>

<p>What happens if we store <strong>more than one pattern</strong>? The weight matrix is then built from the sum of outer products of <strong>three stored patterns</strong> (three input images):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ . \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_6.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_12.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>In this figure, the left hand side shows the three stored patterns, and the right hand side shows masked state patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) together with the retrieved patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{\text{new}}\).</p>

<p>Looking at the upper row of images might suggest that the retrieval process is no longer perfect. But there are two interesting facts to take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Masking the original images introduces many pixel values of \(-1\). We therefore have the odd behavior that the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Bart}}\rangle\) is larger than the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\rangle\).</li>
  <li>As stated above, if no bias vector is used, the inverse of the pattern, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the retrieval of the upper image looks incorrect, it is de facto correct. However, for the lower row example, the retrieval is no longer correct.
The weights of \(2 \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Marge}}\) have simply overwritten the weights of \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\).
For both examples, only the retrieval after the first update step is shown, but the results do not change when performing further update steps.
The next figure shows the Hopfield Network retrieval for 6 patterns.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_115.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>Clearly, retrieving the patterns is imperfect. One might suspect that the limited storage capacities of Hopfield Networks, see <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.3548&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Amit et al.</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.061910">Torres et al</a>, is the problem.
However, we show now that the storage capacity is not directly responsible for the imperfect retrieval.
The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns free of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong \frac{d}{2\log(d)} \ , \tag{7}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(d\) is the dimension of the input.</p>

<p>The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong 0.14 d\ . \tag{8}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield2}
\end{equation}\]

<p>In the example, the storage capacity is \(C \cong 0.14 d = 0.14 \cdot 64 \cdot 64 \sim 570\).
Thus, insufficient storage capacity is not directly responsible for the retrieval errors.
Instead, the example patterns are correlated, therefore the retrieval has errors.</p>

<p>Consequently, we need a model which <strong>allows pulling apart close patterns</strong>, such that (strongly) <strong>correlated patterns can be distinguished</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>On storage capacity</strong></p>

<p>The storage capacities stated in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield} and in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield2} are derived for \(w_{ii}=0\).
Recently, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> analyzed the storage capacity for Hopfield Networks with \(w_{ii}\geq 0\). Also for \(w_{ii}\geq 0\), a storage capacity of \(C \cong 0.14 d\)
for retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors was observed. The ratio \(C/d\) is often called <strong>load parameter</strong> and denoted by \(\alpha\). <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> showed that there is a second regime with very large \(\alpha\), where the storage capacity is much higher, i.e. more fixed points exist. However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07741">Rocci et al.</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/8/726/htm">Gosti et al.</a> reported that these fixed points for very large \(\alpha\) are unstable and do not have an attraction basin.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="modern-hopfield-networks-aka-dense-associative-memories">Modern Hopfield Networks (aka Dense Associative Memories)</h3>

<p>The storage capacity is a crucial characteristic of Hopfield Networks. <strong>Modern Hopfield Networks</strong> (aka Dense Associative Memories) introduce a new energy function instead of the energy in Eq. \eqref{eq:energy_hopfield} to create a higher storage capacity. <strong>Discrete</strong> modern Hopfield Networks have been introduced first by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> …</p></div></div>

<p>It’s become increasingly obvious that of all the wonderful things the internet has made possible, the increased ease of sharing lies is one of the downsides. Fundamentally, this phenomena was in part caused by the ways that various interlocking systems, both natural and artificial, have evolved over the past decades to make the truth relatively more difficult to share than lies. And although the truth has also been made much more accessible than before, it’s the relative strength, or more precisely relative incentives that really determines real world behavior. And this is a fight that lies have been steadily gaining in.</p>



<p>There is a growing asymmetry between the relative ease of sharing truth and lies that leads to ever growing incentives to do so. Because incentives are a powerful motivator of human behaviour this then propels new methods to make it even easier to share lies. Thus a negative feedback cycle is formed, one that could have exponential growth. This will eventually lead to deleterious consequences if left unchecked.</p>



<p>So why not realign the incentives? Why not fix this asymmetry? Why not make it easier to share the truth?</p>



<p>There are some downsides that come to mind though upon closer analysis these downsides could likely be significantly lessened through smart systems design to reduce potential for abuse, clear foresight to anticipate trouble, and a willingness to fix any problems that do come up transparently and honestly.</p>



<p>An example would be that making it easier to share the truth involves determining levels of trustworthiness among individuals and organizations. The common wisdom is that this is a fraught endeavor to undertake, yet we certainly do exactly this everyday. It is difficult to imagine that there is some fundamental limit preventing humans from scaling up and making concrete the informal trust systems we use everyday.</p>



<p>A derivative implication would be that a ‘score’ would have to be assigned to quickly tabulate and summarize trustworthiness. This is entirely a technical and logistical limitation of the current paradigms. It is not written in the stars that a ‘score’ must be the one and only way to compare trustworthiness in a real system.</p>



<p>A ‘score’ may be used as a stopgap measure, as a good enough solution i.e. credit scores, or for a variety of other reasons that may or may not be valid. There is nothing inherent about them that makes it the only possible end state of a trustworthiness system, or even more generally of any system whatsoever. Humans do not innately assign trust scores, in the everyday usage of the word, on some imaginary ranking like contest judges. </p>



<p>In mathematical and logical terms there may eventually have to be a ranking of some type to produce the attributes we would desire, I haven’t done the calculations yet to say either way. And philosophically, at a sufficiently advanced state of development it may indeed become ‘scoring’ of some type, if not through technical change at least through human change, since human tendency is to redefine words in more convenient ways as time progresses. Nonetheless, at this more advanced state of civilization there will be a greater capability to address the issues that would occur.</p>



<p>Of course technical limitations due to budget, software architecture, etc., may require some kind of ‘scoring’ somewhere along the way, and even if so a low score doesn’t represent any kind of metaphysical judgement. A number, of course, doesn’t fully describe a person and even though many use numbers to judge pro athletes that still is congruent with the fact that pro athletes are, usually, highly respected. Even in the worst case that low scores do carry some judgement it’s hard to imagine how that would be much more onerous than what already exists with low credit scores.</p>



<p>Thankfully there are more, and probably superior, ways of evaluation. For practical reasons trustworthiness has to be really easy to evaluate at a glance for the everyday use of such a method, remember the key idea is that it has to be easier than current methods and approach, if not exceed, the ease of spreading lies. </p>



<p>A better way might be through simplicity, to have two really broad categories as follows:</p>



<p>1. Verified</p>



<p>2. Not Verified</p>



<p>Yes, anything in the ‘Not Verified’ category could be ranging from totally false to mostly true with difficulties in verification. This is fine. A system like this is not meant to cater to everyone at the beginning. Trustworthiness in general isn’t everything, and keeping tabs on people and organizations in a database/blockchain/etc., which this will likely be at the beginning, is certainly a small subset of trustworthiness in general. </p>



<p>The beauty with this sort of simplicity is that one can simply at a glance see what’s verified or not without the need for a ‘score’. A real world working example of such a concept would be Twitter’s verified checkmark, which mostly accomplishes what it was originally envisioned to do.</p>



<p>Even better, the upsides for an easy to access, easy to use, and widely disseminated trustworthiness system are immense and, literally, too numerous to count.</p>



<p>The most obvious and perhaps greatest benefit is that honest behavior would be incentivized. Positive benefits would accrue from positive feedback loops of ever increasing trust. In economic language, ‘positive externalities’ would be generated, that although might not show up on a balance sheet would greatly improve the fabric of society.</p>

As powerful as it is, it is generally  taught at the pre-college level without much consideration on its<strong> underlying theory</strong> or its <strong>alternatives</strong>…</p><p>In this guide though, we’ll take a look at both of those, and delve into the different types of <strong>division procedures</strong> under the different scenarios. We’ll also try to illustrate their role in promoting a holistic understanding about division and numbers in general — through candid analysis and a wide range of examples.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Long-Division-Guide-for-Integers-Logo.png" alt="Definitive Higher Math Guide on Long Division for Integers — Logo" width="850" height="283" title="Long Division Guide for Integers Logo"></figure></div><p>(By the way, are you fairly acquainted with the content of this guide? If so, you might find this comprehensive <strong>summary worksheet</strong> both challenging and useful.)</p><span> </span><h2 id="terms"><span id="Euclidean_Division_%E2%80%94_Terminology"></span><a href="#toc">Euclidean Division — Terminology</a><span></span></h2><p> In arithmetic, we often like to express a number $n$ as chunks of another (non-zero) number $d$.  When that happens, we’re said to be dividing $n$ by $d$, where $n$ is known as the <strong>dividend</strong>, and $d$ the<strong> divisor.</strong></p><p> In general, given a dividend $n$ and a divisor $d$, we can express $n$ as $dq + r$ for some <em>integer</em> $q$ and some number $r$, and while $n$ can have many <strong>$dq+r$ representations</strong>, there is only one such representation where $ 0\le r &lt; |d|$.</p><p>In particular, in the case where the dividend and the divisor are <em>integers</em>, this result is known as the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Division Theorem (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division#Statement_of_the_theorem" target="_blank">Division Theorem</a></strong>, but even if they are not, the following still apply in general:</p><ul><li>$q$ — which is the unique <em>integer</em> in the above $dq+r$ representation — is known as the <strong>quotient</strong>.</li><li>$r$  — which is the unique number in the above $dq+r$ representation — is known as the <strong>remainder</strong>.</li><li>The act of finding those two numbers is called an <strong>Euclidean division</strong>, or more colloquially, <em>division with remainder</em>.</li></ul><div><p>In Case You’re Wondering…</p><p>The Division Theorem for integers is generally established by relying on the <strong>Well-Ordering Principle</strong>. For the general case, the <strong><a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Archimedean_Principle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Archimedean Property for real numbers</a> </strong>might be of help.</p></div><p>So what’s being implied here is that the dividend and the divisor are generally fixed numbers, while the <strong>interim quotients</strong>/<strong>remainders</strong> can change depending on the stage of the division we’re in. Furthermore:</p><ul><li>The equation $n=dq+r$ is known as the <strong>algebraic representation</strong> of the division.</li><li> The equation $\displaystyle \frac{n}{d} = q + \frac{r}{d}$ is known as the <strong>fractional representation</strong> of the division.</li></ul><p>(to be sure, there’s also the <strong>mixed fraction</strong> $\displaystyle q \, \frac{r}{d}$, though such notations are generally more prone to confusion when we move beyond the integers.)</p><p>And of course, there’s also the <strong>graphical representations</strong> of the division as well — which we’ll get into after some preliminary theory on division procedure.</p><h2 id="edptheory"><span id="Euclidean_Division_Procedure_%E2%80%94_Theory"></span><a href="#toc">Euclidean Division Procedure — Theory</a><span></span></h2><p> Of course, the Division Theorem is a neat piece of logic guaranteeing that in an Euclidean division scenario, the <strong>quotient</strong> and the <strong>remainder </strong>exist and are unique. However, it doesn’t offer us much clue as to how we should go about finding those numbers in practice…</p><p> But then, that’s precisely where the primary topic of our interest — <strong>Euclidean division procedure </strong> — comes into play.</p><p> In a nutshell, these are the finite, recursive procedures that seek to find the quotient and the remainder through <strong>iterated subtractions</strong>. They tend to operate by deducting the dividend repeatedly — usually in a series of <em>leaps</em> — until it becomes smaller than the divisor itself.</p><p>And when that happens, the process comes to an end — with the <strong>last interim quotient </strong>and <strong>remainder</strong> being the answers to the original Euclidean division.</p><p>Or more specifically:</p><ol><li>Given a dividend $n$ and a (non-zero) divisor $d$, we would begin the procedure by <strong>deducting</strong> $n$ (or its absolute value) by $d$ — an integer number of times (say $q_1$). This would lead to an interim remainder $r_1$, and the following interim algebraic representation of the division: \[ <br>n = d q_1 + r_1 \]</li><li> At this point, if $0 \le r_1 &lt; |d|$, then the division procedure is finished. If not, we would continue with the <strong>same process</strong> by deducting $r_1$ (or its absolute value) by $d$ — another integer number of times (say $q_2$). This would lead to the next interim remainder $r_2$, and the next algebraic representation of the division:  \[ n = d q_1 + d q_2 + r_2 \]</li><li> So as we go through the <strong>$i^{\text{th}}$ iteration</strong> of the division, we would obtain:<ul><li> The <strong>$i^{\text{th}}$-stage quotient </strong>$q_i$</li><li> The <strong>interim quotient</strong> $q_1 + \cdots + q_i$</li><li> The <strong>interim remainder</strong> $r_i$</li></ul></li><li> And if we choose the stage quotients judiciously so that the $|r_i|$ decreases by, say, at least $1$ at each stage, then after a <em>finite</em> number of iterations (say $m$), we’d be guaranteed to generate an <strong>interim remainder</strong> $r_m$ such that $0 \le r_m &lt; |d|$. And when that happens, our final algebraic representation would become: \begin{align*} <br>n &amp; = dq_1 + \cdots + dq_m + r_m \\ &amp; = d (q_1 + \cdots +q_m) + r_m  \end{align*} At which point, the division procedure would come to an end, yielding $q_1 + \cdots + q_m$ and $r_m$ as the <strong>quotient</strong> and the <strong>remainder</strong> of $n \div d$, respectively.</li></ol><p>Here, notice that whether $n$ and $d$ are integers or not, the interim quotients must be always kept as <strong>integers</strong> — and are the only ones among the $n$, $d$, $q$s, $r$s that must satisfy that requirement.</p><p>For this guide though, we’ll restrict ourselves to the cases where both $n$ and $d$ are integers, and look at the division methods and approaches that come out of those. These include the <strong>long/short division methods</strong>, the <strong> chunking methods,</strong> the <strong>freeform method </strong>— among other less graphical division approaches.</p><h2><span id="Integer_Division"></span><a href="#toc">Integer Division</a><span></span></h2><p>Since the concept of division has its basis on the natural numbers, it makes sense that we first start from there and illustrate some of the <strong>primary methods</strong> being involved. Once there, we’ll slowly expand our toolset with other alternate methods and approaches — so that other scenarios of integer divisions can be included as well.</p><h3><span id="Case_1_%E2%80%94_DigitBased_Methods"></span><a href="#toc">Case 1 — Digit-Based Methods</a><span></span></h3><p> If you have a tape that’s<strong> 1529 cm</strong> long and you want to cut it down into pieces of <strong>7cm chunks</strong>, how many of those pieces can you make? And after all is said and done, how much of the tape would remain?</p><p> Well, as you might guess, this is nothing more than the following <strong>division problem</strong>: \[ 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529} \] which can be solved by using the traditional <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="long division method (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division" target="_blank">long division method</a></strong>, or — if we prefer — the abbreviated <strong>short division method</strong> as well.</p><h4><span id="Long_Division"></span><a href="#toc">Long Division</a><span></span></h4><p>As you might already know, the long division procedure consists in setting up the division tableaus so that at each stage, we would be cranking out a digit of the <strong>quotient</strong> — by deducting the dividend/interim remainder by the largest number of times possible.</p><p>In this case for example, since $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $100$ times, but not $1000$ times, we know that we should begin the process by looking into the <strong>digit-multiples</strong> of $100$.</p><p>In fact, a bit of inspection would show that $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $200$ times, but not $300$ times. This would lead us to choose $200$ as our first <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which would in turn produce the following tableau: \begin{array}{r} 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em]   \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em]   129  \end{array} And here is the beauty about this approach: since we’ve already established that $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $200$ times, but not $300$ times, this means that we definitely won’t be further deducting $1529$ by $100$ times or more, and that all that remains is to focus at the <strong>digit-multiples</strong> of $10$ instead.</p><p>In fact, a little bit of inspection would show that $129$ — what remains now of $1529$ — can be deducted by $7$ $10$ times, but not $20$ times. This would lead us to choose $10$ as the next <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which in turn would lead to the following tableau:  \begin{array}{r} 10 \\[-0.35em] 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em]   \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em]   129 \\[-0.3em] \underline{\phantom{1}70} <br>\\[-0.25em] 59 \end{array} As you can see here, our notation is a bit unusual in that the numbers are being stacked up at the <strong>extremes</strong>, but those are there for a few reasons — which will become clearer in the next few sections.</p><p>But that aside, notice that since we’ve already established that what remained of $1529$ could be deducted by $7$ $10$ times, but not $20$ times, this means that we’ll definitely not be further deducting it by $10$ times or more — and that a deduction by a <strong>digit-multiple</strong> of $1$ should be our next step.</p><p>In fact, it doesn’t take a long time to realize that $59$ — what remains now of $1529$ — can be deducted by $7$ $8$ times, but not $9$ times. This would lead us to choose $8$ as our next <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which in turn would lead us to our next tableau: <br>\begin{array}{r} 8 \\[-0.35em] 10 \\[-0.35em] 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em]   \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em]   129 \\[-0.3em] \underline{\phantom{1}70} <br>\\[-0.25em] 59 \\[-0.3em] \underline{56} \\[-0.25em] 3 \end{array} Here, notice that since we’ve already established that what remained of $1529$ could be deducted $8$ times, but not $9$ times, it already followed by then that what <em>would</em> remain of $1529$ must be smaller than the <strong>divisor</strong> itself. In fact, this is reflected in our last tableau as well.</p><p>But either way, the division procedure is now coming to its end, yielding $200 + 10 + 8 = 218$ as the quotient, $3$ as the remainder, and the following <strong>representations</strong> of the division as well:</p><ul><li><strong>Algebraic representation</strong>:  $1529 = 7 (218) + 3$</li><li><strong>Fractional representation</strong>: $\displaystyle \frac{1529}{7} = 218 + \frac{3}{7}$</li></ul><h4><span id="Long_Division_Shorthands_%E2%80%94_Quotient_Merging_and_Omissions_of_Zeros"></span><a href="#toc">Long Division Shorthands — Quotient Merging and Omissions of Zeros</a><span></span></h4><p>Now, in the above example, there are two interesting peculiarities.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>It’s time for another Gleam release! This time as well as taking a look at
what’s new in the compiler, we’re going to take a look at what’s new in the
wider Gleam ecosystem too.</p>

<h2 id="record-update-syntax">Record update syntax</h2>

<p>Previously when we wanted to update some of the fields on the record we would
need to create a new instance and manually copy across the fields that have
not changed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>level_up</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>:</span> <span>Pokemon</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_level</span> <span>=</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.level</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_moves</span> <span>=</span> <span>moves_for</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span> <span>new_level</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Pokemon</span><span>(</span>
    <span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>new_level</span><span>,</span>
    <span>moves</span><span>:</span> <span>new_moves</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.name</span><span>,</span>
    <span>species</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span>
    <span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.item</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is quite verbose! Worse, it’s error prone and annoying to type every
time.</p>

<p>To remedy this problem <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton">Quinn Wilton</a> has
added the record update syntax to Gleam, so now we only need to specify the
fields that change.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>level_up</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>:</span> <span>Pokemon</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_level</span> <span>=</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.level</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_moves</span> <span>=</span> <span>moves_for</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span> <span>new_level</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Pokemon</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>pokemon</span><span>,</span> <span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>new_level</span><span>,</span> <span>moves</span><span>:</span> <span>new_moves</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All data in Gleam is immutable, so this syntax does not alter the values of
the existing record, instead it creates a new record with the original values
and the updated values.</p>

<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tomwhatmore">Tom Whatmore</a> has added some new features to
Gleam’s numbers.</p>

<p>There’s now syntaxes for binary, octal, and hexadecimal int literals.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// 4 ways of writing the int 15</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hexadecimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>0xF</span>
<span>let</span> <span>decimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>15</span>
<span>let</span> <span>octal</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>o17</span>
<span>let</span> <span>binary</span> <span>=</span> <span>0b00001111</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These might be handy in many situations such as when implementing
<a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/gleam-chip8">a virtual machine</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lpil/tetromino">a game of tetris</a> in Gleam.</p>

<p>Underscores can now be added to numbers, making larger numbers easier to read.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>billion</span> <span>=</span> <span>1_000_000_000</span>
<span>let</span> <span>trillion_and_change</span> <span>=</span> <span>1_000_000_000_000</span><span>.</span><span>57</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="type-holes">Type holes</h2>

<p>Type holes can be used to give partial annotations to values.</p>

<p>Here we’re saying that <code>x</code> is a List, but we’re not saying what type the list
contains, leaving the compiler to infer it.</p>



<p>This may be useful when adding annotations for documentation or to use a more
restrictive type than would be inferred by the compiler, as you can leave out
any parts of the annotation that are not important to you there.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-improvements">Compiler improvements</h2>

<p>The majority of the compiler work in this release has been improvements to
existing features.</p>

<p>The formatter style has been improved in several ways, and the performance of
the formatter has been improved. One popular change is to how it formats
assignments that don’t fit on a single line.</p>

<p>Much better!</p>

<p>Additionally several error messages have been improved to include more
information on how to fix the problem, and a whole bunch of bug have been
squashed. Please see the
<a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for
more detail.</p>

<h2 id="http">HTTP</h2>

<p>Outside of the compiler the big new thing in Gleam is the first release of
<a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http">Gleam HTTP</a>. Inspired by existing libraries such as Ruby’s Rack,
Elixir’s Raxx, and Haskell’s WAI, Gleam HTTP provides a single well-typed
interface for creating web applications and clients while keeping the
underlying HTTP client and server code modular.</p>

<p>In Gleam a HTTP service is a regular function that takes a HTTP request and
returns a HTTP response, where request and response are types defined by the
HTTP library.</p>

<h4 id="services">Services</h4>

<p>Here’s a simplistic service that echoes back any body sent to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>Request</span><span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>echo_service</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Request</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.response</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_resp_body</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.body</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a normal Gleam function it is easy to test this service, no special test
helpers or test server are required.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>should</span>
<span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>echo_test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>response</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.default_req</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_req_body</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>my_app</span><span>.service</span>

  <span>response</span><span>.status</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>should</span><span>.equal</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>

  <span>response</span><span>.body</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>should</span><span>.equal</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gleam’s HTTP library also provides middleware, which can be used to add
additional functionality to a HTTP service.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>bit_builder</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>middleware</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>service</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>my_app</span><span>.echo_service</span>
  <span>// Add a header</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.prepend_resp_header</span><span>(</span><span>"made-with"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Gleam"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>// Convert the response body type</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.map_resp_body</span><span>(</span><span>bit_builder</span><span>.from_bit_string</span><span>)</span>
  <span>// Support PATCH, PUT, and DELETE from browsers</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.method_override</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="running-a-service">Running a service</h4>

<p>Once we have defined a service we want to run the service with a web server so
that it can handle HTTP requests from the outside world. To do this we use a
HTTP server adapter, such as one for the <a href="https://github.com/elli-lib/elli">Elli Erlang web server</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>elli</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>elli</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>my_app</span><span>.service</span><span>,</span> <span>on_port</span><span>:</span> <span>4000</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or one for the <a href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy">Cowboy Erlang web server</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>cowboy</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>cowboy</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>my_app</span><span>.service</span><span>,</span> <span>on_port</span><span>:</span> <span>4000</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or even using the adapter for the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug">Elixir’s Plug interface</a>, so that a
Gleam HTTP service can be mounted within an Elixir Phoenix web application.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyAppWeb</span><span>.</span><span>UserController</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>MyAppWeb</span><span>,</span> <span>:controller</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>show</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>conn</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>GleamPlug</span><span>.</span><span>call_service</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>:my_app</span><span>.</span><span>service</span><span>/</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A list of all available server adapters can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http/#server-adapters">Gleam HTTP
project’s README</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to see more examples of Gleam HTTP being used to create a
web application see the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/example-echo-server">echo server</a> on GitHub. It
includes all the above as well as other concepts such as routing and logging.</p>

<h4 id="http-clients">HTTP clients</h4>

<p>HTTP services are only half the story! We also can use the HTTP library to
make out own requests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>httpc</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_my_ip</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>response</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.default_req</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_method</span><span>(</span><span>http</span><span>.Get</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_host</span><span>(</span><span>"api.ipify.org"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>httpc</span><span>.send</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>.body</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we’ve build a HTTP request and sent it using the <code>httpc</code> client adapter,
returning the response body if the request is successful.</p>

<p>A list of all available client adapters can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http/#client-adapters">Gleam HTTP
project’s README</a>.</p>

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed making it. I want to thank Micah for giving me the opportunity to learn from him and showcase his work to our community." -Leilany</p><h2 id="tell-us-a-bit-about-yourself-">Tell us a bit about yourself!</h2><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NnSAWn7UoXi8GS8REutxeE0cVfrnAae2YeqMWOGcj0Iw4DRaoSHUOTRyZLZl73ZEfujCiecwTzKOrdYzkEVZYkbcChPHZq4cJtksDXbfHbV6kafDilLX-A6kmLIIUw"></figure><p>Hello, my name is Micah Iverson. I am many things: Husband, Father, Designer, Developer, Entrepreneur, and Interior House Painter to name a few. My wife and I have been married since 2016 and have two boys (10 and 12). We live in Castle Rock Colorado, which is located about 30 minutes South of Denver. I am originally from Iowa, have lived in Minnesota, and of course now Colorado.</p><p>I have two degrees, one in design and another in 3D Animation. I have also studied computer science, photography, pottery, and grew up helping my dad build and remodel things. <em>(He is a carpenter/cabinet builder.)</em></p><p>In September of 2018, I stepped away from my design and development career and started my own interior house painting company which has continued to be extremely successful and continues to grow. In my free time, I focus on my own personal, digital products to relax and hopefully, one day will be my primary focus and revenue source.</p><h2 id="what-are-you-making">What are you making?</h2><p>As many people know, I make a lot of things, of which you can check out here: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.krazier.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1598466186406000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0RVfOCL3YgTIhIkAVAXbe8">https://www.krazier.com</a> but the one I spend a lot of my time on and has been growing the fastest is Retrospect. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.retrospect.team&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1598466186406000&amp;usg=AOvVaw18nsSYhG0Y9pINGNtWMKO0">https://www.retrospect.team</a></p><p>Retrospect is a real-time collaboration tool for retrospectives, tasks, and ideas.</p><h2 id="how-did-the-idea-for-your-product-come-to-mind">How did the idea for your product come to mind?</h2><p>I was working for a company a couple of years ago and we needed a tool to do retrospectives and the existing solutions we found were not designed well and didnâ€™t work all that great, not to mention the bigger solutions costing a lot of money to use for a relatively small need that we had. I set out to build a simple, affordable solution that looked good too.</p><h2 id="what-inspired-you-to-make-your-product">What inspired you to make your product?</h2><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wmkyhgs67HaZAalvciwqT6cj56V3OKmQQdK9SojC05r4XwoelQxx7YjFCk3t_Hst_HHV7-yXuXpD8FqWziizHUeAMW6T-BTTbfeGwVC8m2p-iNoaXEsFipWMuIoytQ"><figcaption>Retrospect.</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned above, it was originally out of necessity, but it is become a bit of a passion project to see just how far I can take it. With the Covid19 lockdown situation, this type of tool has only become more important for businesses to take advantage of.</p><p>Retrospect is purposefully â€œsimpleâ€�, we did not set out to make another Trello or Asana type of tool. Those tools are great and are a nice compliment to what we are building. One important focus for us has been â€œanonymityâ€� in the product. With Retrospectives, it is important to be able to provide critical feedback, it can be hard to do that if there is the potential for your co-workers to get upset with something you may have said. With Retrospect, everything you publish to a board is kept anonymous so that you can give that critical feedback without fear of retaliation.</p><p>Retrospect will always be affordable; we want this service to be approachable to as many people as possible while still being worth our time financially. We provide great pricing and a great solution and hope people will recognize that and find value in what we offer.</p><blockquote>I make because it is fun, I make because I know how, I love the challenge, the risk, and the huge potential it offers.</blockquote><h2 id="why-embark-on-the-maker-s-journey">Why embark on the makerâ€™s journey?</h2><p>I have always enjoyed building things, from Legos and plastic models to do-it-yourself projects around the house and of course digital designs and products. We live in a world that is very digital and very accessible for anyone to learn to design or code their own software. With tools like Makerlog, we can now share our progress, connect with other makers, and build things together. By nature, building software is often an â€œindividualâ€� thing to do, so having resources to connect with others makes the journey a lot more fun and open to learning from so many types of people.</p><p>A lot of people have a bit of an ambition to make something, whether it is art, electronics, gardening, woodworking, jewelry, or software. It is a way for us to get away from the day-to-day requirements in our lives and focus on something that we love to do without the stress of having to do it for anyone else. I make because it is fun, I make because I know how, I love the challenge, the risk, and the huge potential it offers.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-see-the-future-of-your-product">How do you see the future of your product?</h2><p>Retrospect has come a long way since the initial launch about two years ago, we have provided more permissions, more functionality, and improved the experience. The future has a lot of potential for new features and growth.</p><p>With the number of projects, I work on, I tend to push out a lot of smaller updates rather than huge feature releases. It is easier for us to manage and it also does not overwhelm our uses with huge UI changes that might make the tool unexpectedly harder for them to use.</p><p>As we continue to push out updates, our user audience will continue to expand. At first, our focus was on â€œretrospectivesâ€� which mostly development teams would find value in, the average person does not need a retrospective tool in their day-to-day lives. We are working towards making this a tool that has a useful impact on a daily level both professionally and personally. This means new types of functionality and a refreshed focus on our marketing and branding. Some of which will be happing over the coming weeks.</p><h2 id="as-of-today-what-are-your-stats">As of today, what are your stats?</h2><p>As of today, our stats areâ€¦</p><ul><li><strong>Users:</strong> 6,290</li><li><strong>Boards:</strong> 3,925</li><li><strong>Cards:</strong> 48,947</li><li><strong>Monthly Pageviews:</strong> 10K+</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $2K+ (We will be switching to a subscription model soon.)</li></ul><h2 id="how-do-you-use-makerlog">How do you use Makerlog?</h2><p>I post my daily updates but try to focus on important tasks rather than â€œI had a coffee todayâ€�, I do not want to spam the feed with things that are not important to know. I read most of the discussions and contribute when it makes sense.</p><p>I love Makerlog because it has allowed me to meet so many people that I never would have met any other way (other than maybe through Twitter). I feel like I have some lifelong friends despite having never met anyone in person, yet.</p><blockquote>I love Makerlog because it has allowed me to meet so many people that I never would have met any other way (other than maybe through Twitter).</blockquote><h2 id="what-are-the-biggest-challenges-of-being-a-maker">What are the biggest challenges of being a maker?</h2><p>The life of a maker is basically learning to deal with challenges daily, things you never would have thought you have to deal with. The bigger, more obvious challenges are lack of motivation, lack of revenue, and plain old fear.</p><p>Motivation, as makers we are by default motivated to work on things, that is what makes us a maker in the first place. The challenge comes into play when you have been working on something for a long time and it just feels like it will never be completed. There is always that â€œone more thingâ€� to do, person to reach out to, reason not to go live. When you do almost everything yourself, you simply get exhausted and lack of motivation is inevitable. Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s a bad thing, it just means you need to learn how to renew that motivation to push forward. For me I like to go to or watch movies, it is one easy way for me to reset my mind and get back into thigs. I also like to clean my desk or house, make a list of every task I have, and then work through the easy ones as fast as possible since lack of motivation often comes from knowing you should be doing something else so you end up doing nothing at all. If you can get the easy things done, then it helps you get motivated again.</p><p>Lack of revenue, this is a devastating challenge to a lot of people. We often see those â€œovernight successâ€� stories, that usually are not overnight. Though, these days we are seeing a lot of people who will literally build something one day and have a lot of success the next, the question is how long-term is that success? The obvious goal of being a maker is to generate revenue so you can get away from that 9-5 job, the unobvious issue is that it can take years to get enough revenue to do that. A lot of people do not realize this fact and give up too early and go back to what they were doing before. We also canâ€™t â€œdo it allâ€� so we often have to hire some pieces out, if you have no revenue, this becomes a big burden and can literally prevent you from even finishing your project.</p><p>Fear, people have a lot of fear in their minds. It is an important thing to be aware of and work on as being maker means dealing with a lot of unknowns. Fear is a good motivator though; it can force you to learn something faster than you thought possible. When I first started launching products, I was scared to death.

August 28, 2020 | https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/writing-labels.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/writing-labels.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>It has been a very productive and interesting journey creating Labcodes’ design system: there are always challenges and something new to learn. One thing we are doing is making sure we have our research and study references documented, alongside with the team's design choices, so we can have consistency throughout the components, and, mainly, a unison connection with our design principles. </p>
<p>One topic that always finds a way to catch my attention is the user interface short texts, and I was responsible, in our design system project, for the conception of the notifications, buttons and dropdown menu components. In common, they require guidelines and rules for writing its labels, in case of menu and buttons, and longer messages, for banners and toasts.</p>
<p>I remember that a long time ago, in the first versions of a mobile application that I don't remember which one, I read somewhere on the internet (sorry for the lack of references) about a change made to the interface: the term “my library” was set to “your library ”. OK! But what's interesting about that?</p>
<p>It was at that moment that the software began to communicate directly with its users. In the example, instead of considering the library as belonging to the system, the system now reports that the library belongs to the user. This change shows how short texts details change the reader's perception of a product. Below I will return to this subject.</p>
<h2>Writing labels</h2>
<p>Labels are commands applied to interface elements such as menus, tags, buttons, text inputs and other interface elements. They directly address users by communicating something or requesting an action. These commands are associated with interactive flows, normally change the system's state, and must be brief, informative and extremely clear. (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ui-copy/">adapted from n/n group</a>)</p>
<p><em>Each company has its own brand guide, which should present the tone and voices that the organization’s written communication should have. You can use it as a basis for writing according to how your company does it. Applying these rules, as well as other good writing practices, are a great path for good results. Here at Labcodes we have our own writing guide, which helps us a lot.</em></p>
<p>Following this reasoning, our design system's buttons have labels that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must communicate exactly what will happen when the user interacts with this component.</li>
<li>Only the first letter of the label's sentence is capitalized, as well as any other specific noun that requires capitalization.</li>
<li>They are as short as possible, preferably with a maximum of 3 words.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As difficult as it is to reduce actions labels to just 3 words, we chose to keep this rule as a </em>challenge in order to train our synthesis skills and communicate what really matters.*</p>
<p>For action menus we use some specific rules, but they are also applicable to buttons and other label categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use verbs and imperative phrases to describes the action triggered by the interaction. Never use verbs alone, always alongside a noun. For example: “Move item”, “Edit description”, “Get help". </li>
<li>Use nouns for actions that navigates to other pages (navigation actions/links). For example: “Keyboard shortcuts”, “Profile editor", “System settings”.</li>
<li>Don't use articles. They can complexify something that is simpler, increasing the length of a line, in addition to generating other unwanted effects. For example: write “Add bookmark” instead of “Add a bookmark”.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Let's take a step back to when I mentioned how short texts can change the perception of a product. Be aware when labeling system or user's owned items. A good example is to write “Your settings” instead of “My settings” since we are talking about user's preferences, that, even being stored by the system, they are still personal choices. This very naming choice shows attention to detail by making explicit product core values and showing who is in charge.</em></p>
<p><em>The dialogue between the system and its users must be direct, clear and friendly. When writing texts for interfaces, imagine the system as an experienced technical person talking to a non-technical person who needs to know what to do next, explaining a question in an understandable way, without making the experience dense or scary.</em></p>
<p>Something important to consider when writing button labels is the use of terms such as "Ok", "Yes", "No", "Finish", which does not have an explicit meaning for its triggered actions. It may be nice to spell out the actions that will be performed as the use of generic terms can cause difficulties in understanding or lead the user to take an action that they will regret.  </p>
<p>Most users typically press buttons or select actions without paying much attention to what they are doing. To avoid these inconveniences, in potentially destructive actions or that could cause an error, always provide a way to undo the action and use clear labels that help the user to recognize the options of "Undo", "Cancel", "Interrupt". In some cases, it may be useful to add a second confirmation layer to avoid data loss.</p>
<p><em>In common cases, there is simply not enough space in an application to accommodate commands with long labels, so, just repeating here the reminder to keep everything very simple. Consider it as a mantra and always ask yourself if it can be simplified further without losing clarity. Give preference to labels with only one line of text that contain up to 4 words.</em></p>
<h2>The design model for user interface texts</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/text-ui#a-design-model-for-ui-text">Microsoft has very interesting material on a design model for interface texts:</a></p>
<p>“As you think about UI text and its placement on your UI surfaces, consider these facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>During focused, immersive reading, people read in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order (in Western cultures).</li>
<li>When using software, users aren't immersed in the UI itself but in their work. Consequently, users don't read UI text, they scan it.</li>
<li>When scanning a window, users may appear to be reading text when in reality they are filtering it. They often don't truly comprehend the UI text unless they perceive the need to.</li>
<li>Within a window, different UI elements receive different levels of attention. Users tend to read control labels first, especially those that appear relevant to completing the task at hand. By contrast, users tend to read static text only when they think they need to.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“For a general design model, don't assume that users carefully read the text in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order. Rather, assume that users start by quickly scanning the whole window, then read UI text in roughly the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive controls in the center</li>
<li>The commit buttons</li>
<li>Interactive controls found elsewhere</li>
<li>Main instruction</li>
<li>Supplemental explanations</li>
<li>Window title</li>
<li>Other static text in main body</li>
<li>Footnotes”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should also assume that, once users decide what to do, they immediately stop reading any text and take action.</strong></p>
<h2>Moving forward</h2>
<p>Behavior, for me, is always something very fascinating that holds my attention. I always try, like our whole team, to produce content that is easy to understand.</p>
<p>Making available information clear is crucial to the decision-making process and guidance on interfaces, and in many cases the displayed information is scarce, garbled or the environment presents misplaced, wrong or contradictory messages, leading the user to fall back to more instinctive techniques such as trial and error, or luck.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered that the orientation process within an interface depends, in addition to its structure, on the way that texts and micro texts are written? In the next post, I will bring the lessons and our decisions to these short texts applied in notifications such as banners and toasts.</p>
<p>In the meantime, do you have any questions, suggestions or want to start a conversation? The comments section is open, and we want to know what you think and your experiences on writing for interfaces! See you soon :)</p>

<p>I’ve been using WordPress CMS for more than 10 years now. I’ve seen its evolution from a blogging platform to a fully featured website builder.</p>



<p>In December 2018, WordPress launched <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gutenberg</a> editor. The community, including myself, received it with mixed feelings.</p>



<p>On the one hand it looked like something innovative, intended to change the way users create and publish content, on the other hand it seemed like an incomplete tool trying to improve something that was already working great.</p>



<div><p>I’m now writing this post using <a href="https://wpindigo.com/wordpress-gutenberg-vs-elementor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gutenberg editor</a> and there is nothing particularly wrong with it. However, I sometimes find it difficult to use and confusing, even after using it on a daily basis. It simply doesn’t provide the user experience I’m used to.</p><p>Overall, I don’t like Gutenberg. Let me explain why. There are so many little things that simply don’t work as required. Here are a few examples:</p></div>



<ul><li><strong>The UI is not intuitive</strong>  – important controls are hidden, there are too many useless options, the icons are confusing and not representative. I don’t need spotlight mode, top toolbar, cog icons and other useless features.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1269" height="535" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons.png" alt="gutenberg confusing icons" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons.png 1269w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-300x126.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-1024x432.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-768x324.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1269px) 100vw, 1269px"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="605" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options.png" alt="gutenberg hidden options" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options.png 1436w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-300x126.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-1024x431.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-768x324.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>I don’t need the Edit/Select mode</strong> – in previous versions I could select the content from all blocks and copy or move them. Now I have to change the mode from Edit to Select and then I’ll be able to do the same thing. </li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1136" height="286" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options.png" alt="gutenberg edit-select options" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options.png 1136w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-300x76.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-1024x258.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-768x193.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>It’s not front-end editing</strong> – you add blocks in your back-end and preview them in the front-end. There is no way to edit blocks and other elements in the front end (except using the fullscreen mode which is not accurate).</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Block/pattern editing is a nightmare</strong> – if you’ve ever used <a href="https://elementor.com/?ref=13693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elementor</a> or any other decent page builder, you’ll understand what I mean. You can easily adjust a simple block like image or button, but when you have a more complex block, things get really complicated. It’s super hard to adjust elements and editing becomes a difficult task.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1427" height="621" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing.png" alt="gutenberg block-pattern editing" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing.png 1427w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-300x131.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-1024x446.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-768x334.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1427px) 100vw, 1427px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Embeds are useless</strong> – what’s the point to embed a Youtube video if you can’t adjust the width of the video or set up the autoplay option. You will anyway need to include the video via custom code.</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Images</strong> – you can’t simply drag and drop multiple images at once, as in Classic Editor. Now, you have to create a gallery, select your images, post the gallery and adjust the columns. Used to be simpler and more efficient.</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Issues</strong> – if something goes wrong, let’s say you create an HTML block and your code is not valid, WordPress will notify you and give you options to Resolve the issue. Why? I don’t need to convert this block, I just want to edit the HTML code, which is not possible without converting the block.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1143" height="581" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block.png" alt="gutenberg resolve block" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block.png 1143w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-300x152.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-1024x521.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-768x390.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1143px) 100vw, 1143px"></figure>



<p>I like changes, but why did they change something that was working really well? Looks like they are pushing this product further, without listening to the community and in my opinion it gets worse.</p>



<p>Thank God we have the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Classic Editor</a> and can use it for now. I hope that Gutenberg will improve and the team will make it more user friendly and easy to use. For now, I will never use it to create new pages or more complex layouts. I think that it’s way behind <a href="https://elementor.com/?ref=13693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elementor</a> and other page builders.</p>



<p>So, what do you think? Is Gutenberg a failure or a success? Please share your thoughts.</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/08/24/bcrypt-step-by-step/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/08/24/bcrypt-step-by-step/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Bcrypt is a <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">key derivation function</a>, which can be thought of as a slow <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function</a>. Its purpose is to <em>slowly</em> convert a piece of input data to a fixed-size, deterministic, and unpredictable output. A common use-case is to convert a password into an n-bit cryptographic key, which can then be used for safe authentication. </p>



<p>Here at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault,</a> we use Bcrypt in our security systems. Bcrypt is a very popular password hashing function, so much so that it’s the hash function we currently teach the implementation of in our <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Practical Cryptography</a> course.</p>



<h2>What Bcrypt Looks Like</h2>



<p>Using Bcrypt on the password <em>myPassword123</em> would produce something like the following:</p>



<pre><strong><em>myPassword123</em> </strong>-&gt;
$2y$12$vUw4OU4EAl4w4vC6/lA33OtDSYGhiIdekdT9iOoSs9/ckwrffaEui</pre>



<p>That output can be used to compare against future hashes against to see if the original data matches.</p>



<h2>Why not compare passwords directly?</h2>



<p>In web development,<em> </em>it is insecure to store user’s passwords in plain text. If an attacker were to gain access to the server’s database they could find raw email/password combinations and use them to attack the same users on other sites. </p>



<p>At the <em>very least</em> we must hash user’s passwords, but hash functions like <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-2</a> and MD5 are too fast to be secure. Using a KDF like Bcrypt provides security benefits over fast hashes because it is computationally expensive and slow. If an attacker gains access to a database of password hashes made with fast algorithms it is easy for them to “reverse” the hashes by guessing different inputs and seeing if the outputs match.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say the attacker finds the following entry in a database:</p>



<pre>user@gmail.com 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p>They can try hashing common passwords like:</p>



<pre>password1 -&gt;
0b14d501a594442a01c6859541bcb3e8164d183d32937b851835442f69d5c94e
password2 -&gt;
6cf615d5bcaac778352a8f1f3360d23f02f34ec182e259897fd6ce485d7870d4
password3 -&gt; 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p><br>The password, <code>password3</code>, produced a matching hash! Now the attacker knows that <code>user@gmail.com</code> is likely to use the password <code>password3</code> on other sites and can go hack other accounts. This is only possible because the attacker is able to quickly compute many hashes per second and guess millions of potential passwords.</p>



<p>A slow KDF like Bcrypt solves this problem.</p>



<h2>Bcrypt Output Format</h2>



<pre>$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy
\___/\__/\_____________________________/\___________________________________/
Alg   Cost                  Salt                                            Hash</pre>



<ul><li><code>2a</code>: The hash algorithm identifier (Bcrypt)</li><li><code>10</code>: Cost factor (2<sup><code>10</code></sup>&nbsp;= 1,024 rounds of key expansion)</li><li><code>N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMye</code>: 16-byte (128-bit) salt, base64 encoded to 22 characters</li><li><code>IjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy</code>: 24-byte (192-bit) hash, base64 encoded to 31 characters</li></ul>



<p>Direct from <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>



<h2>Bcrypt Explained Step by Step</h2>



<p>Bcrypt can be visualized with the following Go-like pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func bcrypt(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (hash string) {
	// Initialize Blowfish state with expensive key setup algorithm
	// This is the slow part of the algorithm
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes := expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost, salt, password)

	// Repeatedly encrypt the text "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt" 64 times
	// 24 bytes = three 64-bit blocks
	ctext := "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt"
	for i := 0; i &lt; 64; i++ {
		// Encrypt using standard Blowfish in ECB mode
		ctext = encryptECB(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, ctext)
	}

	// return the version, cost, salt, and ctext in the proper format
	return "$2a${cost}${salt}{ctext}"
}</code></pre>



<p>As you can see, Bcrypt depends heavily on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)" rel="noopener">Blowfish</a> cipher. Put simply, Bcrypt is an expensive key expansion coupled with Blowfish encryption.</p>



<p>The <code>expensiveBlowfishSetup</code> function can be understood by following pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">// pEighteenSubkeys: array of 18 subkeys
// sFourSubBoxes: Four substitution boxes
// Each S-Box is a 256-length array of uint32
func expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32) {
	// Initialize arrays
	pEighteenSubkeys := [18]uint32
	sFourSubBoxes := [4][256]uint32

	// Fill pEighteenSubkeys and sFourSubBoxes with the hex digits of pi 
	// This initial state works as in the original Blowfish algorithm
	// it populates the P-array and S-box entries with the fractional part of pi in hexadecimal
	pEighteenSubkeys = fillWithPi(pEighteenSubkeys)
	sFourSubBoxes = fillWithPi(sFourSubBoxes)

	// Permutate P and S based on the password and salt
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, salt, password)

	// This is the "Expensive" part of the "Expensive Key Setup"
	// Otherwise the key setup would be identical to Blowfish
	// Expand the key an exponentially increasing number of times
	// depending on the cost factor
	for i := 0; i &lt; math.Pow(2, cost); i++ {
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, password)
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, salt)
	}

	return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p><code>The expandKey function</code> is executed an exponentially increasing number of times depending on the value of the <code>cost</code> parameter. The <code>expandKey</code> function is explained by the following pseudo-code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (
	pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32
	) {

	// Mix password into the pEighteenSubkeys array
	// by XORing password with subkeys
	for i := 0; i &lt; 18; i++{
		// treat the password as cyclic, XOR 32 bit chunks of password with subkeys
		pEighteenSubkeys[i] ^= password[i % 18]
	}
 
   // Treat the 128-bit salt as two 64-bit halves 
   saltHalf[0] = salt[0:63]
   saltHalf[1] = salt[64:127]

   // Initialize an 8-byte (64-bit) buffer with all zeros.
   block := [8]byte

   // Mix internal state into P-boxes   
   for i := 0; i &lt; 9; i++ {
	  // XOR 64-bit block with a 64-bit salt half
	  // Each iteration alternating between saltHalf[0], and saltHalf[1]
      block ^= saltHalf[(i-1) mod 2]

	  // Encrypt block using current key schedule with blowfish block encryption
	  block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block)
	  
	  // Split block and use as new subkeys
      pEighteenSubkeys[2*i] = block[0:31]
	  pEighteenSubkeys[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
   }

   // Mix encrypted state into the internal S-boxes of state
   for i := 0; i &lt; 4; i ++ {
      for j := 0; j &lt; 127; j++ {
		// Encrypt block using blowfish block encryption
		// where salt[i] is 64 bit chunks
        block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block ^ salt[i])
        sFourSubBoxes[2*i] = block[0:31]
		sFourSubBoxes[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
	  }
	}
    return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p>It helps me to visualize the details of the pseudo-code by using a more “real” programming syntax like Go. If that doesn’t help you then take a look at the code on the <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Algorithm" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page here.</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/what-is-jamstack | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/what-is-jamstack">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The term JAMStack is meant to define a technology stack that relies heavily on JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It also is meant to mean a whole lot more than that. In this article, we will explore how this concept is being expressed on the web.</p>
<p>
<span>J</span>avaScript<br>
<span>A</span>PIs<br>
<span>M</span>arkup<br>
<span>Stack</span><br>
</p><p>You may be thinking to yourself, JavaScript, microservices exposed via APIs, and of course markup make up most websites these days. How is JAMStack not just describing the web in 2020? When you google "JAMStack" you may see an ad for a <a href="https://jamstack.io/">portable electric apm</a>, but you will also see a result for <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack.org</a>. JAMStack.org is a nice resource that the folks over at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> have created in order to help codify a set of standards around an emerging trend in how websites can be built. Let's begin with the first definition listed on JAMStack.org</p>
<p>
        <span>“</span>
        Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.
    </p>

<p>This statement does not do a great job of picking apart the JAM in JAMStack but does do a good job of leading with some value propositions, techniques, and specific technologies that are hallmarks of JAMStack. Let's pick this apart 2005 style with a tag cloud.</p>
<p><span>Fast</span>
    <span>CDN</span>
    <span>Secure</span>
    <span>Pre-rendering</span>
    <span>No servers</span>
    <span>Sites</span>
    <span>Apps</span>
</p>

<p>I have given what I believe to be the proper weight to each of these key words that help make up JAMStack, but before we dig into them, let's start from the beginning of sorts. Here is <a href="https://simple-jamstack.netlify.app/">an exmaple of a JAMStack site</a>.</p>


<p>This site simply takes the last 5 movie picks from the <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview">NYTimes Movies API</a>, renders them and adds an ability to vote on which films seem interesting and uninteresting via the <a href="https://formcake.com/api">Formcake API</a>. You could build this project in any number of stacks, but what makes this a JAMStack site? You can follow along in more detail using the public <a href="https://github.com/Formcake/simple-jamstack">repo</a>. Below we will go into some of these key aspects around JAMStack in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="pre-rending">Pre-rending</h2>
<p>One of the most important and talked about aspects of JAMStack is that projects are depoyed as static builds. It is a bit of a debate within the community on whether something must be statically built and hosted to be JAMStack but most JAMStack specific tooling is built around the idea of static builds. For those who are unfamiliar with this term, a static build simply means that a site or app is entirely or partially generated as flat files for serving. Those flat files are then returned to the user upon request as opposed to a server rendering them. The project could also be decribed as "Pre-rendered" since some or all of the site has been build ahead of time. When a change occurs to the content of a JAMStack site, you must rebuild it and serve the new flat files. A slice of a review website's static file structure may look like the following.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Url</th>
<th>Static File</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>/</td>
<td>index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies</td>
<td>/movies/index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies/reviews</td>
<td>/movies/reviews/index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies/reviews/tenet</td>
<td>/movies/reviews/tenet/index.html</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<pre><code>
index.html
movies/
    index.html
    reviews/
        index.html
        tenet/
            index.html

</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Formcake/simple-jamstack">sample movie interest project</a> utilizes pre-rendering with the help of <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. Eleventy is a fantastic way to get started with static sites because it is extremely flexible and can grow with your project.</p>
<h2 id="no-servers">No Servers</h2>
<p>Like the term serverless, this is a bit of a misnomer. Of course JAMStack sites are served by a server. The preferred server stack however is one that is specifically designed to only deliver static files like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a>. There are many benefits to be gained from taking this approach. One of those is stability. When you choose a system like S3 to host your website, you are making many concessions. You have no control over the operating system, the software installed on the server, or even the choice of http server technology. The benefit however is that none of those are of any concern when you are doing something as simple as serving a static file. All of those decisions and layers of complexity are manged and run at enourmous levels at scale by AWS. This makes it very unlikely that your site will go down because those layers of complexity can be highly optimized when used for one purpose. The sample project does not use a custom server because it is hosted on Netlify. Netlify is designed around hosting static files and therefore is highly optimized for this purpose.</p>
<h2 id="cdn">CDN</h2>
<p>The next layer of hosting for a JAMStack site is the use of a CDN. A CDN, or content delivery network, is a way of storing snapshots of the pages of your website and distributing those around the world. When a user requests a page your CDN will deliver a cache or vesion of that page instead of your main server. The main benefit of a CDN is that it is the <strong>fastest</strong> way to deliver content and the most <strong>secure</strong> way as well. CDN's can obscure your main server from the world and help protect it from malicious traffic or activity. The sample project utilizes a CDN because it is hosted on Netlify and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/">Netlify uses a CDN</a> to deliver deployed content.</p>
<h2 id="apis">APIs</h2>
<p>You may think that most websites are run via APIs these days and so why point this out. For JAMStack the importance on APIs centers around the fact that by default a JAMStack project does not have a web server to ping for data since a static hosting server is the only implied server in the stack. Many sites and most apps however need a server of some kind to create interactivity and store / access data. In the JAMStack world, it is encouraged that you either find a service with an API that performs an aspect that a server would or create a microservice using lambdas to still be as "serverless" as possible. Hosting platforms like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> both support server like features using lambda functions. In the example application, I kept it simple and used Formcake's API to handle all server side features.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/nytimes-form.png" alt="Creating your token in Formcake"></p>
<p>Formcake allows a form submission through an ajax request and so it was easy to utilize this functionality to allow users to vote on movie picks.</p>
<pre><code>
axios.post('https://api.formcake.com/api/form/4e656bac-5c16-4d5d-be65-eb2928be0179/submission', {
    vote, 
    movieTitle
});

</code></pre>

<p>I could have gone to the trouble of creating a lambda based micro service for the voting mechanic but for simple projects it is far easier to use something off the shelf. This is also part of the JAMStack ethos in a way. It's all about what is possible when you fully decouple the front and backend.</p>
<h2 id="sites-and-apps">Sites and Apps?</h2>
<p>JAMStack.org mentions that JAMStack can be used for both websites and web applications. I agree with this sentiment but I also think that JAMStack is not perfectly suited for many types of applications. If you were to signup for <a href="https://formcake.com/pricing">Formcake's free plan</a> you would notice that most pages load like a server side rendered application. If you go to your /forms page, you will instantly be greeted with your forms. The same is true for an individual form detail page and your account page. This is because we utilize <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">server side rendering technology</a> in order to deliver our site. We feel this to be a requirement for a SaaS application in 2020 because we are beyond the days of having loading wheels for every component on a single page application. It is a bit of an argument in the JAMStack community on whether an SSR application is a JAMStack project. I don't necessarily care because we should all be choosing the best technology for our projects but I feel that it is worth pointing out. This distinction makes JAMStack better suited for static content or sites with light interactivity in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this explanation of JAMStack is helpful to those looking to explore it. It has never been easier to create a powerful website with the pricipals behind JAMStack thanks to hosting platforms like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and tools like <a href="https://formcake.com/">Formcake</a>. As always, if you feel that your project could benefit from JAMStack but does not quite meet the requirements, simply take from JAMStack what improves the project and leave behind what detracts from it. This is how we built Formcake and we are very pleased with the results.</p>

      <div>
        <article>

  

  <div>
    <p>I’ve given this sort of pep talk to a bunch of newly joined womeng at Square, to the point where I’ve just decided to sit down and write all that stuff in one document. I’ll add a disclaimer that this is very engineering-focused, and may not apply to all other companies, but I think whether or not some of these things apply is indicative of the maturity level of HR/promotion processes at a company. With that said, let’s dive in.</p>

<p>The typical (but not only) background is for folks to come straight from an undergraduate program. Often this is their first full-time job, or first full-time job in tech, so it is critical to set expectations and guidance from the very start:</p>

<h3 id="know-your-current-level">Know your current level</h3>

<p>What level were you hired at? This should be easy to figure out through your HR portal. Sometimes this level is public to the whole company, sometimes it’s not. There is nothing preventing you from discussing your level with others. Your level defines your salary band and official title, which may or may not be also present in said HR portal.</p>

<p>Knowing where you are in your salary band is a generally good indicator of what the company initially expects of you. Lower in the band probably means you’re early in the level; mid-point means you’re performing on average; high in the band means they probably expect you to level up soon.</p>

<p>Titles are superfluous within a company, but are important for gaining a different job outside of the company. Titles may also be affected with ladders/tiers, and so if there is a slight difference between your title and your coworker’s title, you are likely on different ladders. Asking HR what these mean is always a good idea.</p>

<h3 id="find-your-career-ladder-document">Find your career ladder document</h3>

<p>A mature company should have career ladder documents and expectations for each level clearly posted, e.g. like <a href="https://developer.squareup.com/blog/squares-growth-framework-for-engineers-and-engineering-managers/">Square</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12h50IYqd7fsO7tJ0l1OuHYbz5vN2d24a8EIDFhu2AZQ/edit">has</a>. Once you know your level, it’s important to take a look at what the expectations are at your <em>current</em> level, and then what the expectations are at your <em>next</em> level. Many tech companies declare that they will promote you once you have demonstrated that you are performing at the next level. The way to meet those next level expectations is to then seek out opportunities that will allow you to demonstrate those skills.</p>

<h3 id="promotions-arent-automatic">Promotions aren’t automatic</h3>

<p>I think the most intimidating thing for folks who’ve never gone through a promotion process before, is figuring out when the right time to ask for a promotion is. If you are conflict-averse but a hard worker, you may happen to have a really good manager who just files a promotion for you with very little work on your part. Unfortunately this may make it harder to figure out when the right time for a promotion is later on!</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, different companies will have different paths for the employee who seeks a promotion. Some require the employee to put together the packet and present it to the manager who will forward it on. Others require the manager to put together the packet and forward it on. Yet even others might be extremely informal about the process. In all these cases, there’s generally a review panel, whether org-specific or company-wide, that will discuss review all the packets and approve who gets a promotion.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons why, in a steady-state, you may not “automatically” get a promotion. Your manager may be overworked, distracted, new, dealing with other situations and is simply forgetting about how promotions are important. It may be your manager hasn’t seen enough evidence from you and doesn’t feel confident about your case. It may be there are other more critically needed promotion packets that demand their attention.</p>

<p>In any of these cases, even if your manager is fully supportive of your case for promotion, you should assume that your manager doesn’t have 100% visibility to your work. Doing some upfront work whether it be familiarizing yourself with the promotion process, <a href="https://developer.squareup.com/blog/you-are-your-own-best-hype-person">making a hype doc</a>, or otherwise documenting clear evidence that supports traits for level+1, will all make your manager extremely grateful during the promo period.</p>

<h3 id="speaking-about-visibility">Speaking about visibility…</h3>

<p>I mentioned that there may be multiple reasons why your manager doesn’t feel they have seen enough evidence. A large chunk of that is visibility of not just accomplishments, but also problems of the employee. A good manager wants to know about both wins and struggles from the employee so that they can figure out how to make the situation better/provide advice.</p>

<p>One of the analogies I’ve made to several managers about their work is that they’re effectively playing a Real-Time Strategy game, e.g. say Starcraft. Their day-to-day is to figure out where the logistical and management problems are, solve those, to ensure they have efficient output. They are less concerned about the fact that they are out of Vespene gas, and more concerned about why they are out of it, what is the rate of Vespene gas usage, why was it drained suddenly, and how can they ensure that rate of use is consistent so they don’t run out again. In a game it’s easy to get visibility because lots of things show rates and metrics; in the real world, they have to rely on their reports being effective communicators of potential problems before they become actual problems.</p>

<p>I should add also that whenever I’ve made this analogy, a lot of managers chuckle and strongly agree.</p>

<h3 id="speaking-about-problems">Speaking about problems…</h3>

<p>Complaining about potential problems is okay; understanding, dissecting, and explaining how problems are affecting your work/timeline/time estimates is even better. The technique to becoming a senior engineer is not just solving harder/more complex problems; it’s being able to understand tradeoffs, potential risks to the project, and outlining possible solution avenues, ahead of time of roadblocks. This is something that only comes with practice and diligence. Coupled with effective communication, and now your manager feels confident enough to defer to you and be hands-off because you have control over the situation.</p>

<h3 id="becoming-senior-is-becoming-your-own-manager">Becoming senior is becoming your own manager</h3>

<p>There’s a reason why senior engineers often transition to full-time management, and it’s because of the assumption that they have been already doing this really well for their projects. (Whether they are actually ready to go into management is another question for another day). There is the implicit expectation that senior engineers are also good at project management, and this is often recorded as explicit line items in leveling documents, such as leading a team, facilitating discussion, estimating risk, being able to break down a large task into smaller tasks, etc. You will likely not succeed in a senior+ capacity if you do not take on rudimentary project management skills.</p>

<h3 id="write-things-down">Write things down</h3>

<p>It is hard to do things like, promotion evidence, project planning, root-cause analysis, trade-off analysis, etc. if things aren’t written down. The higher you go, the more complex problems become, and the easier it becomes to forget decisions made in Slack or verbally. Becoming an effective worker in tech really involves becoming an effective communicator, at the very least in a written medium. (There’s also a good reason to become an effective oral communicator, but I argue doing it in written form should be done first…. even though I’m personally not actually good at this). When things are written down, you spend less time rehashing decisions, and less time spinning wheels, and more time actually executing.</p>

<h3 id="starting-out">Starting out</h3>

<p>It may seem extremely daunting to figure out how to get to senior+ when you have just graduated from school. Start simple and easy; comment on design documents and code review by asking questions (asking questions is a good exercise in forces the author to re-explain, and if you can’t understand what they’re writing, you’re probably not the only one); question assumptions, especially to dig out historical decisions, thinking, or libraries; trust your manager/team when they give you a larger-ish project, and remember that executing a project is never a singular effort, but a team one, so leverage your team. Finally feel free to propose crazy ideas; sometimes people haven’t literally thought about that option, because the older you get, the crustier you get.</p>

<p>Once you get into the flow of things, I guarantee things will start falling into place.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>

<p>Just about everyone feels terrified in their first year at a workplace. This is a normal feeling. It will go away as you build confidence. Take note of other new hires that are senior, and watch as they make the same mistakes as you. The best senior hires are those who are honest upfront about how they don’t know everything, but are willing to learn with you and listen to you.</p>

<p>Good luck!!! and onward!!!</p>

<p id="7e60">Warren Buffet once advised investors to be “fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful”.&nbsp;Today, according to fund manager Guy De Blonay, eighty percent of daily moves in the U.S. are done by machines&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/sell-offs-could-be-down-to-machines-that-control-80percent-of-us-stocks-fund-manager-says.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(CNBC)</a>. Investors rarely face human competition anymore, therefore cannot benefit from the extortion of another’s fear or greed. </p>



<p id="7e60">Luckily, the market is a see-saw. It’s our job to be fearful or greedy, but we need pure logic to help us decide how to feel. This is where automating our stock analysis comes into play. When we leverage what our computers were built to do, it allows us to lean into our one asset that cannot be replaced: humanity. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“It’s no secret that machines are taking up a bigger and bigger share of investing, but the extent of their influence is approaching shocking proportions.”</p><cite>—<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/28/80percent-of-the-stock-market-is-now-on-autopilot.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC article</a></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p id="61e6">Below, I have outlined a coding process to completely automate daily algorithmic-based analysis. The goal is to deliver the day’s top-10 highest and lowest stock options right to your inbox. Automating this analysis process allows lone investors more time to reason through sentiment. Which in turn, gives them an advantage over the increasingly robotic trading in today’s market.</p>

<h2 id="16bb">Beginner-Level Python</h2>



<p id="bc40">In an effort to make this automation process doable for people with little to no programming experience, I will review the code from top to bottom. Pay extra attention to the comments in the code below to gain a better understanding of the what each line of code does. </p>



<p id="bc40">If you are completely new to Python, I recommend reading&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/install-python" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a>&nbsp;for a simple walk-through of the installation and startup process. </p>

<h3 id="0a66">Importing Necessary Libraries</h3>



<p id="29d1">In order to make use of existing functions when automating our stock analysis, we must first import the necessary libraries. We can do this with a couple simple lines of code.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code># Necessary Libraries
import yfinance as yf, pandas as pd, shutil, os, time, glob, smtplib, ssl
from get_all_tickers import get_tickers as gt</code></pre></div>



<p id="cdc7">Here is a breakdown of the use-case for each library:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yfinance</a>: Gather historical/ relevant data on each stock.</li><li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandas</a>: Work with large sets of data.</li><li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shutil</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glob</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OS</a>: Accessing folders/files on the computer.</li><li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time</a>: Forcing the program to pause for a period of time.</li><li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smtplib&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SSL</a>: Sending a report over email.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Get_All_Tickers</a>: Filter through all stocks to get the list you desire.</li></ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="153a">Collecting Historical Stock Data</h3>



<p id="297a">Obtaining historical data on the stocks that we want to observe is a two-step process. First, we must narrow down a list of stocks. Then, we have to make individual calls to the&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yfinance API</a>&nbsp;in order to import data about each company.</p>



<h4 id="d7c2">Choosing the Stocks We Want to Target</h4>



<p id="c120">The library&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get-all-tickers</a>&nbsp;allows us to compile a list of the stocks that fit the criteria we set. Currently, the library supports filtering stocks by their region, sector, market cap, and exchange.&nbsp;For this example I am looking at companies that have a market cap between $150,000 and $10,000,000 (in millions). You will notice that I also included a line of code to print the number of tickers we are using. This is very important. You will need to be sure that you are not targeting more than 2,000 tickers, because&nbsp;the Yfinance API has a 2,000 API calls per hour limit.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code># List of the stocks we are interested in analyzing. At the time of writing this, it narrows the list of stocks down to 44. If you have a list of your own you would like to use just create a new list instead of using this, for example: tickers = ["FB", "AMZN", ...] 
tickers = gt.get_tickers_filtered(mktcap_min=150000, mktcap_max=10000000)
# Check that the amount of tickers isn't more than 1800
print("The amount of stocks chosen to observe: " + str(len(tickers)))</code></pre></div>



<p id="f069">I would recommend using this library because it allows for our list of observable stocks to be dynamic. But, I also provided an alternative line of code that allows you to type in the stocks you would like to have the program analyze.</p>



<h4 id="9545">Obtaining and Saving Historical Data</h4>



<p id="7f79">Utilizing the&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yfinance API</a>, we will be able to access and save the historical stock data for every element (stock) in our “tickers” list. This library gives us access to the data Yahoo Finance provides for free to the public. If you’re looking for other information about a stock (not historical data), check out&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their API</a>.</p>



<p id="00ba">The code below will cycle through our list of stocks obtained in the section above. For each stock it will make a call to Yahoo Finance to obtain its historical data. </p>



<p id="00ba">If it fails it will retry up to five times for each stock or until it has made 1,800 API calls. Afterwards, when it successfully retrieves the data from Yahoo Finance, it will save it as an individual CSV file in the folder called “Stocks”.  </p>



<p id="00ba">Lastly, every time the code runs it will remove and recreate the folder “Stocks”. This is done to ensure that it is not considering data from the previous day in its analysis.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code># These two lines remove the Stocks folder and then recreate it in order to remove old stocks.
shutil.rmtree("&lt;Your Path&gt;\\Daily_Stock_Report\\Stocks\\")
os.mkdir("&lt;Your Path&gt;\\Daily_Stock_Report\\Stocks\\")
# Holds the amount of API calls we executed
Amount_of_API_Calls = 0
# This while loop is reponsible for storing the historical data for each ticker in our list. Note that yahoo finance sometimes incurs json.decode errors and because of this we are sleeping for 2 seconds after each iteration, also if a call fails we are going to try to execute it again. Also, do not make more than 2,000 calls per hour or 48,000 calls per day or Yahoo Finance may block your IP. The clause "(Amount_of_API_Calls &lt; 1800)" below will stop the loop from making too many calls to the yfinance API.Prepare for this loop to take some time. It is pausing for 2 seconds after importing each stock.
Stock_Failure = 0  # Used to make sure we don't waste too many API calls on one Stock ticker that could be having issues
Stocks_Not_Imported = 0
# Used to iterate through our list of tickers
i=0
while (i &lt; len(tickers)) and (Amount_of_API_Calls &lt; 1800):
    try:
        stock = tickers[i]  # Gets the current stock ticker
        temp = yf.Ticker(str(stock))
        Hist_data = temp.history(period="max")  # Tells yfinance what kind of data we want about this stock (In this example, all of the historical data)
        Hist_data.to_csv("&lt;Your Path&gt;\\Daily_Stock_Report\\Stocks\\"+stock+".csv")  # Saves the historical data in csv format for further processing later
        time.sleep(2)  # Pauses the loop for two seconds so we don't cause issues with Yahoo Finance's backend operations
        Amount_of_API_Calls += 1 
        Stock_Failure = 0
        i += 1  # Iteration to the next ticker
    except ValueError:
        print("Yahoo Finance Backend Error, Attempting to Fix")  # An error occured on Yahoo Finance's backend. We will attempt to retreive the data again
        if Stock_Failure &gt; 5:  # Move on to the next ticker if the current ticker fails more than 5 times
            i+=1
            Stocks_Not_Imported += 1
        Amount_of_API_Calls += 1
        Stock_Failure += 1
print("The amount of stocks we successfully imported: " + str(i - Stocks_Not_Imported))</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="59e4">Performing Stock Analysis</h3>



<blockquote><p>Choosing a model for your data is a lot like making dinner, you’re really hungry, but you have no idea how to cook. Whatever kind of analysis you are looking to incorporate into this program, perfecting that recipe takes time and I wish you the best of luck. </p><cite>— Me writing this while hungry</cite></blockquote>



<p id="91cd">This section provides an example of how you can utilize this program to save time in your analysis process. Since the “analysis process” is different for every investor, I won’t spend too much time focusing on&nbsp;<strong>my</strong>&nbsp;analysis here. If you are interested in implementing other analysis techniques in Python, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-calculate-the-accuracy-of-the-macd-using-python-bbb8171b2255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a>&nbsp;article on how to calculate the MACD and its accuracy.</p>



<p id="ca68">The on-balance volume technical indicator that I am calculating in my analysis is used to relate the volume and price of a stock. It is a relatively simple calculation. First, you decide the amount of time that you want to observe the stock. I chose to look at the last ten days of data for each stock. If the day’s opening price for a company is higher than its closing price it will add the days volume to the total. If it’s less, the volume is subtracted from the total. By the end of the ten days you have a picture of each stocks cumulative volume.</p>



<p id="f669">In order to better compare each stock I’m also normalizing the volume before adding or subtracting it. The last step in this process is to create a CSV of all of the stocks ranked by their OBV value. This is important, as it is the information that is included in the report to be emailed every morning.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="Python"><code># OBV Analysis, feel free to replace this section with your own analysis -------------------------------------------------------------------------
list_files = (glob.glob("&lt;Your Path&gt;\\Daily_Stock_Report\\Stocks\\*.csv")) # Creates a list of all csv filenames in the stocks folder
new_data = [] #  This will be a 2D array to hold our stock name and OBV score
interval = 0  # Used for iteration
while interval &lt; len(list_files):
    Data = pd.read_csv(list_files[interval]).tail(10)  # Gets the last 10 days of trading for the current stock in iteration
    pos_move = []  # List of days that the stock price increased
    neg_move = []  # List of days that the stock price increased
    OBV_Value = 0  # Sets the initial OBV_Value to zero
    count = 0
    while (count &lt; 10):  # 10 because we are looking at the last 10 trading days
        if …</code></pre></div></div></section></div></article></div>

<p><em>This is a series of notes on colour search design based on my experiences
desgining search interfaces for the lipstick search engine <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a>.
I will link other parts of the series here as they become available.</em></p>

<h2 id="simple-yet-flexible-the-design-of-the-query-page">Simple yet flexible: the design of the query page</h2>

<p>The initial design of the <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a> search interface drew heavy inspiration
from the relative minimalism of the Google search engine front page, which
has a graphic, a search box and a few buttons as the main features.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/Lipcolourmatch_PP_3.png" alt="Google Search Engine"></p>

<p><em>The design of Google’s text-based search engine is minimal.</em></p>

<p>However, one of the reasons that such a scarcity of elements works for Google’s usecase
is that text search is a good deal more simple than the search interface of a
niche colour search engine. Not only does the UI designer need to provide a suitable
UI element for choosing colours, this UI element also needs to account for the various textural
subtleties that a user may desire to search for.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/duckduckgo-search-bar.gif" alt="DuckDuckGo"></p>

<p><em>DuckDuckGo features a minimal search bar.</em></p>

<p>In the case of lipcolours, a product has variation not only in the shade, but also in the finish.
The same colour can appear as metallic (the formula has a added element for high shine and reflectivity), shimmer (the formula is shiny with tiny sparkles), cream (not as shiny as metallic, but more reflective than matte) and matte, which is usually the most pigmented and least reflective form a lipcolour. These variations in texture need to be taken into account in the search query.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/lipglossdemo.gif" alt="Lipgloss"></p>

<p><em>Searching for a lipgloss in a particular shade on <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a></em></p>

<p>To capture this complexity (the solution described here is not perfect by any means and will certainly require more iterations), the initial colour search UI design for <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a> featured
a colour wheel selector powered by the open source library iro.js and a drop down
control for adding desired finish and product type filters. For example, one could, if
desired search for lipstick and liquid lipstick products in a matte navy blue colour.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/navyblue.gif" alt="Navyblue"></p>

<p><em>Searching for navy blue lipsticks and liquid lips in a matter finish.</em></p>

<h2 id="displaying-the-search-results">Displaying the search results</h2>

<p>The next important step in the design of a colour search engine is the format of
the results. The initial inspiration was once again drawn from the world
of text based search engines where web pages that best match a user’s query are listed
in descending order.  Some search engines like Google paginate the results, while
others like DuckDuckGo offer an infinite-scroll-lazy-loading experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/google-pagination.png" alt="Paginated search results from Google"></p>

<p><em>UI design for paginating search results on Google</em></p>

<p>As the user scrolls down, the backend returns more and more results.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/duckduckgo-pagination.gif" alt="DuckDuckGo pagination"></p>

<p><em>DuckDuckGo pagination is an infinite-scroll.</em></p>

<p>In addition to the results, the results pages of search engines usually also
display the original query, to help the user see what they searched for and how well what they found
with the help fo the search engine matches what they searched for.</p>

<p>The initial design of the colour search engine results followed the template above fairly closely.
The results page features a “You searched for” section that shows a coloured circle featuring the
colour the user chose from the colour wheel on the main page and then a list of results in a
descending similarity order. The closest colours (according to the colour search engines similarity metric) are listed first.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/searchresults.png" alt="Search resuslts"></p>

<p><em>Search results from the colour search engine feature the original query, the results in descending order of colour similarity as well as small cards with information.</em></p>

<p>Each search result is displayed with a small card that has a circular colour element that captures the colour of the product. In addition, each card has information about the brand, the product type and the finish.</p>

<h2 id="grid-like-results-to-facilitate-comparison">Grid-like results to facilitate comparison</h2>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/Lipcolourmatch_PP_4.png" alt="Results comparison"></p>

<p><em>One key task a user wants to do is to compare the results with the query. This is farily simple with a text search engine but harder when the query is a colour.</em></p>

<p>One of the main tasks that a user is interested in doing is comparing
the colour in the search query to the colour of the items
returned in the results to see how close the matches are to the query.
Thinking back to the results page of traditional text-based
web search engines, we can see that the pagination design (whether it’s
a traditional pagination UI or an infinitely scrolling UI) does not
interfere with the process of comparison that a user engages in.
We take the query we entered into the search engine and then scan
the results checking which one could potentially have useful
information related to the query. It’s relatively easy to keep
a text query in mind, so the paginated approach does not pose
a major hindrance to the user’s goal of comparing the query to the results.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/mac-chili-pages.gif" alt="Mac Chili Paginated"></p>

<p><em>Paginated search results from the colour search engine. Keeping the exact query colour in mind and paginating to compare results can be hard.</em></p>

<p>However, keeping the exact shade of a colour (the colour in the query) in your mind and then scrolling
or paginating through each result card and comparing the colours is challenging.
You can see for yourself in the animated screencapture above.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/mac-chili-grid.gif" alt="Mac Chili Grid"></p>

<p><em>A grid design facilitates colour comparison.</em></p>

<p>One solution for this would be to dock the “You searched for” card at the top
of the screen while scrolling and thus facilitate quick and easy side by side
comparison. However, for the time being implementing this with the Bootstrap
framework proved too difficult, so instead I’ve opted for implementing a grid
of results with a side by side card arrangement that displays the queried
colour on the left and allows the user to populate the card on the right
with a search result from the grid.</p>

<p>I will be iterating more on this design in the near future and look forward
to sharing what I learn with you!

<p>With others, I am working on formally specifying and verifying filesystems (eg SibylFS). I am also working on a verified filesystem implementation called “ImpFS”.</p>
<h2 id="impfs">ImpFS</h2>
<p>ImpFS is a new filesystem based on B-trees and persistent logs. The main “management” page (with links to all the subproject etc) is here: <a href="https://tomjridge.github.io/ocamldocs/">https://tomjridge.github.io/ocamldocs/</a></p>

<p>SibylFS is a formal model of POSIX-like and real-world filesystems, and simultaneously a test oracle which can be used to check real-world traces of filesystem behaviour. The main page for SibylFS is <a href="http://www.tom-ridge.com/sibylfs.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Google is an evil company. When they're not <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/11/google-facebook-surveillance-privacy/">surveilling billions of people</a>, they're <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/08/13/google-resumes-its-senseless-attack-on-the-url-bar-hides-full-addresses-on-chrome-canary/">trying to harm the web</a> or <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-25/google-fires-four-employees-citing-data-security-violations">firing employees for organizing</a>. My <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/full-stack-ethics">first entry on this blog</a> was about reasons to avoid Google products. I don't like Google!</p>
<p>The thing is, Google is everywhere, and Google is free. It's probably not much of an exaggeration to say that everyone who spends time online has used a Google service. In a lot of cases, they're the default option that people choose without thinking. At some point, I just decided to stop. No more Google in my life.</p>
<p>Is that even possible in 2020? Mostly!</p>
<p>Some Google services are easily replaced. Others are difficult because of network effects, and still others just don’t seem to have any good competitors that I’ve found.</p>
<p>So here are all the Google services I used to use, how easy it is to avoid them and what I use instead.</p>
<h3 id="google-search">Google search</h3>
<p>I thought this one would be okay, since it’s a big target. The most promising competitor here seems to be <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, but ultimately I’ve been disappointed by their search results. They're fine for easy queries, like if I type the exact name of what I’m searching for. More complex queries — for example, pasting an error message from my terminal — are not great. DuckDuckGo make it easy to search Google by prefixing a query with <code>g!</code>, which I end up doing far too often.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: medium</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-chrome">Google Chrome</h3>
<p>If you've written it off in the past, you should revisit <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>. It's fast, its developer tools are great and it aggressively blocks trackers and advertisers. As of writing this, it's blocked 339 trackers for me today.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363424/mozilla-layoffs-quarter-staff-250-people-new-revenue-focus">Mozilla's recent layoffs</a> — including their <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveALee/status/1293487542382333952">developer tools team</a> — are worrying. If Firefox starts going downhill again, I'll probably switch to Safari. That would suck, though — Firefox is the last major bastion against the Webkit/Blink browser engine monoculture.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="android">Android</h3>
<p>I use an iPhone, so no problems here!</p>
<p>This might be a good time to mention that I have <a href="https://itep.org/fact-sheet-apple-and-tax-avoidance/">qualms</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-apple-china-catcher-20180116-story.html">with</a> <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/184283/why-third-party-browsers-will-always-be-inferior-to-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/">Apple</a>, too — but they seem to be the least worst of the two real choices for a cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="gmail">Gmail</h3>
<p>There are a million and one email services, so I wasn’t expecting too much trouble with this one. Partially because my email address is <code>@jake.nyc</code>, not <code>@gmail.com</code>, so there was no annoying transition where everyone had to update their contact info.</p>
<p>I went with <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> ($50 per year on their annual plan) and I have no complaints. It was super easy to import all my emails from Gmail. The webmail and phone apps are both good — although because my work uses Gmail, I use <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/">Spark</a> in order to have all my email accounts in one app.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-calendar">Google Calendar</h3>
<p>Fastmail email accounts come with a calendar, and it's interoperable with Google calendars. Or they're both compatible with some open standard; I'm not a calendar power user. Whatever the case, it works fine.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-maps">Google Maps</h3>
<p>After the disastrous Apple Maps rollout, I was worried that this would be a tough one to replace. Not so! If you have an iPhone, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/">Apple Maps</a> gives you everything you want in a maps app. And their maps have <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps-continental-united-states">gotten really good</a>. I'm happy to report that you can leave those fears in 2012.</p>
<p>If you're a city dweller like I am, there's an even better option: <a href="https://citymapper.com/">CityMapper</a>, which focuses specifically on public transit. They also have real-time transit alerts and offline maps. I use CityMapper whenever I'm taking public transit, and Apple Maps on the rarer occasion that I'm driving somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-docs">Google Docs</h3>
<p>The only two of these I really use are Docs and Sheets. I’m mostly able to cover everything with a combination of tools: <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> for prose, <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> for general note-taking and <a href="https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/">Soulver</a> for math related stuff. I would like to find a good full–featured spreadsheet replacement but so far that hasn’t been a huge obstacle.</p>
<p>The real issue is that I often use documents and spreadsheets with other people. And unfortunately, Google has built a nice little walled garden here. There's no easy way for me to collaborate with someone else without forcing them to also forego Google Docs. On top of that, other services build on top of Google's products. I use <a href="https://www.tillerhq.com/">Tiller</a> to stay on top of my spending, but they only support importing data into Google Sheets and Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: hard</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h3>
<p>This is basically the same story as Google Docs, with the caveat that it's much less common for me to need a shared filesystem with someone. I use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> for myself, which usually suffices when I need to share a file. That said, it's still part of the same ecosystem as Google Docs, which makes it hard to avoid if you use the former.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: medium</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Privacy conscious analytics services seem to be <em>en vogue</em> these days, so it wasn’t difficult to find a replacement I liked. I picked <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a> and have been very happy with it. It’s $14 a month and you can put it on as many websites as you want; I have it powering both this site and <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a>.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of obscure metrics Google Analytics gives you that Fathom doesn’t have, but I’ve never missed them. Maybe I would if I were really into marketing data. But pageviews, uniques, referrers, time on site and bounce rate is enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>
<p>This one is a little weird, since the differentiating factor between YouTube and competitors is content rather than a set of features. I'm not a big YouTube user so it doesn’t bother me too much, but if someone sends me a video there’s basically no way for me to see it elsewhere.</p>
<p>I’m rating this one “hard” because it’s basically irreplaceable, but as someone who doesn’t watch many YouTube videos anyway it doesn’t really affect me. Your mileage may vary!</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: hard</strong></p>

<p>Everything we create and share online depends on digital technology. Digital writing tools such as personal computers and word processing software get a lot of attention in magazines, blogs, and videos. Writing about these complex and expensive tools is a huge industry. </p>



<p>Old-fashioned analog writing depends on relatively primitive technology, and it remains important in daily life. For example, we make shopping lists, post reminders on refrigerator doors, and sometimes keep handwritten diaries or journals. When I am walking outdoors or sitting in a coffee shop, I often record my ideas in paper notebooks. Many of my best ideas and deepest insights have first appeared on paper.</p>



<p>Analog writing tools are not expensive, and they do not become obsolete. They get much less attention than aggressively marketed digital hardware and software; nevertheless, analog writing technology continues to improve in a competitive market. We can find many detailed reviews of  stationery products and serious discussions about the “best” tools for various kinds of writing.</p>



<h2 id="digitalvs.analogwriting"><span id="digital_vs_analog_texts"></span>Digital vs. analog texts<span></span></h2>



<p><em>Digital texts</em> are not physical objects. We can access texts only when they are rendered into perceivable objects such as pixels on a computer display, printed ink on paper, tactile patterns on Braille readers, audio output from speech readers, etc. This characteristic of digital text enables people to communicate through writing in various forms, regardless of time, space, and limitations of perception. </p>



<p><em>Analog texts</em> are created with kinetic energy applied to physical objects, for example, by pressing ends of sticks into clay tablets, chiseling away portions of stone, or applying ink to paper with a brush. Regardless of media, analog texts are material objects that we can directly perceive and manipulate.</p>



<h2 id="digitalvs.analogwriting"><span id="digital_vs_analog_writing"></span>Digital vs. analog writing<span></span></h2>



<p><em>Digital writin</em>g enables efficient modification, transfer from one place to another and one medium to another, transformation into various formats, and storage for local and networked access. Nearly all of my writing is digital, usually input with a pain text editor on either a small laptop computer or a workstation with a large display. When necessary I write with an Apple iPad or iPhone, which I find slow and frustrating. </p>



<p><em>Analog writing</em> applies ink, graphite, etc. to a surface, usually paper. Editing is difficult unless extra space is added between lines, as in a double-spaced manuscript for an academic paper.</p>



<p>I grew up in an analog world. With poor grades in penmanship, I struggled to make my handwritten work legible. I did all of my formal writing with a typewriter until I was well into my professional career. </p>



<p>As the world became increasingly digital, I embraced new technologies as an “early adopter” and even taught digital writing and text processing to university students. Nevertheless, analog tools for handwriting very are useful, even liberating in some situations. I carry one or two notebooks wherever I go.</p>

<h3 id="journalnotebooka5">Journal notebook (A5) &amp; pen</h3>



<p>I use a journal notebook for several purposes. First, I log sequences of events that I experience or observe. Second, I take notes of meetings, lectures, etc. Third, I keep a journal for free writing, e.g., illustrations of ideas, observations, insights, text fragments for essays, and sometimes even poetry. I date each entry and sometimes record my location. I have tried digital tools for each of these purposes, but paper notebooks are more convenient. For many years I used B5 spiral notebooks, but now I prefer smaller and more portable A5 notebooks.</p>

<h3 id="weatherproofpocketnotebookforoutdoors">Weatherproof pocket notebook &amp; mechanical pencil</h3>



<p>When I go outdoors, usually with a camera, I carry a small weatherproof notebook for field notes. It is also useful for sharing information with people I meet. For example, I can write the URL of my blog, rip out that page, and give it to someone. Likewise, someone else can write directly in my notebook to give me, for example, an email address or the name of a good coffee shop.</p>

<h2><span id="the_pleasures_of_analog_writing"></span>The <strong>pleasure</strong>s of analog writing<span></span></h2>



<p>Analog writing gives me pleasure and satisfaction beyond its mundane usefulness. The act of writing brings out ideas and ways of expressing them in words that seem more spontaneous than when I write write with digital tools. Reviewing past entries is very informative. I can easily flip through journals that I filled last year or 20 years ago. Finally, selecting paper and writing instruments is a satisfying and low-cost activity. Stationery shops offer a brief respite from the pressures of life.</p>

<p>I’ve been working with Amazon Web Services for 6 years or so, and though the cloud has changed a lot in that time, one thing has remained consistent: <strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a core pillar of a healthy implementation of AWS.</strong></p>



<p>For anything bigger than a toy cloud application, IaC is table stakes. You’d be hard-pressed to find someone managing anything of scale who thinks letting folks point and click in the console is the optimal route.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>These days, I actually find it faster to just start with all of my applications or even proof-of-concept with an IaC tool and go from there. I, time and time again, have found it easier to return to projects weeks or months later and quickly be able to understand how things work from a familiar baseline and context. I don’t have to rebuild in my mind exactly what I was thinking from scratch.</p>



<p>The “how” of how one approaches IaC is, of course, AWS engineers’ very own version of the old “tabs vs spaces” debate. </p>



<p>So what IAC tools are available to you in AWS, and how do you choose between them?</p>



<h2>AWS CloudFormation</h2>



<p>CloudFormation (CFN) is the original IaC tool for AWS, released in 2011. I have come to respect, hate, love, and revere its power to describe and manage infrastructure. CFN was originally only offered in JSON, but we were finally treated to a heaping helping of tabs vs spaces actually mattering with <a href="https://www.trek10.com/blog/cloudformation-yaml-and-why-its-awesome">native CFN YAML support in 2016</a>.</p>



<p>CloudFormation is one of the safest ways to build, manage, change, and destroy resources in your infrastructure. It offers robust resource state management, and these days it can tell you what is going to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html">happen before you run your deployment</a>.</p>



<p>A lot of great features have worked to make CloudFormation more enjoyable or productive to work with over the years.</p>



<h3><strong>CloudFormation Macros &amp; Transforms</strong></h3>



<p>One of the more powerful concepts, bringing whole new capabilities to essentially add your own opinionated capabilities to CloudFormation. For example, Trek10 provides a macro that lets you <a href="https://github.com/trek10inc/sfn-yaml-macro">write Step Function Amazon States Language (ASL) with pure yaml</a> and smartly resolves CFN intrinsic functions.</p>



<p>You could imagine being able to provide opinionated IAM policy generators or S3 bucket resource macros. Whatever you want to do, macros can likely get you there. Take note, while powerful, you are treading dangerous territory as it becomes easy to effectively build your own Domain Specific Language. Instead of CloudFormation managing your resources, you are using CloudFormation as a bad Domain-Specific Language compiler that you have to babysit.</p>



<h3><strong>Resource Providers</strong></h3>



<p>For a while, we only had <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html">Custom Resources</a> to provision and manage resources that CloudFormation didn’t natively support. This is now largely superseded by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html">Resource Providers</a> which allow you to create private or published providers to bring the management of third party and unsupported resources into your stacks. For example, <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-as-code-with-datadog-and-cloudformation/">Datadog</a>, a popular monitoring tool can be used in your stack to provision and manage your monitoring without needing some out-of-band process.</p>



<div><p><em>In most of my recent work with CFN, I’ve defaulted to using the AWS Serverless Application Model, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">SAM</a>. SAM is a superset of CFN, with some handy transformations that let you do a bit less typing and wiring up of various resources and permissions. Think of it like a well thought out and “managed” macro. 

If you are doing anything with AWS Lambda or event-driven computing and looking to level up your YAML wrangling, start with SAM.</em></p></div>



<h2>AWS Cloud Development Kit</h2>



<p>AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is the new kid on the block, released in 2019. Using familiar programming languages and provided libraries in TypeScript, Python, Java and .NET developers can write with the same code as the rest of their stack to manage their infrastructure.</p>



<p>CDK, however, is not devoid of CloudFormation. In fact, CDK synthesizes to CloudFormation. You still leverage all the state management and inherent benefits (and downsides) of CloudFormation by adopting CDK.</p>



<p><em>A quick aside: I do want to highlight that some folks view CFN as the “assembly language” of AWS, largely because of how many tools “compile” down to CFN. I think this is a dangerous comparison. It can lead to the interpretation that, like any high-level language to assembly, you don’t really need to understand how the lower-level instruction set works to effectively leverage the higher-level constructs. In my experience, this is patently untrue in the case of CFN. Even a rudimentary understanding of CFN leads to better decisions in the higher level usages like CDK.</em></p>



<p>Ultimately, I would contend that <strong>CDK is the most comfortable and natural entry point for developers to start building Cloud Native applications</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Constructs</strong></h3>



<p>One of the particularly powerful features of CDK that I believe CloudFormation has struggled to natively deliver is the idea of truly shareable and reusable modules. CDK has introduced the concept of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html">constructs</a>. Constructs in practice provide everything from simple wrappings of some specific defaults you would like to re-use across your project all the way to complex multi-resource orchestration and wrapping of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-types.html">resource providers</a>. The distribution method for these constructs then relies on the native</p>



<p>The other important part of CDK Constructs is something neat called <a href="https://github.com/aws/jsii">jsii</a>. To quote the project; “jsii allows code in any language to naturally interact with JavaScript classes. It is the technology that enables the AWS Cloud Development Kit to deliver polyglot libraries from a single codebase!” If you write your constructs with TypeScript, it is fairly straight forward to distribute and utilize those constructs across the other core CDK languages – further encouraging sharing of modules.</p>



<p>One of the most elegant ways I can illustrate how nice the CDK experience can be is to put a side-by-side comparison of the usage of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html">Amazon States Language</a> (ASL). </p>



<p>First what it looks like in CloudFormation Native ASL:</p>

			<p>stumpled upon a bug in openssh … did a small config change in sshd_config, deployed it with ansible … and <strong>lost connectifity to all these boxes immediately</strong> … and of course, i did a config check before reloading the sshd daemon, and the config check was fine.</p>
<p>i can’t belife that nobody else found this before, as it’s really simple to reproduce. and it’s working with openbsd, debian, centos and mostly on all system which have opensshd implemented (and that’s a lot of …)</p>
<h2 id="reproduce-the-bug">reproduce the bug</h2>
<p>just add the following line to your sshd_config, do a config check and restart sshd. and you will not be able to login aging through ssh!</p>
<p><strong>DON’T TEST THIS ON YOUR PRODUCTION SYSTEMS!</strong></p>
<p>you need a console and root login/password (or do some recovery procedures in single user mode) to fix this !</p>
<pre><code>root@debian:~# echo "Match Address 2001:db8::/16"  &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config

<p>the problem is that you configured a host address instead of network address. this is not recognized by the config checker but by the sshd daemon itself.</p>
<p><strong>so, a simple Typo can bring your ssh daemon down! Reboot safe :)</strong></p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

        <p><em>The integral of the secant is well known to any beginners calculus student. Yet this integral was once a major outstanding maths problem. It was first introduced by Geradus Mercator, who needed it to make his famous map, in 1569. He couldn’t find it, and used an approximation instead. The exact solution was found accidently 86 years later without calculus in 1645. It then took another two decades until a formal proof was given in 1668, 99 years after Mercator first proposed the problem.</em></p>

<p>As this <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/how-math-works">comic</a> by SMBC rightly teases, the history of mathematics is often not so straightforward. 
Theorems, formulas and notation that are routinely discussed in class, were once insights or accidents themselves.
This is the story of one such formula, the integral of the secant. 
I first read about it almost a decade ago<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, when I got interested in cartography: the science and art of mapmaking. 
This integral is of vital importance to the Mercator map, and therefore many online maps that use it, like <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/">Apple Maps</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a>.</p>

<p>This story has been told several times before: see <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3603395">1</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0025570X.1980.11976846">2</a> or <a href="https://scholarworks.umt.edu/tme/vol7/iss2/12/">3</a>.
But these are all journal articles, consigned mostly to academics.
I want to present it here in a less formal and more colourful setting, to make it more accessible.</p>

<p>This is an article about mathematics, so familiarity with the following is helpful: algebra, trigonometry, radians and basic calculus. 
These are usually covered in advanced high school maths classes or first year maths courses.</p>

<h2 id="first-year-maths">First year maths</h2>

<p>In first year maths at university, after a month of differentiation, we were starting the inverse problem: integration. 
Differentiation  is the mathematics of finding gradient functions for curves.
Integration is the mathematics of inverting this - given a gradient function, what is the curve? 
My lecturer was introducing the integration of trigonometric functions.
He started off with:</p><p>

\[\int sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + c \:\text{  and } \int cos(x) dx = sin(x) + c\]

</p><p>This relationship made sense, because sine and cosine derivatives were opposites. Just had to be careful of minus signs. Next he derived the integral for the tangent:</p><p>

\[\int tan(x) dx = \int \frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}dx = -ln|cos(x)| + c\]

</p><p>Ok, that was tricky. It was not immediately obvious that the inverse of the chain rule could be used here, because the function $cos(x)$ was present with its derivative $sin(x)$.
But given enough thought, it made sense. Then he said, this is the integral of the secant, and learn it off by heart:</p><p>

\[\int sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + c\]

</p><p>OK, where did that come from? My lecturer offered no explanation. It was easy to verify that it worked by finding the derivative. 
(Paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0025570X.1980.11976846">2</a> has a more complex proof using only integration.)
But how had he come up with that?</p>

<p>I think, at this point, most first year calculus students like me have the following fleeting thoughts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Integration is much harder than differentiation.</li>
  <li>Some mathematician must have stumbled on this through differentiation first.</li>
  <li>It doesn’t matter anyway because where will I ever use this?</li>
</ol>

<p>Actually, number 1 is true, as many a student can testify after writing a test. 
Number 2 is false - in fact it was found by a teacher while looking at raw numbers. 
Such a method for finding an integral is so unusual, that one might conjecture it is the <em>only</em> integral that has been found like this.
Surely in calculus class, where raw numbers are so rare, you would be laughed at if you attempted to solve an integral like that.
Lastly, number 3 remains true for me. But this doesn’t mean this integral isn’t useful - it is used to construct the Mercator map. 
That is why a teacher was crunching numbers when he serendipitously realised what the formula was.</p>

</figure>

<p>The secant is a standard trigonometric function. It is defined as the ratio of the hypotenuse $c$ to the adjacent side $a$ for an angle $\varphi$ in a right angled triangle.
In mathematical notation, the definition is:</p><p>

\[sec(\varphi) = \frac{c}{a}\]

</p><p>It is the reciprocal of the more widely used cosine function:</p><p>

\[sec(\varphi) = \frac{1}{cos(\varphi)}\]

</p><p>Here are the graphs of the secant and cosine for the angles from $-2\pi$ (-360°) to $2\pi$ (360°):</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/secant_graph.png" alt="Definition of the secant">
</figure>

<p>The integral of the secant can be interpreted as the area under the graph<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This is illustrated by the shaded region.</p>

<h2 id="an-introduction-to-cartography">An introduction to cartography</h2>

<p>The earth, which is a sphere<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, cannot be projected onto a flat map without distortion. 
Over the years, cartographers have devised many different map projections which try to balance minimising distortion with other properties. 
They come in all shapes and sizes.
Lists of these projections can be found <a href="https://map-projections.net/singleview.php">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections">here</a>.
I will explain two of the simplest here, which will help with understanding the Mercator map in the next section.</p>

<p>All map projections can be represented as equations that transform spherical co-ordinates to flat map co-ordinates.
The co-ordinates on the sphere are the angles $\varphi$ and $\lambda$. These correspond to lines of latitude (parallels) and longitude (meridans) respectively. 
The co-ordinates on the flat map are $x$ and $y$. A map projection is therefore a transformation from $\varphi$ and $\lambda$ to $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>One of the simplest and oldest known projections is the equirectangular projection:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/equirectangular.png" alt="Equirectangular map">
	<figcaption>Equirectangular map. From <a href="https://map-projections.net/single-view/rectang-0">map-projections.net/singleviewp/rectang-0</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is made by mapping meridians and parallels to vertical and horizontal straight lines of constant spacing.
This has the affect of stretching out objects along the parallels.
The equations for this projection are:</p><p>

\[\begin{align} y &amp;= R\varphi\\ x &amp;= R\lambda \end{align}\]

</p><p>While the equations are simple, the construction process can be hard to visualise. Here is my attempt:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/equirectangular_construction.png" alt="Equirectangular map construction">
	<figcaption>A segment of the sphere is peeled off and flattened.
The right most image shows a top view of the flattening. The arcs are pulled flat in the longitudial direction, so that they become straight lines.
They do not change length in this process, but that requires stretching out the sides along the $x$-axis. 
Thus a single point where all the arcs meet, is stretched into a line.   </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The equirectangular map has a total area of $(2\pi R)(\pi R)=2\pi^2 R^2$ while the surface area of the sphere is $4\pi R^2$. 
Therefore this projection distorts the area by a factor of $\frac{\pi}{2}\approx1.57$.</p>

<p>A different kind of projection can be obtained by projecting lines from the sphere onto the mapping plane. 
An example is the Lambert cylindrical projection. 
It is made by wrapping a cylinder around the sphere and projecting points onto it via lines parallel to the $x$-axis. 
Here is a visualisation of this construction:</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cilinderprojectie-constructie.jpg">Wikipedia</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And here is a cross section of the sphere along side the final map:</p>

<p>The equations are:</p><p>

\[\begin{align} y &amp;= Rsin(\varphi)\\ x &amp;= R\lambda \end{align}\]

</p><p>For objects near the equator, this results in very little distortion, such as for Africa. But objects near the poles are compressed because of the sphere’s curvature. 
This can be seen clearly with Greenland.</p>

<p>This map has the useful property that its area is equal to the surface area of the sphere. Thus, while objects are distorted, their areas are still correct.
The relative scale of Greenland to Africa is therefore accurately represented in this map.</p>

<h2 id="the-mercator-map">The Mercator map</h2>

<p>In 1569, Gerardus Mercator wanted to make a global world map that would be useful for navigation. 
He lived in a time when sailing across vast ocean distances was the norm. (In 1492, Christopher Columbus had discovered America by sailing all the way from Spain.)
The maps shown above are fine for artistic impressions and applications, but not for navigation.
The distortions prevent doing any accurate distance and bearing measurements on the map. 
At a local level, lines (eg. roads) which in reality intersect perpendicularly to each other, would be appear to be slanted with respect to each other.</p>

<p>In particular, Mercator wanted to make a map where rhumb lines would be straight. Rhumb lines are curves of constant bearing relative to meridians. 
To follow a rhumb line, a navigator only needs to maintain the same bearing on their compass for the whole journey.
For example, here is the rhumb line through modern day New York and Cape Town:</p>

<figure>

	<figcaption>Made with software from <a href="https://imaginary.org/program/rhumb-lines-and-spirals">imaginary.org/program/rhumb-lines-and-spirals</a> and Inkscape </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At each point along the rhumb line, the angle $\theta$ with the meridian is 48.56°, which corresponds to a bearing of 311°26’18’’ from Cape Town to New York. 
I’ve also shown the great circle, which is a circle whose centre lies on the centre of the sphere. 
Travelling along the great circle is always shorter. In this case, the distance is 12550 km instead of 12600 km along the rhumb line.
With modern technology, it is easy for ships and aeroplanes to stick to the great circles. But back in Mercator’s day, this was rather difficult. 
So sailors preferred to stick to rhumb lines. They would rather get to their destination by travelling a little longer, then get lost and travel a lot more.</p>

<p>Mercator’s idea was to stretch out a cylindrical projection map in the North-South direction to preserve shapes and angles.
Looking at the Lambert projection<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, it can be seen that a different stretch factor is required for each latitude. At the equator, no stretch is required.
At the 45° parallel only a small amount of upward stretching is required. The objects close to the poles have to be stretched a lot to uncompress them.</p>

<p>This stretch factor can be calculated as follows:</p>

</figure>

<p>First Mercator divided the globe into graticules of equal spacing $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\lambda$. 
Along the meridians, the arc length of each graticule is $R\delta\varphi$.
Along the parallels, the radius of the circle is …</p></div></div></div></div>

August 28, 2020 | https://milliams.com/posts/2020/mesocomputing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://milliams.com/posts/2020/mesocomputing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I've been working as a <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0">Research Software Engineer</a> (RSE) at universities in the UK for many years now, across a variety of fields of research (particle physics, synthetic biology, cardiology, etc.) as both a user of computing services and as a provider of them.
One thing that I've seen cropping up repeatedly is a tendency to want to chase the latest fad.
Now, in academia the latest fad is often up to ten years behind the state-of-the-art so, for example, it's only in the last few years that we've seen "deep learning" cropping up in every grant application.
One of the things I do in my job is try to <a href="https://milliams.com/courses">educate researchers</a> about these technologies so that they know what they're actually asking for and to ensure that if researchers are talking about doing "big data" since they have "megabytes of data" they won't be embarased by a grant reviewer who knows their stuff.</p>
<p>The push in this direction is completely understandable. The grant application business is extremely competitive and anything you can put in your proposal to catch the eye of a reviewer is going to count in your favour.</p>
<p>This is all particularly evident when talking about data.
Research money goes to the problems which are most worthy and there's an assumption that the harder the problem, the more worthy it is.
Furthermore, there's an assumption that the more data one has, the bigger and more difficult the research problem.
This naturally pulls together into an idea that if your problem is a "big data" problem then it's more likely to get funded.
You therefore see grant applications trying to convince reviewers that they're doing "big data" when really they're dealing with linear or spatial datasets of maybe only gigabytes to a terabyte.
That's certainly <em>a lot of</em> data but it often lacks the complexity that requires what one would really consider <em>big</em> data solutions.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not trying to downplay these areas of research.
Instead I'm trying to argue that the problems being solved here are just as worthy of investigation, even without couching it in terms of "big data".
<em>Most</em> research problems I see discussed at Universites are not big data and they are all interesting problems.
I think it would be healthy to reduce the allure of big data and let people know that it's ok to not fall into that category.
Part of the problem is that there's no good name for this scale of data problem: that which is a little too big to realistically do on a single laptop or desktop but well below the size or complexity to require a big data machine or a Hadoop cluster.</p>
<p>I've toyed with many names when trying to teach how to tackle problems of this size: <em>Large Data</em>, <em>Biggish Data</em>, <em>Medium Data</em>.
Until now, none have ever grabbed me so I've decided to coin a new term, <strong>meso-data</strong>.
<em>Meso</em> here means "middle" or "intermediate" cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia#Etymology">Mesopotamia</a> ("between rivers").</p>
<div id="meso-computing">
<h2>Meso-computing</h2>
<p>Along with the problem in the data domain (mostly coming from buzzword-chasing), there's a similar issue in the computing-power domain.
Most research follows a common path of starting with a small investigation on a researcher's laptop until they have too many simulations to run or they are taking longer than the working day and so can't be finished in time.
At this point most research institutes will encourage the use of whatever central computing resources they have, usually a single large HPC cluster.</p>
<p>Research institutes such as Universities face a pressure of trying to justify their expenditure on computing resources by extolling all the big problems they're solving: how many nano-seconds of molecular dynamics they're pushing thorugh or how fine-grained the meteorological grid they can simulate.
This encourages the creation of systems which cater towards those few groups in the university who are able to make really good use of a supercomputer — those who can run large multi-node MPI jobs with optimised code for the specific hardware and who have experts in their team who understand high-performance computing.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it further increases the divide in power and complexity between running on one's laptop and using a central facility.
Similar to with meso-data, there's a large number of researchers — I would argue <em>most</em> researchers — whose needs sit right in the middle.
They're not doing <em>super</em>computing, they're doing <em>meso</em>-computing.</p>
<p>These researchers are best supported with small domain-specific batch clusters, with cloud computing (perhaps using <a href="https://cluster-in-the-cloud.readthedocs.io/">Cluster in the Cloud</a>), with software-as-a-service or with just some hands-on help from an RSE to get their code running more efficiently on their laptop.</p>
<p>Maybe Pandas is sufficient or perhaps they need to use Dask.
Maybe <a href="https://milliams.com/courses/parallel_python">a course</a> on <tt>concurrent.futures</tt> to magically make their code finish in a quarter of the time is the right solution.
Regardless, the solution is probably not to rewrite it in Fortran, using MPI to scale across 64 nodes or to rent a Hadoop cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-middle">
<h2>The middle</h2>
<p>There will be those reading this who think I'm stating the obvious, who think "I've been working in this area for years, what's new?".
That's kind of the point, a lot of researchers sit here but the fact is that they are under-served.
Most aren't computer experts and will use whichever tools are available, advertised to them and are easy to use.
This inevitably means that they email to one another Excel spreadsheets with maybe some R or Python scripts with hard-coded paths.
These researchers are getting stuck as "<a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">Expert Beginners</a>".
People who know their entry-level tools so well the short-term barrier to learning how to use them properly or using a better tool for the job is higher than seems worthwhile.</p>
<p>They want to scale their research but when they look around themselves to see what the University can provide, they're told about getting access to the supercomputer or how if they put their data into an Elasticsearch database things would be better.
That jump is far too big and we need to solve the social problem of allowing them to take only as many steps across the meso-data divide as they need to.
We need well-explained and easy-to-use tools at every stage of the scaling process, not just at the top end.</p>
<p>These terms, <em>meso-computing</em> and <em>meso-data</em>, are deliberately humble.
They are explicitly not about trying to be the biggest but rather about thoughtfully considering the problem at hand and choosing the right hammer.
Unlike with big data, people shouldn't have to ask the question "is this a meso-data problem" because if they're asking the question, the answer is "yes".
I want people to be comfortable saying in grant applications "since this is a meso-data challenge, we request funding for the skills and resources needed to tackle it" and ask for a full-time RSE without having to pretend that they're doing big data or need a dedicated supercomputer.
Labels are helpful and I think that these labels apply well to a good chunk of the research community.</p>
<p>Meso-data comes with its own set of tools and solutions which are partially distinct to big data's.
I haven't invented a whole new area of endeavour, many people have been working on solutions here for decades, but it's certainly not an area that attracts excitement or research money as it should.</p>
<p>These are still hard problems, and in my experience they are solving real-world challenges or furthering our understanding of the universe.
Meso-computing and meso-data projects still need expertise from RSEs or data scientists to make sure that the research is still reliable, reproducible, tested and understandable.</p>

I started preparing for the Developer Associate exam at the end of June and cleared by July end.</p>
<p>Here is my badage: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/2f8b7d13-cea5-421c-99eb-53c157c75558">AWS Badge</a></p>
<p>Developer associate is Developer focused and its bit different than the solution architect exam. I found Developer associate exam harder than the Solution Architect, but YMMV.</p>
<p>So here are my tips and preparation topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You success in exam depends upon recognizing keywords in the questions.  All answers may look similar but keywords will lead to right answer. Pay attention to words. For example: 'low cost', 'encryption at rest vs encryption in transit'.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know how to do Read Capacity Units (RCU) and Write Capacity Units (WCU) calculations. You might get one or two questions on determining RCU/WCU. Don't forget to pay attention to strongly consistent/ Eventual consistent keyword in question.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sometimes you may find answer to questions in other questions. While reviewing see if any other question has answer to it. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Use all the time available for the exam. If finished early, spend time in reviewing all questions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attempt as many mock exams you can. This will prepare you on time management and questions patterns. Questions will be verbose in real exam.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There could be command level questions like what this command do, when to use etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You need to understand the concepts very well and should have some hands on. It is easy to eliminate two answers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know CI/CD services like CodeDeploy, CodeBuild, CodeCommit. Understand BuildSpec and AppSpec difference. Code Deploy lifecycle hooks. CodeDeploy Deployment Types for Lambda, ECS and EC2.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cloudformation, KMS, SQS, SNS, ECS, API gateway, IAM (Inline policies/ Managed Policies) and Lambda (Concurrent execution Limit, </p>
</li>
<li><p>DynamoDB. Local Secondary Index vs Global. DynamoDB Accelerator. DynamoDB Streams. SCAN vs Query. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Amazon S3, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk and its deployment types. Knows CORS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>CloudWatch, CloudTrail, App X-Ray</p>
</li>
<li><p>You might also get architecture level questions but not much.</p>

<p>DebConf20 was due to take place in Haifa, Israel this year (<a href="https://debian.community/debconf20-palestine-messages-censored-debian-project/">a separate controversy about Debian censoring Palestine</a>) but it was moved online due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Therefore, what happens to all the sponsorship money collected in 2020?  Let's look at how Debian parks money in Switzerland.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, Debian paid somebody to work on DebConf fundraising <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/alums/">as an Outreachy</a>, generating a lot of gossip that is unfair to the woman concerned.  Naturally, as in any business, fundraising salaries and other costs of acquiring sponsors are the first things that will be deducted from the budget.  We share the view of those who feel she was underpaid: the woman is a highly experienced event organizer.  Debian paid a total of $6,000 for her services, $2,000 per month.  $500 was deducted by Outreachy administrator, Sage Sharp.  This is also controversial, as Sage Sharp does the same work that Debian's GSoC Administrators do, Sage Sharp receives a cut of the money but the Debian GSoC Administrators don't receive anything.  If the woman was employed at an event management company in Israel, she would have received more than $6,000 <em>every</em> month, overtime pay, illness and accident insurance, pension, maternity rights and a performance bonus.  Many non-profit organizations give their fundraising staff at least 10% of all revenues as salary and bonus.  With her experience, the woman in question would easily get that salary package in any other industry.</p>

<p>After deducting the $5,500 Outreachy salary and $500 Sage Sharp fees, what does Debian do with the rest of the money <a href="https://debconf20.debconf.org/sponsors/">from these sponsors</a>?  As we are online in 2020, there are no venue expenses, no travel and accommodation expenses.  We estimate that DebConf has received over $100,000 from these companies and nobody knows where it will go.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Item</th><th>Increase</th><th>Decrease</th></tr>
<tr><td>Sponsor donations</td><td>$100,000</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Fundraising cost (Outreachy employee)</td><td></td><td>$6,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>DebConf20 online surplus</td><td>$94,000</td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<em>(Not actual figures, estimated from previous DebConfs)</em>

<p>Will this money be used to pay all the volunteers for the next DebConfs?  Or will it be used for other Debian purposes?</p>

<p>Let's have a look at DebConf13 to find the answer.</p>

<img width="40%" alt="Debian hiding money Switzerland" src="https://debian.community/assets/debconf13-logo.png">
<p>DebConf13 organizers had organized the venue and catering contracts separately.  Neither the venue hire or catering contract included provision for washing the dishes.  At the last minute, DebConf organizers had to reach out to local labor-hire companies to find temporary workers and <a href="https://debian.community/assets/2013-07-08-urgent-dishwashing-proposal.pdf">they received a proposal for the work</a>.  Nonetheless, they didn't want to pay people.  As usual, various people suggested they should try to conscript volunteers to do this tedious work:</p>

<blockquote><em>

I'd join a team to coordinate volunteers on this.</p></em></blockquote>

<p>Volunteers don't come to DebConf to wash dishes, they want to relax after dinner, meet people, attend any evening seminars and learn new things.</p>

<img width="30%" alt="debian women, diversity, washing dishes, debconf, outreachy, intern, woman" src="https://debian.community/assets/debconf13-women-washing-dishes.jpg">
<p>Nonetheless, organizers proceeded to seek volunteers for this task.  We notice that female participation in dishwashing was close to thirty percent, much higher than the <a href="https://debian.community/laura-arjona-reina-carnival-mafia-murders/">two percent rate of female participation in development</a>.  Is that a win for diversity?</p>

<p>While discussion about expenditures and volunteers took place on the public <em>debconf-team</em> list, discussions about profit from fundraising were kept on <em>debian-private</em> (<a href="https://debian.community/debian-private-leaked/">leaked elsewhere</a>).  Local volunteers, who do most of the work in each DebConf destination, were subscribed to <em>debconf-team</em> but they never have access to <em>debian-private</em> so they didn't see the following email:</p>

<blockquote><em>Subject: Call for ideas -- useful ways of spending Debian money<br>
Date: Tue, 1 Oct 2013 21:46:17 +0200<br>
From: Lucas Nussbaum &lt;leader@debian.org&gt;<br>
To: debian-private@lists.debian.org<br>
CC: auditor@debian.org, philipp@hug.cx<p>

[ TL;DR: <b>ETOO_MUCH_MONEY</b> -- need ideas to flush queue ]</p><p>

Hi,</p><p>

Thanks to the fantastic work of the DebConf13 sponsorship (fundraising)<br>
team, DebConf13 generated a surplus. The current estimate of it is <b>CHF 38k</b> (that's <b>USD 42k</b>, or <b>EUR 31k</b>). That's excellent news.</p><p>

The not-so-excellent news is that it means that the debconf13<br>
association will have to pay income taxes for it. (no estimate yet;<br>
Philipp Hug (DC13 and debian.ch treasurer) will get in touch with a tax<br>
expert).</p><p>

Even if Switzerland has been very welcoming towards Debian, it would not<br>
be a bad idea to try to avoid paying too much taxes. A good way to do<br>
that is to spend some of the surplus (in ways useful to Debian, of<br>
course).</p><p>

Could you start thinking of useful ways to spend some money? servers?<br>
porter boxes? buildds? sprints? Of course, it would need to be spent before<br>
the end of 2013. There are no known restrictions on what we can buy or<br>
where we can ship. What we end up buying will of course be made public<br>
as usual. To move forward, please reply to this mail, providing an<br>
estimate and a justification. Or mail leader@ + auditor@ if you prefer.</p><p>


Somehow related: we are participating in GNOME's Outreach Program for<br>
Women, winter edition[1].</p><p>

As already stated in April[2], I wouldn't favor a situation where Debian<br>
funds are used to pay OPW participation on a regular basis. However, as<br>
an experiment, it makes sense to help that happen for the first time (it<br>
didn't happen in the summer edition).</p><p>

So, if the fundraising effort currently being set up fails to raise<br>
enough money for one stipend, but still raises a significant amount of<br>
money, I will authorize the use of Debian money for the difference<br>
(likely for at most $2900 -- that's half the stipend, so the other half<br>
needs to come from fundraising).</p><p>

[2] https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/04/msg00108.html</p><p>


Q: Why is this on -private@?<br>
A: Because I'm not sure yet how cautious we need to be about the DC13<br>
   surplus situation. Better safe than sorry. We can restart the<br>
   discussion on a public list when/if things are cleared.<br>
 Thanks,</p><p>

Lucas</p></em></blockquote>

<p>Let us amend that final answer:</p>

<blockquote><em>Q: Why is this on -private@?<br>

<p>Despite Nussbaum's intention to spend the money, it remains in a Swiss bank account with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostFinance">PostFinance</a>.</p>

<p>Where does all the money go?  Well, we know that some of it goes to lawyers.  After a volunteer's father died, Debian was the only organization to send him insults through a lawyer.  We've been told Miriam Ballhausen at Bird &amp; Bird charges EUR 300 per hour for her services, which now includes writing emails and letters on behalf of the Debian project.  The Debian Project doesn't exist as a legal entity, Ballhausen has so far refused to reveal who is actually instructing her.</p>

<p>If that rate is correct, the EUR 31,000 profit from DebConf13 would pay for 100 hours or two weeks of full-time lawyer work.  We doubt that we will see Frau Ballhausen assisting with the dishes.</p>

<p>We would have thought that the legal profession may have some minimum standards, expecting lawyers to respect volunteers at a time of grief and expecting them to be able to identify who they work for.  Not in Germany.  Ballhausen's antics with Debian have seen her <a href="https://awards.womeninbusinesslaw.com/Europe-shortlist?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wibl-eu&amp;utm_content=twittershare#Rising-stars">nominated for the Women in Business Law Awards 2020</a>.</p>

<p>The next DebConf for 2021 was supposed to go to Prishtina, Kosovo.  It has been suggested it will be pushed back one year to 2022 but given the pandemic situation, that is not a definite decision.  There are currently no Debian Developers in Kosovo who have access to the financial information in <em>debian-private</em>, we hope that Debian will be as generous in paying the Kosovo local team as they have been with lawyers but we are doubtful.</p>

<p>I’ve heard ham radio is dying since as far back as I can remember. It’s one of those common sayings you always hear. Like, “get off my lawn,” and “kids these days.” But is it true? Is there any evidence to support this? Let’s take a closer look.</p>



<h2>Ham radio licensees are increasing</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png" alt="" width="733" height="447" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png 900w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-300x183.png 300w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-768x469.png 768w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-850x519.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px"></figure>



<p>Data from the ARRL shows that ham radio licensees are increasing. When you look at the chart above, you see two significant markers that are likely driving this growth. </p>



<ul><li>The removal of the code requirement by the FCC.</li><li>The economic collapse of 2008.</li></ul>



<p>The Morse code requirement was always an intimidating part of obtaining your General FCC license. Learning Morse code is like learning a second language. It takes time and effort to learn, and that’s not a bad thing. However, it doesn’t change that it scared many people away from the hobby. When the FCC removed this requirement in 2007, I believe it opened the door for many who spent years on the fence. Then you have the economic downturn of 2008. What does that have to do with ham radio? A lot.</p>



<p>After the economic downturn, the United States watched as survivalism, now commonly calling “prepping,” entered mainstream culture. People were worried as the country was involved in multiple wars and our economy was on the brink of collapse. Citizens stocked up on food storage, water, firearms, and…<em>communications equipment</em>. As our country spiraled into more turmoil ham radio licenses steadily increased to more than 750,000 by the end of 2019. </p>



<h2>Is ham radio a hobby or a public service?</h2>



<p><strong>The debate between ham radio being a public service or just a hobby is a common argument</strong>. The reason we exist is to ultimately have a trained citizenry that can response to natural disasters. This will always be a thread in our hobby, but this thread is merging more and more with digital functions, including the Internet. That’s where some people get grumpy.</p>



<h3>FT8/JS8Call</h3>



<p><a href="https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FT8/JS8Call</a> has drew the ire from older operators who don’t see it as “real ham radio.” Though the technology could have huge implications for passing traffic when conditions are rough in remote parts of the world.</p>



<h3>Digital Mobile Radio (DMR)</h3>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Mobile Radio</a> has exploded in growth in the past decade. Many amateur radio operators use <a href="http://k0lwc.com/what-is-the-range-of-a-dmr-hotspot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet-connected hotspots</a> to operate from their shack without tying up local repeaters. These Internet-connected repeaters hold value, the biggest is the ability to have two different time slots carrying voice traffic simultaneously on one repeater, whether they have an Internet connection or not. DMR doesn’t need to have an Internet backbone to be a game-changer for emergency communications.</p>



<p>Ham radio will always be a hobby where those engaged are practicing to help if the need ever arises, whether they participate in public service events with local clubs or not. And younger operators are redefining how it’s done with new digital technologies — and that’s a great thing!</p>



<h2>Millennials are not killing ham radio… they’re the future</h2>



<p>Some ham radio operators believe younger hams are “killing” the hobby. These often dismissive and vile opinions are not great for the future of amateur radio. Integrating new technology like VOIP and microcomputers into amateur radio is what it’s all about—using the resources available to communicate and exchange information with others around the world. Who cares how we get it done?</p>



<h3>Getting young kids involved in ham radio</h3>



<p>We must get children interested in the hobby. Today, kids aren’t impressed with the ability to talk around with the world on 100 watts and a wire. They’re just not. How do we get young people interested in the digital age where they can communicate anywhere in the world with a tap of a button? The ARRL hasn’t done a great job in attracting young people — but there are things we can do!</p>



<h3>Capitalize on the next generation of space exploration</h3>



<p>The United States is embarking on the next generation of space exploration. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are making space and engineering cool again, and ham radio could easily ride that wave. Focus on targeting kids interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and educate them on AMSAT and the potential to communicate with the International Space Station (ISS). Using space exploration as a drive for getting a ham license would be a fantastic entry point for space geeks everywhere.</p>



<h3>Use remote HF and SWL stations to spark interest</h3>



<p>For young ham radio operators who already have their license, look no further than <a href="https://www.remotehamradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remote Ham Radio</a> as a shining example of how to get kids interested in upgrading their license. <a href="https://www.remotehamradio.com/youth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They offer a program where kids can win free time</a> using world-class remote DX contest stations. The young hams have to meet the following criteria:</p>



<ul><li>Be 25 years old or younger</li><li>Hold a General class or higher license</li><li>Be a member of the ARRL</li><li>Have an interest or experience in DXing/Contesting</li><li>Tell us why RHR would be a good fit for you</li></ul>



<p>Kudos to Remote Ham Radio for offering this program to young hams!</p>



<h3>POTA/SOTA combines ham radio and outdoor adventure</h3>



<p>Living in Colorado, I grew fond of Summits On The Air (SOTA) rather quickly. I mean, it’s cool. You can exercise while playing ham radio all at the same time. We should be focusing on how we can use these outdoor portable operations to attract young hams who love the outdoors. For the extreme outdoor enthusiasts, it would be wise to focus on the usefulness of being able to communicate from the wilderness where cell phone signals are non-existent.</p>



<p><strong>Ham radio has evolved</strong>, albeit slowly compared to other technology sectors. That evolution is inevitable. We can’t fight it. We shouldn’t fight it. We need to find ways to encourage new exploration of communication methodology. That all starts with younger ham radio operators bringing new ideas and skills to our hobby.</p>



<p>Let’s not fight it. Let’s embrace it.</p>

<p>Two months ago, I self-published a book called <a href="https://zerotosoldbook.com/">Zero to Sold: How to Start, Run, and Sell a Bootstrapped Business</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1277573850297966592">released it on Twitter</a>. Within twenty-four hours, I sold 350 copies. Within another twenty-four hours, the book was #1 on Product Hunt and already a category bestseller on Amazon. After a week, 1000 copies had been sold, with sales still going strong and the book ranking as #1 New Release in the “Startups” and “Small Business” Amazon categories. How did this happen?</p>

<h2>The Void</h2>



<p>It started with a blog post that I never published. In 2018, I was so fully immersed in working on <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/from-founding-to-exit-in-two-years-the-feedbackpanda-story/">FeedbackPanda, a teacher productivity SaaS</a> that I co-founded with my partner <a href="https://twitter.com/SimpsonDaniK">Danielle</a>, that I didn’t have much time or energy to write. Every day was filled with customer conversations and product work, with barely any space to reflect on what we had learned. I used the few moments of clarity to jot down notes in a text document, hoping that I’d find some time to polish them into an article. But it never got anywhere near being ready to be published.</p>



<p>And then, we <a href="https://www.sureswiftcapital.com/blog/bootstrapped-saas-founders-sell-business/">chose to sell the business</a>. After a few months of due diligence and transitioning the business over to the new owners, I finally had all the time I ever wanted. My life turned from running a business at full speed into idling my thumbs. When you build an exceptionally sellable company, you focus on making yourself replaceable. Little did I know that once I was replaced, I didn’t have a purpose anymore. So I threw myself right into my next project: documenting what we did and sharing what we had learned. Leading up to building FeedbackPanda, I had consumed a lot of content that successful founders had shared with the community. I wanted to do the exact same thing now: give back to other bootstrapped founders and indie hackers.</p>



<p>Since I hadn’t yet decided on a medium through which I would share my insights, I started collecting content ideas by taking notes whenever I thought of a particular theme. I knew that I would want to release articles on many subjects on a platform, so I planned them out as blog posts from the start. I started working on this list in August of 2019.</p>



<p>Initially, all those ideas revolved around coping with stress and anxiety on some level. That had been the emotional state in which I had found myself in towards the end of running FeedbackPanda. The first series of blog posts I wanted to write was called <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/emotional-journey/">The Emotional Journey of a Bootstrapped Founder</a>.</p>



<p>In a Notion document, I created a table of all my blog post title ideas. Quickly, after I had exhausted all my anxiety-related topics, I pivoted into other areas of running a SaaS business as well. Within a couple days, I had aggregated somewhere between forty and fifty blog post ideas. At that point, I understood for the first time that this might be my next big project.</p>

<p>Whenever I felt like it, I would click on each blog post title idea and jot down a few thoughts on what I’d write about in the article. I would add links to interesting essays, research papers, even photos of little sketches I made on paper.</p>

<p>Several blog posts took shape over the weeks, and I decided to turn this project into reality. I polished those articles following <a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro">Julian Shapiro’s recommendations</a>. I ended up with ten or so pieces to start the blog with.</p>



<h2>The Blog</h2>



<p>Here’s an open secret about me: I’m incredibly lazy. If I can avoid tedious work, I’ll spend a lot of time to make sure I never have to do it again. While this really helped us build a well-documented and highly automated business, it is a drawback for a content creator. Writing well and regularly takes a lot of discipline. I knew that I needed some structure in place to hold myself accountable beyond the articles I had already written.</p>



<p>To make sure that this project wouldn’t just evaporate, I decided to commit to building a blog by publishing one article every week, for at least two years. But how could I force myself to write every week? Looking at the content that I regularly consume, I figured that releasing a newsletter every week would keep me accountable for writing something meaningful regularly.</p>



<p>When I built The Bootstrapped Founder blog, I immediately set it up to host the Bootstrapped Founder Newsletter. I released the first episode of that within days of making the blog public. <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1194647611988480000">I announced the launch on Twitter</a>, and got just a few likes. Not surprising.  I had a fledgling audience of maybe 500 followers on Twitter, and I made sure to share my content as much as I could within those first few weeks, including <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/the-bootstrapped-founder/launched-the-bootstrapped-founder-blog--LtZG5nAqrB8ucRj5F-v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the IndieHackers product page</a> I had created for the blog.</p>

<p>My Twitter strategy was simple: just be myself. I love reading the stories of other founders, no matter if they are succeeding or struggling. Amplifying those voices, retweeting their milestones, and commenting when they asked for help was something I consciously did every day. Within weeks, my audience grew, apparently both intrigued by my blog posts, levels of activity, and engagement with the community.</p>



<p>That gave me the fuel to write more and more. There were weeks where I’d work on three to five blog posts at the same time, driven by the discussions I had on Twitter. More and more topics and themes emerged through this work. The list of forty blog post title ideas turned into a list of hundreds of topics, all in different stages of being worked on.</p>



<p>Throughout all of this, people started asking to consume my content on another medium: they wondered if I would ever start a podcast. As a German who learned speaking English mostly from watching Al Bundy on Married with Children and raid-leading large groups of gamers in World of Warcraft back in 2008, I hesitated to put myself out there in an audio-only format. But I quickly understood that this would result in many exciting opportunities: I could diversify my userbase to include those who had no time to read, those who didn’t like reading, it would be another channel to market whatever I would end up selling in the future, and it would allow my readers to put a voice to the thoughts. I would just read the article aloud as the first half of each show. Then, I could add some unscripted content to each episode to make it attractive for those who already read what I had written. Since I wanted the material between the podcast and the blog to be synchronized, I spent a few weeks recording a show or two every day to catch up.</p>



<h2>The Guide</h2>



<p>While I was on this journey through my back catalog, I noticed a fascinating thing. All those blog posts titles I had written when random thoughts had occurred to me seemed to fit into a structure. A larger entity started to take shape. After a few hours of shuffling titles around in a Notion document, I had found that I was well on my way to write a fully-fledged guide on bootstrapping. Without knowing or intending for it to happen, here it was, everything I knew about the journey from idea to acquisition.</p>



<p>I had written maybe 30% of the actual articles I wanted to have in that guide. I decided to go at it for the rest of them the only way I know as a software engineer and bootstrapper: sketch out a foundation and then iterate slowly and deliberately. For the guide (that at that point was called “The Bootstrapped Founder Guide to Bootstrapping,”) that meant that it would start with a compendium. I outlined it by sorting the blog posts I had already written into a structure and putting only headlines in the gaps. Then, over a few days, I filled out those gaps with two to three paragraphs each. I condensed the most important points I would want to make in those yet-to-be-written articles into a few sentences.</p>



<p>And then, I <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1222896794893336578">immediately released the compendium</a> on the 30th of January of 2020, two months after I had started writing on the blog. A few days prior, a Twitter follower had suggested the name “From Zero to Sold,” which I really liked. I shortened it to “Zero to Sold,” and featured the compendium prominently on my website and social media profiles.</p>

<p>From there on, I continued to write an article every week, shared it with my growing newsletter audience, read it on the podcast, and integrated it into the compendium. When I had written around half of the number of articles I wanted to write, someone on Twitter asked me if they could get the compendium as a PDF. They said they’d even pay $10 for it. That really made me think. And when I think, I tweet. Lots of people replied that they’d love to see the compendium fleshed out as a full book.</p>



<p>Suppose you’ve looked into Zero to Sold or have checked out the compendium. In that case, you will know that I recommend an Audience-Problem-Solution-Product approach. Start with a group of people you want to help, find their critical problems, envision a solution that fits their workflow, and build a product in the medium they wish to use. And here was a group of founders and indie hackers (an audience I love), telling me that they need guidance on building their business (a critical problem commonly shared), asking for a full-journey guide (a clear solution to the problem), as a book (as a medium of product consumption). This could not be more validated if I wanted to.</p>



<p>So I sat down to write the rest of the book.</p>



<h2>The Manuscript</h2>



<p>Let me share a few details on how that exactly happened. The first few blog posts were written in Notion, which really didn’t lend itself to long-form writing. I quickly migrated those texts over into individual markdown files, which I …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
			<p><span>S</span>ome of the most perplexing topics in physics revolve around quantum theory. The quandary is seen most famously in the Schrödinger’s cat question and the issue of information loss in black hole evaporation. Richard Feynman&nbsp;said, “I&nbsp;think that I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.” Most physicists have just gotten used to it. There’s no doubt quantum theory is successful at the practical level. But when considering it as more than a tool for calculating probabilities for possible outcomes of experiments in the laboratory, and taking it as a fundamental description of the “world out there,” it faces serious conceptual problems.</p><p>The basic problem is that quantum theory seems to be about <i>what we measure</i> and not about <i>what is out there in the world</i>. One might think this is just fine, as the theory represents just “our information” about the world. But that would make sense only if there were something about the world that we can be informed of, which must be, in general situations, specified by the theory. Understanding how to deal with this conceptual problem requires us to look at the theory in more detail.</p><figure data-alt="Sudarsky_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17606_7b308824b9a5a738569e0908bd7c9656.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BLACK HOLE PARADOX:</strong> If a black hole evaporates completely, leaving only the thermal radiation, there seems to be no way in which it might encode all the information needed to recreate the exact quantum state of the matter that gave rise to the black hole in the first place.</span><span>NASA</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to quantum theory, a generic state of a system (a particle’s position or velocity) does not have well-defined values. That indefiniteness is known as “quantum uncertainty,” and, unfortunately also as “quantum fluctuation.” The quantum theory presented in standard textbooks involves two distinct rules for the evolution of the state of a physical system. One, referred to by Roger Penrose, is the U-process. It’s represented by the Schrödinger equation, allowing the precise determination of the state of the system at any future time (deterministic prediction), or time in the past (complete retrodiction), given the state of the system at present. But this rule only holds as long as the system is not subjected to an “observation.”<br></p><p>The second rule, which comes into play when some attribute of the system is observed or measured, is a stochastic rule, referred to by Penrose as the R-process. According to this rule, as a result of the measurement, the state jumps into one of the states where the attribute in question has a well-defined value. This rule does not allow, in general, a precise prediction of which state that would be, nor the retrodiction of the state previous to the measurement or observation. One can use it to accurately predict probabilities, and predict the average value that would emerge from a large number of repetitions of the experiment, as well as the statistical dispersion of the results, a quantity that coincides, in numerical value, with the level of indefiniteness mentioned above.</p><blockquote><p>The nature of black hole singularity has given rise to wild speculations.</p> </blockquote><p>One of the problems is that quantum theory is obscure (to say the least) regarding what it claims about the nature of the world when no one is looking. Is the involvement of a consciousness required for the theory to make sense, and if so, does that include a mouse’s or a fly’s? In particular, the specification of what constitutes a measurement is irreparably vague. Perhaps all that’s needed is a large enough apparatus. But what’s large enough? And what happens at the boundary? These issues are referred to as the measurement problem. Such conceptual difficulties are usually ignored by practicing physicists.<br></p><p>One exception is provided by David Bohm, who rediscovered a proposal (originally considered by Louis de Broglie) giving a different characterization of the theory, with point-like particles that at all times have definite positions and velocities, while the quantum state simply guides them in their time evolution (and a cat is never simultaneously dead and alive). Another notable exception is exemplified by the proponents of modifications of the theory that would unify the U and R processes into a single law, removing the need to introduce the notion of “measurement” at the fundamental level. In that case, Schrödinger’s misfortunate pet would be either dead or alive, even if no one is looking.</p><p>This approach has formed the basis of “spontaneous collapse” theories,<sup>1</sup> which are characterized by invoking something akin to a collection of miniature versions of the R process occurring spontaneously to all particles throughout space and time; that is, without the need for a measurement to take place. Further out on the frontier is the many-worlds theory (pioneered by Hugh Everett), in which every measurement is tied to a bifurcation (or multifurcation) of reality into something like parallel coexisting worlds.</p><p>A careful analysis shows that these are essentially the three logical avenues that might be taken to deal with the issue<sup>2</sup>: Modify the theory by adding something beyond the quantum state (the hidden variable rout exemplified by the de-Brogile-Bohm approach), modify rules for evolution in the theory by having measurement-like events occur all the time (as in the spontaneous collapse theories), or remove the R process altogether (which takes us down the many-worlds path).</p><p>Many quantum physicists are convinced the issue at large, or the approach one might take in its regard, are of no relevance to the challenges in their fields. I, among a small group of colleagues, hold a dramatically different view, and maintain that spontaneous collapse is the most promising route to address some of the most serious difficulties faced by our current understanding of the laws of the universe, and in particular those situations where gravitation and quantum theory must be used together.&nbsp;</p><p><span>A</span> central feature of cosmology, as we commonly understand it, is an epoch known as inflation, thought to have taken place in the first fractions of a second after the Planck epoch, itself a mysterious regime. In the Planck epoch, quantum gravity should rule, and the notions of spacetime itself would probably cease to be relevant or useful. (Quantum gravity refers to a theory that would harmoniously combine the basic principles of general relativity, our best theory of gravitation, and quantum theory.) In this inflationary regime, the usual concepts of spacetime are supposed to be adequate. But in addition, gravitation is thought to be well described by general relativity, and matter explained by the same type of theories we use in ordinary particle physics situations (such as those explored empirically in places like CERN or in the studies of high energy cosmic rays).</p><p>The main difference is that the type of matter thought to be dominant in the inflationary epoch is a field known as the inflaton. This is a little bit like the electromagnetic field, but far simpler, because it lacks intrinsic directionality or spin. The main feature of that epoch is that the universe expands, as a result of the gravitational effects of the inflaton field, in an extremely fast and accelerated manner (by a total expansion factor of at least a million trillion trillion times; i.e., a factor of 10<sup>30</sup>). As a result, the spatial curvature of the universe is driven to zero, and all deviations from perfect homogeneity and isotropy are completely diluted (the remaining deviations of the order of 10<sup>-90</sup>, so small, that for simplicity, I will take it as zero).</p><p>The inflationary epoch ends when the inflaton field decays, filling the universe with all the matter we find in it today: the usual matter from which you, the chair you are sitting on, and the solar system are made of; the slightly more exotic type of matter we are able to produce for fractions of a second with powerful particle accelerators like CERN’s; and even the elusive dark matter that seems to constitute the overwhelming part of galaxies and galactic clusters. In other words, the end of the inflationary epoch is supposed to lead into the regime described by the older, traditional, and empirically successful Big Bang cosmology, describing an expanding universe filled with extremely hot plasma composed of all the variety of particles with their respective abundances basically ruled by thermodynamic considerations. A universe that cooled down as it expanded, leading to the formation of light nuclei (when the temperature dropped to about a billion degrees Kelvin), and much later, to the formation of the first atoms (at about 3,000 degrees Kelvin). This latter stage is the one in which the photons corresponding to cosmic microwave background radiation are emitted.</p><div>

The point is that the universe is not, and has not been, homogeneous and isotropic for quite some time. On the other hand, according to inflation, the universe’s violent expansion completely diluted all inhomogeneities (differences in conditions between different places) and anisotropies (differences among different directions). That situation is described in terms of a spacetime and inflaton field in states that are completely homogeneous and isotropic.</p><p>Where do the inhomogeneities that led to the formation of all cosmic structure, and whose imprint we see in the cosmic microwave background, come from?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-117003837978044104">
<p>A few days ago, in the programming subreddit, <a href="https://cuchi.me/posts/go-vs-rust">Paulo Henrique Cuchi shared his experience writing a command line tool in both Rust and Go</a>. The tool in question is a client for his side project, Hashtrack. Hashtrack exposes a GraphQL API with which the clients can track certain twitter hashtags and get a real time list of relevant tweets. Prompted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/i3529m/writing_the_same_cli_application_twice_using_go/g09rnsy/">this comment</a>, I decided to write a D port to demonstrate how D can be used to achieve a similar goal. I'll try to keep the same structure as the one he used in his blog post.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/azihassan/hashtrack-client">Source code on Github</a></p>





<p>The main reason is that the original blog post compared statically typed languages like Go and Rust, and made honorable mentions to Nim and Crystal, but didn't mention D. D falls under this category, so I think this will make for an interesting comparison</p>

<p>I also like D as a language and I have mentioned it in various other blog posts.</p>



<p><a href="https://dlang.org/download.html">The manual</a> has a lengthy page on how to download and install the reference compiler, DMD. Windows users can get the installer, while MacOS users can use homebrew. On Ubuntu, I simply add the apt repository and perform a normal apt installation. With this, you'll get DMD, but also dub, the package manager.</p>

<p>I installed Rust to have an idea on how easy it would be to get up and running. I was surprised by how easy it was. I only had to run <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">the interactive installer</a>, which took care of the rest. I did have to add ~/.cargo/bin to the path. Now that I think about it, I probably should have just restarted the console for the changes to take effect.</p>



<p>I wrote hashtrack in Vim without much difficulty, but that's probably because I have some familiarity with where everything goes in the standard library. I did have the documentation open at all times because I occasionally used a symbol I didn't import from the right package, or I called a function with the wrong arguments. Note that as far as the standard library is concerned, you can just import std; and have everything at your disposal. For third party libraries though, you're on your own.</p>

<p>I was curious about the state of tooling so I looked into plugins for my favourite IDE, Intellij IDEA. I found <a href="https://github.com/intellij-dlanguage/intellij-dlanguage">this one</a> and installed it. I also instealled DCD and DScanner by cloning their respective repos and building them, then configuring the IDEA plugin to point to the right paths. Shout out to the author of <a href="http://www.samael.me.uk/2015/12/d-plugin-for-intellij-idea.html">this blog post</a> for explaining the process.</p>

<p>I ran into a few issues at first, but they were fixed after updating both the IDE and the plugin. One of the problems I had is that it couldn't recognize my own packages and kept marking them as "possibly undefined". I later discovered that I had to put "module name_of_the_package;" on top of the file in order for it to be recognized.</p>

<p>I think it still has a bug where it doesn't recognize .length, at least on my machine. I opened an issue on Github, you can follow it <a href="https://github.com/intellij-dlanguage/intellij-dlanguage/issues/587">here</a> if you're curious.</p>

<p>If you're on Windows, I've heard good things about <a href="https://github.com/rainers/visuald">VisualD</a></p>



<p>Dub is the defacto package manager in D. It fetches and installs dependencies from https://code.dlang.org/. For this project, I needed an HTTP client because I didn't feel like using cURL. I ended up fetching two dependencies, requests and its dependency, cachetools, which has no dependency of its own. For some reason though, it fetched twelve more dependencies :</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vlxU75DJksw/Xzx2RdIs2pI/AAAAAAAAAZk/jl8OA1kUD2U6HjaFu_2jUVUi76-aVORsQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1108/Screenshot_2020-08-19%2Bazihassan%2Bhashtrack-client.png"><img data-original-height="525" data-original-width="1108" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vlxU75DJksw/Xzx2RdIs2pI/AAAAAAAAAZk/jl8OA1kUD2U6HjaFu_2jUVUi76-aVORsQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Screenshot_2020-08-19%2Bazihassan%2Bhashtrack-client.png" width="640"></a></p>&nbsp;

<p>I think dub uses them internally, but I'm not sure about that.</p>

<p>Rust downloaded a lot of crates, but that's probably because the Rust version of the code has more features than mine has. For example, it fetched <a href="https://github.com/conradkleinespel/rpassword">rpassword</a>, a tool that hides password characters as you type them into a terminal, much like Python's getpass function. <strike>That's one of the many things I don't have in my code.</strike> I added <a href="https://github.com/azihassan/hashtrack-client/pull/11">getpass support</a> for Linux thanks to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24222188">this recommendation</a>. I also added terminal text formatting thanks to the escape sequences I copied from the original Go source code.</p>



<p>Having little knowledge of graphql, I had no idea where to begin. A "graphql" search on code.dlang.org led me to a relevant library, aptly named <a href="https://github.com/burner/graphqld">"graphqld"</a>. After looking into it though, it struck me as more of a vibe.d plugin than an actual client, if there is such a thing.</p>

<p>After inspecting the network requests on Firefox, I realized that for this project, I could just mimic the graphql queries and mutations, which I would then send with an HTTP client. Responses are just JSON objects that I can parse with the tools provided by the std.json package. With this in mind, I started looking for HTTP clients and settled on <a href="https://github.com/ikod/dlang-requests/">requests</a>, a simple to use HTTP client, but more importantly, one that has reached a certain level of maturity.</p>

<p>I copied the outgoing requests from the network inspector and pasted them in separate .graphql files, which I then imported and sent with the appropriate variables. The bulk of the functionality was put in the GraphQLRequest structure because I wanted to inject different endpoints and configurations into it, a requirement of the project :</p>

<pre>struct GraphQLRequest
{
    string operationName;
    string query;
    JSONValue variables;
    Config configuration;

    JSONValue toJson()
    {
        return JSONValue([
            "operationName": JSONValue(operationName),
            "variables": variables,
            "query": JSONValue(query),
        ]);
    }

    string toString()
    {
        return toJson().toPrettyString();
    }

    Response send()
    {
        auto request = Request();
        request.addHeaders(["Authorization": configuration.get("token", "")]);
        return request.post(
            configuration.get("endpoint"),
            toString(),
            "application/json"
        );
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Here's a snippet of the session package. The following code handles authentication :</p>

<pre>struct Session
{
    Config configuration;

    void login(string username, string password)
    {
        auto request = createSession(username, password);
        auto response = request.send();
        response.throwOnFailure();
        string token = response.jsonBody
            ["data"].object
            ["createSession"].object
            ["token"].str;
        configuration.put("token", token);
    }

    GraphQLRequest createSession(string username, string password)
    {
        enum query = import("createSession.graphql").lineSplitter().join("\n");
        auto variables = SessionPayload(username, password).toJson();
        return GraphQLRequest("createSession", query, variables, configuration);
    }
}

struct SessionPayload
{
    string email;
    string password;

    //todo : make this a template mixin or something
    JSONValue toJson()
    {
        return JSONValue([
            "email": JSONValue(email),
            "password": JSONValue(password)
        ]);
    }

    string toString()
    {
        return toJson().toPrettyString();
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Spoiler alert : I never did that todo</p>

<p>It goes like this: the main() function creates a Config struct from the command line arguments and injects it into the Session struct, which implements the functionality of the login, logout and status commands. The createSession() method constructs the graphQL request by reading the actual request from the appropriate .graphql file and passing the variables along with it. I didn't want to pollute the source code with graphQL mutations and queries so I moved them to .graphql files that I then import during the compilation with the help of enum and import. The latter requires a compiler flag to point it to the stringImportPaths (which defaults to views/).</p>

<p>As to the login() method, its sole responsibility is sending the HTTP request and handling the response. In this case, it handles the potential errors, though not thoroughly. It then stores the token in a config file, which is really nothing more than a glorified JSON object.</p>

<p>The throwOnFailure method is not part of the core functionality of the requests library. It is actually a helper function that does quick and dirty error handling:</p>

<pre>void throwOnFailure(Response response)
{
    if(!response.isSuccessful || "errors" in response.jsonBody)
    {
        string[] errors = response.errors;
        throw new RequestException(errors.join("\n"));
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Since D supports <a href="https://tour.dlang.org/tour/de/gems/uniform-function-call-syntax-ufcs">UFCS</a>, the throwOnFailure(response) syntax can be rewritten as response.throwOnFailure(). This makes it integrate seemlessly with other built-in methods like send(). I may have abused this feature throughout the project.</p>



<p>D pretty much favors exceptions when it comes to error handling. The rationale is explained in detail <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/errors.html#the_d_error_handling_solution">here</a>. One of the things I like about it is that unhandled errors will eventually get reported unless explicitely silenced. This is why I was able to get away with simplistic error handling. For example, in these lines :</p>

<pre>string token = response.jsonBody
    ["data"].object
    ["createSession"].object
    ["token"].str;
configuration.put("token", token);
</pre>

<p>If the response body didn't contain the token object, or any of the objects leading to it, it will throw an exception that will bubble up to the main function, then explode in the face of the user. If I had been using Go, I would have had to be very careful about handling the errors at every stage. And to be honest, since it's annoying to write if err != null every time I call a function, I would be very tempted to just ignore it. My understanding of Go is however primitive and I wouldn't be surprised if the compiler barked at you for not doing anything with the error return value, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<p>Rust style error handling as explained in the original post was interesting. I don't think D has anything like that in the standard library, but there <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/thread/kjkosvfljzfyquhdzbbr@forum.dlang.org">have</a> <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/thread/mcodusbzzthlkcwstrjp@forum.dlang.org">been</a> <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/thread/apphidjekselhhctclgr@forum.dlang.org">discussions</a> about implementing it as a third party library.</p>



<p>I just want to quickly mention that I didn't use websockets to implement the "watch" command. I tried using Vibe.d's websocket client, but I couldn't get to work with the hashtrack backend because it kept closing the connection. I …</p></div></div>

And although this statement is universally accepted by those who study and theorize about gender, there is a lot of confusion about it among those who do not.&nbsp;</p><p>The confusion stems from the fact that males and females of many species systematically behave in different ways. Perhaps the most basic example is the act of mating. To have different sexes in a species simply means to have different variants that make different-sized gametes (eggs and sperm, for example). This often means different body types adapted to getting these gametes together efficiently (like penises and vaginas). And these body types necessitate different mating strategies (like mounting and presenting).</p><p>In some parts of the animal kingdom, sexually differentiated behavior goes beyond the act of mating. Sometimes only one sex will care for the young. Other species have sex-specific mating and courtship strategies, like harem defense by male gorillas, or mating dances. In still others, males and females have different patterns for sociality, as in big-horned sheep, which have sex-segregated herds.</p><blockquote><p>When little boys reject dolls, we do not learn about their innate abilities to care for infants.</p> </blockquote><p>How are these behaviors different from gender? Why don’t they count? To answer this question we, of course, need an understanding of what gender is, and this can be a bit tricky. The term gender has been used in many ways, and for many purposes. This, in itself, is not a problem. Gender is complex and multi-faceted, and it makes perfect sense for people to address different aspects of it in different ways. (Though the complexity of the idea likely contributes to the confusion at the heart of this article—over whether animals have gender.) How can we understand it?<br></p><p>It wasn’t until the 1950s that the psychologist John Money started using the term “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13260820/" target="_blank">gender role</a>” to refer to something that associates with biological sex, but is not the same. From there, a theoretical distinction emerged where sex refers to facts about biological bodies. Gender, on the other hand, is cultural. It involves a set of behaviors and norms that shape how men and women act, prescribe how they ought to be, and specify what it means to be a man or a woman. These behaviors and norms emerge as a result of cultural evolution, and are transmitted to new generations through cultural learning. (Notice here that I implicitly refer to a two-gender system. I am not making a political point. This is just the most common type of system across cultures, traditionally.)</p><p>As gender theorists like <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UczySqq19AIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=bodies+that+matter+butler&amp;ots=sd_SmATU-F&amp;sig=94IafeGJBsKlZTGIjUvZzL8YVmM#v=onepage&amp;q=bodies%20that%20matter%20butler&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Judith Butler</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexing_the_Body" target="_blank">Anne Fausto-Sterling</a> have pointed out, sex and gender cannot be fully pulled apart. Facts about our sexed bodies influence the cultural rules surrounding gender. (For instance, in many cultures it is a norm that men, who are typically males, do jobs that require a lot of upper body strength.) And facts about gender in turn shape our sexed bodies. (For instance, norms of what is attractive lead to different patterns of exercise, like weightlifting for men and running on the elliptical for women.) And these feedback on each other. (When men only weightlift, this creates further sex differences that reinforce our cultural norms.) But despite this intertwining, peacocks still do not have genders. And the reason is that peacocks do not have culture.</p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>How do we know that gender is not simply a biological fact? What makes it cultural, rather than analogous to sex-differentiated behavior in animals? Here is some of the key evidence. Unlike in any other animal, gendered behavior in humans is wildly different across cultures. What is considered appropriate for women in one culture might be deemed completely inappropriate in another. Even the number of genders is culturally variable. While most cultures have settled on two genders, associated with biological sex differences, others settle on three or more.</p><p>Relatedly, the rules and patterns of gender change over time. While in the early 1900s women in the United States were forbidden from wearing trousers, it is now perfectly acceptable to do so. And while pink is now considered the color of femininity in the Western world, this association only <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/08/pink-wasnt-always-girly/278535/" target="_blank">emerged recently</a>. In other words, there is a lot of arbitrariness to gender—it is flexible, it can be done in many ways. And this indicates that it is deeply shaped by culture.&nbsp;</p><p>A few puzzles remain, though. First—don’t animals have cultures? And, if so, couldn’t they have genders, too? Culture relies on the transmission of learning and information from generation to generation. This allows stable patterns of useful behavior to emerge and persist. And it allows us to build up cultural knowledge over these generations. Some animals can engage in this sort of learning, at least in a limited way. Killer whales, for example, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2091134-orcas-are-first-non-humans-whose-evolution-is-driven-by-culture/" target="_blank">learn how to hunt</a> from each other, and different groups develop different strategies for killing prey. In a famous case, a band of Japanese macaques <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-015-0492-0" target="_blank">learned to wash</a> sweet potatoes after one female started doing so.</p><p>But genuine examples of animal culture are relatively rare, and do not involve sex-specific patterns of behavior and learning the way human gender does. We do not, for instance, see killer whale pods where females learn special behaviors only from females, and pass these on only to other females. Even if we did, this sort of proto-gender would be missing many of the key features of human gender systems. Most importantly, human gender systems involve <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Framed_by_Gender.html?id=NqoWmrAoQn0C" target="_blank">healthy doses of normativity</a>—not only do women behave a certain way by dint of their cultural training, but we agree as a society that they should behave that way. This element is absent from animal cultures.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is another puzzle, though. If gender is a cultural construction, why is it so pervasive? Why does every studied society have patterns of behavior, and norms, surrounding how men and women should act? Wouldn’t we expect at least some cultures to do without it? And, if so, is it maybe more innate and biological than we think?</p><p>The answer here is that gender has emerged so widely because it has been extremely useful in allowing human groups to <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Origins_of_Unfairness.html?id=3Kc-wAEACAAJ" target="_blank">divide labor</a>. Over cultural evolutionary time, humans develop skills that are crucial for survival, but often difficult and time-consuming to learn. In traditional cultures, this might involve things like making rope, gathering and processing food, constructing houses, and firing pottery. Gender provides a set of rules that pick out different classes of people, and specify that these different people are supposed to do different jobs. Of course, we can, and do, divide labor in other ways, but biological sex differences make gender an especially convenient way to do it. We don’t need gender to solve division of labor problems, but it is such an accessible solution that basically every culture develops some form of it. And once gendered division of labor is in place, rituals, meanings, expectations, norms, and all sorts of cultural baggage can accumulate.</p><p>All of this raises a thorny question. If gender is cultural, is that what explains all differences in the behaviors of men and women? Do humans have sexually differentiated behaviors like animals do, or not? This question is thorny because in answering it one almost necessarily informs issues related to sexism, discrimination, and inequity. If there are innate behavioral differences between males and females, this provides grounds to argue that we need not treat men and women fairly. A classic example involves claims that women are less competitive than men, and so the relatively small number of women CEOs is not a problem.&nbsp;</p><p>There are likely some innate behavioral differences between human males and females, but the extent of these are extremely hard to gauge. Cultural influence shapes the gendered behavior of every human on this planet, meaning we cannot measure innate sex differences absent cultural factors. There is no control group.</p><p>This returns us to why it is so important to recognize that animals do not have genders. When we see different behaviors in men and women, we cannot infer, as we can with animals, that these behaviors emerge from innate biological differences. When little boys reject dolls, we do not learn about their innate abilities to care for infants. Instead, we have to see this sort of behavior in humans through an entirely different lens, that recognizes how important our cultural systems are in determining what we do as men and women, boys and girls.</p><p><i><a href="http://nautil.us/blog/minority-groups-lose-when-they-collaborate-with-power" target="_blank">Cailin O’Connor</a> is a philosopher and evolutionary game theorist and Associate Professor in the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science at U.C.

In The Selfish Gene, the author looks at life through the eyes of our genes. Richard Dawkins writes that genes are internal dictators who set the policy of our bodies. Genes are called selfish for a simple reason – they manipulate our behavior to make sure they will survive.</p><h2 id="1-the-core-idea-"><strong>The Core Idea:</strong></h2><p>Though the book is called The Selfish Gene, the text unfolds something else – that actually altruism should be (and in most cases is) the driving behavior of all living creatures. Yet again, the main motive behind an act of kindness is never 100% genuine. Collaborating and helping is promoted by our internal programmers to ensure that our genes will be passed on to future generations. By helping others, we increase our chances of receiving help from them in the future. Thus, the likelihood of our genetic material moving forward multiplies.</p><div id=""><div><div><div><div><div><h2 id="2-highlights">Highlights:</h2><ul><li>The best way to transport your genes forward, except taking care of your body, is taking care of others around you.</li><li>Our bodies are pre-programmed by our genes.

Don’t worry, your body is not as confused as you are. The cells circling around your blood know exactly what they have to do during the time they occupy the current corpse – to survive and replicate.</p><p>In the book, our bodies are described as throwaway survival machines where they simply exist to transport our genes forward. I know, harsh. As if our thoughts and ambitions don’t matter. But if you think about it, on a larger scale, we, the individuals, exist for so little. Nature is careless of your desires but very interested in making sure you’ll move your genetic material forward. That’s the only way we can pass on important information to others and continue to evolve.</p><p>According to the author, this self-centered outlook of the genes gives rise to selfishness in individual behavior.</p><p>Or in other words, we’re born selfish. Throughout our whole lives, we are looking for ways to satisfy our own selfish needs without taking much consideration of what the people around us want and need.</p><p>Eventually, it turns out, that these needs are not even ours – they are the desires of the genes driving the vehicle (i.e. our bodies).</p><blockquote><p>I shall argue that the fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group, nor even, strictly, the individual. It is the gene, the unit of heredity.” Richard Dawkins</p></blockquote><h3 id="5-lesson-2-we-care-and-help-others-to-ensure-our-own-survival-"><strong>Lesson #2: We Care and Help Others To Ensure Our Own Survival</strong></h3><p>If our genes, and we, are selfish, why do we then help others?</p><p>There are countless examples mentioned in the book where animals help other animals. And while at first sight, their behavior seems like it’s remarkably noble, when examining the situation, it’s clear that there are hidden motives.</p><p>When a chick finds food, its informing others by tweeting – the so-called “food call”. When bats find blood, they tend to give the extra supply to neighbors who were unable to find food that specific night.</p><p>Why such altruistic behavior exist in nature? Shouldn’t all living creaturs focus on their own survival and neglect other forms of living?</p><p>Natural selection shaped our behavior to help another living organism for a simple reason – when we help others, especially if these others are relatives, we ensure that more of our genes will move forward.</p><p>Therefore, we share food with our relatives, no so much because they are our cousins, sisters, or close friends, but because our selfish genes want to support part of our genes. Furthermore, when we help those who are in need, they’ll likely return the favor when we’re in a difficult situation.</p><blockquote><p>If there is a human moral to be drawn, it is that we must teach our children altruism, for we cannot expect it to be part of their biological nature.” Richard Dawkins</p></blockquote><h3 id="6-lesson-3-navigating-in-the-world-is-influenced-by-our-pre-programmed-knowledge-"><strong>Lesson #3: Navigating in The World is Influenced by Our Pre-Programmed Knowledge</strong></h3><p>When a child is born, he/she doesn’t start from scratch. Yes, a lot of things have to be learned but there are certain traits embedded in the genes of the newborn.</p><p>Thanks to the acquired wisdom from the cells inside us, we define some things as rewarding and others as unpleasant unconsciously even before learning how to walk. Or as the author mentions in the book, “One way for genes to solve the problem of making predictions in rather unpredictable environments is to build in a capacity for learning. Here the program may take the form of the following instructions to the survival machine: ‘Here is a list of things defined as rewarding: sweet taste in the mouth, orgasm, mild temperature, smiling child. And here is a list of nasty things: various sorts of pain, nausea, empty stomach, screaming child.”</p><p>These instructions given by our genes, while very basic, send impulses to our bodies and influence our actions. When facing an unfamiliar situation, if we’re young, and we don’t have a lot of experience with living, we use the hard-coded rules set by our genes to make a decision.</p><p>The main advantage of these inherited traits is that they greatly cut down the number of rules and guides that have to be learned by the individual to remain alive. However, they are not enough to handle the sophisticated obstacles set by nature and by the other inhabitants.</p><p>Naturally, to get better at predicting the future and endure longer, we need to increase our knowledge and to accumulate more strategies.</p><h3 id="7-lesson-4-similar-to-genes-ideas-also-endure-time-and-move-forward-"><strong>Lesson #4: Similar to Genes, Ideas Also Endure Time And Move Forward</strong></h3><p>Something else is able to withstand time besides our genetic material – our culture. Dawkins calls the collective knowledge of humanity memes (from the Greek, Mimeme).</p><p>Imagine ideas, tunes, best-practices in architecture, even fashion trends.</p><p>Thanks to the ideas and the knowledge we have inherited from our ancestors, our life doesn’t start from scratch when we’re born. This is partly thanks to our genes and partly from the wisdom we accumulate during our life spawn.</p><p>While surviving and replicating is probably your most important goal, it’s very basic for our subtle brains. To make sense of your existence, and to make the world a better place, you also need to create ideas that are so good, that other individuals will happily share them with others.</p><p>So, it’s of evolutionary importance to pursue important ideas and also “plant” them in other people’s heads.</p><p>But how? How can you make an idea so good, that other people will happily help you transport it past your own fragile life?</p><p>Richard Dawkins explains, “Consider the idea of God. Why does it have such high survival value? What is it about the idea of a god that gives it its stability and penetrance in the cultural environment? The survival value of the god meme in the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal. It provides a superficially plausible answer to deep and troubling questions about existence. It suggests that injustices in this world may be rectified in the next.”</p><p>To produce memes that are fertile, such that achieve long-term success and get accepted by the general population, you need to think about helping others.</p><p>You need to think in terms of making the gene pool, or in this case the meme pool, a better place. That’s the only way you can ensure that your thoughts and ambitions will be passed on to future generations.</p><blockquote><p>When you plant a fertile meme in my mind you literally parasitize my brain, turning it into a vehicle for the meme’s propagation in just the way that a virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell.” Richard Dawkins</p></blockquote><h3 id="8-lesson-5-life-is-riddled-with-iterated-prisoner%E2%80%99s-dilemma-games-"><strong>Lesson #5: Life is Riddled With Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma Games</strong></h3><p>To help us understand the importance of collaborating with each other, on a molecular level, and in general, the author makes a great association with a simple gambling game called Prisoner’s Dilemma.</p><p>In short, here’s how the game is played as explained in the book:</p><p>There is something at stake. For example, two men are in custody. Each of them is interrogated by guards in a separate cell and forced to betray his colleague (defect). If one decides to do so, he will be free, but his partner will remain in prison for at least 5 years. The same deal is offered to the other prisoner. Here is where it gets interesting: if they both decide to blame the other party – both of them defect – they’ll both spend 3 years in jail. The opportunity here lies in remaining quiet (cooperating). If they don’t say a word, they will spend 1 year in prison.</p><p>Of course, the temptation to blame the other party is high because you don’t know what he will do. So, naturally, most subjects choose to defect. This way, they guarantee that they won’t be the sucker, they won’t receive a huge sentence, and they will not let the other person out free.</p><p>But is this the right approach in this hypothetical game and also in life?</p><p>According to the research done by the author, collaborating always leads to more benefits in the long-run.</p><p>But not blindly helping. The strategy that won’t the “tournament” in the book is called Tit for Tat. You begin by cooperating on the first move and thereafter you simply copy the previous move of the other player. When the other party collaborates, you do the same on the next move. If he defects, you repeat. Mathematically speaking, if points are attached to the moves, the high-score for both of the players is reached only by collaborating – never by trying to trick each other.</p><p>Genes that survive and are able to last for enough generation, are ones that are able to collaborate with other genes. But not only. They also retaliate when attacked. They do their best to make the environment around them …</p></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>

In this piece, we’ll take a look at some of the many handy GraphQL tools that make using it even more worthwhile. Bear in mind there’s quite a few of them so we’re not going to get through the lot of them in one go.</p>
<h2>Prisma</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, working with GraphQL will require you to set up a database. Well, there’s also BaaS so you can outsource it, but what if you don’t want to? This is where Prisma comes in, it’s a clever middle ground between doing it yourself and outsourcing.
<strong>Prisma is an ORM library</strong> that lets you interact with the database from the server in the language you choose. So if you want to write to your MySQL database you don’t have to do it in SQL, Prima lets you do it in Python, JavaScript or some other language you prefer. </p>
<p>You might think: <em>“Yeah, but that’s just what a regular ORM library does”</em>. True, but Prisma comes with a few added functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>database agnostic: Prisma currently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and AWS Aurora, with more to come soon,</li>
<li>supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Flow, and Go,</li>
<li>provides premade basic CRUD queries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relay</h2>
<p><strong>Relay is a JavaScript framework</strong> created by Facebook for fetching and managing GraphQL data. Relay is supposed to be the go-to tool for GraphQL users with a focus on validating and optimizing your code. Another focal point is being a <strong>bridge between GraphQL and React</strong>. Relay lets you set up your data requirements using GraphQL and then it will handle the fetching, collecting queries into network requests to get you exactly what you wanted.</p>
<p>Relay is composed of three main loosely coupled modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relay Compiler: a GraphQL compiler that analyzes, validates, and optimizes GraphQL in your code.</li>
<li>Relay Runtime: a full-featured GraphQL runtime for building higher level client APIs</li>
<li>Relay/React: a product API that integrates Relay Runtime with React</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apollo</h2>
<p><strong>The APOLLO platform</strong> is an implementation of GraphQL that transfers data from the server to your UI. <strong>Apollo-client</strong> is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that lets you manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. The aim is to enable you to build UI components that fetch data via GraphQL. <strong>Apollo-server</strong> is a quick way for building an API for GraphQL using data from any source by using a spec-compliant server that can be queried from any GraphQL client, including the Apollo-client. </p>
<p>Let’s look at the Apollo-client features:</p>
<ul>
<li>a declarative approach to data fetching, all the logic for retrieving data, tracking, loading and uploading it to the UI is contained in a single query,</li>
<li>designed for modern React, the Apollo client takes advantage of the latest React features such as hooks,</li>
<li>adaptable, can be dropped into any JavaScript app seamlessly,</li>
<li>universally compatible, can be used with any GraphQL API.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Following my last tutorial on Vim, “<a href="https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/5-most-essential-vim-commands-for-beginners/">5 Most Essential Vim Commands for
Beginners</a>” if you haven’t read make sure to check it out. In this article,
I wanted to share one of the most useful commands you may find trivial to use
in any text editor and that is a substitute command. If you have used <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime
Text</a>, chances are you have used Replace toolbar, which find and replace the
desired string or all occurrences of the string in the current file, well, that’s just what
substitute does. At any point in your coding career, you will find your self in
a need to change a large selection of strings. Doing it manually is one
solution, doing it pragmatically is another better solution. And Vim offers an
extremely fast and efficient way of doing it with the substitute command.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>Substitute command is invoked from the command mode, by calling <code>:s</code>, which
stands for s[ubstitute]. But before any executions, it’s better to start with
reading the Vim’s documentation for the better get knowing.</p>
<pre><code>:help :substitute
</code></pre><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">:<span>[</span>range<span>]</span>s<span>[</span>ubstitute<span>]</span>/<span>{</span>pattern<span>}</span>/<span>{</span>string<span>}</span>/<span>[</span>flags<span>]</span> <span>[</span>count<span>]</span>
For each line in <span>[</span>range<span>]</span> replace a match of <span>{</span>pattern<span>}</span> with <span>{</span>string<span>}</span>.
For the <span>{</span>pattern<span>}</span> see pattern.
<span>{</span>string<span>}</span> can be a literal string, or something special; see
sub-replace-special.
When <span>[</span>range<span>]</span> and <span>[</span>count<span>]</span> are omitted, replace in the current line only.  When
<span>[</span>count<span>]</span> is given, replace in <span>[</span>count<span>]</span> lines, starting with the last line in
<span>[</span>range<span>]</span>.
When <span>[</span>range<span>]</span> is omitted start in the current line. E939
<span>[</span>count<span>]</span> must be a positive number.  Also, see cmdline-ranges.
See :s_flags <span>for</span> <span>[</span>flags<span>]</span>.
The delimiter doesn<span>'</span>t need to be /, see pattern-delimiter.</code></pre></div>
<p>So basically, the most basic usage would be:</p>
<pre><code>:s/search/replace
</code></pre><h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="find-and-replace-the-first-occurrence-in-the-current-line">Find and replace the first occurrence in the current line</h3>
<p>When the range parameter is not provided to the function, it will find and
replace only the first occurrence in the current line:</p>
<pre><code>:s/search/replace
</code></pre><h3 id="find-and-replace-all-occurrences">Find and replace all occurrences</h3>
<p>By adding the percentage sign in front of the s we are giving the max range, so
the function will look up through the whole file and replace them:</p>
<pre><code>:%s/search/replace
</code></pre><h3 id="find-and-replace-all-occurrences-in-the-range-of-lines">Find and replace all occurrences in the range of lines</h3>
<p>We can also limit the function lookup only to some lines [start, end], which
will find and replace all the occurrences only inside those lines:</p>
<pre><code>:1,10s/search/replace
</code></pre><h3 id="change-only-whole-words-exactly-matching">Change only whole words exactly matching</h3>
<p>To avoid removing wrong selections, we can select only the whole words using
regex:</p>
<pre><code>:%s/\&lt;foo\&gt;/bar/
</code></pre><h2 id="flags">Flags</h2>
<p>Flags offer some caution and control in executing the substitute command, for
example:</p>
<h3 id="global-g">Global (g)</h3>
<p>This flag will look throughout the whole files, assuming the default setting
for the ‘gdefault’ and ‘edcompatible’ option is off.</p>
<pre><code>:%s/search/replace/g
</code></pre><h3 id="confirmation-c">Confirmation (c)</h3>
<p>By adding c flag the command will ask for confirmation for every occurrence
before changing.</p>
<pre><code>:s/search/replace/c
</code></pre><h3 id="insensitive-i">Insensitive (i)</h3>
<p>This will set up case insensitive lookup order.</p>
<pre><code>:s/search/replace/i
</code></pre><h3 id="sensitive-i">Sensitive (I)</h3>
<p>Meanwhile capital I will set up case insensitive lookup order.</p>
<pre><code>:s/search/replace/I
</code></pre><h2 id="conslusion">Conslusion</h2>
<p>This is the most basic usage of the substitute command, for the more advance
usage I recommend reading the documentation and <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace">Vim Fandom article</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[Rust-Style Futures in C]]>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>All networking applications essentially boil down to stringing together
multiple asynchronous calls in the <em>right</em> way.
Traditionally for programs written in C this would be done through
registering callbacks where the callee either handles the event itself
or dispatches through a state machine.
In such implementations however reasoning about memory safety
can be treacherous, with it sometimes requiring full-program knowledge.
Futures, or promises, as they are also referred to,
ease in that regard by allowing asynchronous programs
to be written in direct style, keeping the control flow linear.</p>

<p>All things considered, I do think that futures can be a good fit
for C programming under the right circumstances.
I also hope this article can serve to help one understand Rust futures,
by being a separate reference that only touches the fundamentals.</p>

<p>The Rust futures story is especially interesting because it is
fundamentally different from the usual workings of futures
in functional languages or, say, JavaScript.
Whereas other implementations are <em>push</em>-based -
meaning you give a function to be pushed to with
the resolved result of the future -
Rust futures are <em>poll</em>-based.
Let us see how this looks in C with the simplification
that we limit ourselves to a single task,
i.e. one top-level future running on one thread.
This is common in embedded programming, and still <em>fairly</em> manageable
without the security guarantees given by Rust.
<a href="https://libuv.org/">libuv</a> is used for the event loop.
No heap allocations will be required - it is all downhill from here
(Get it? Because the stack grows down.) -
other than those imposed by the libuv interface.</p>

<p>The main <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html"><code>std::future::Future</code></a> trait
translated into C as a virtual method table becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>{</span> <span>POLL_PENDING</span><span>,</span> <span>POLL_READY</span> <span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>poll</span><span>)(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>);</span>

	<span>// For now let's skip this method</span>
	<span>// void (*drop)(struct Future *self, struct Context *ctx);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As an example, let us consider the simplest case:
A future that immediately resolves with the number <code>4</code>,</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>*</span><span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>self</span><span>;</span>
	<span>self</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>future</span><span>;</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>simpleFuture</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>future</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>poll</span> <span>=</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>,</span> <span>}</span> <span>};</span>

<span>// ... and in the event loop</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>simpleFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>);</span> <span>// =&gt; POLL_READY</span>
<span>// Here we can now use the result</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>result</span> <span>// =&gt; 4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To <em>attempt</em> to resolve the future, we poll it;
it returns <code>POLL_READY</code> and as such we are done.
And for futures that instead return <code>POLL_PENDING</code> when polled,
we just make sure to poll them again later -
futures are lazy and do not make progress unless actively told to do so.
No one knows better than the future itself when it should
be polled again - <em>awoken</em> -
so the context given to all futures allows them to awake their own task.
With many parallel tasks the additional complexity would make itself apparent here,
but in our case something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>;</span>
	<span>uv_loop_t</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>wakeTask</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>);</span> <span>// Finished!</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>will suffice.
Polling the future once at startup will then kick off the machinery.</p>

<p>For a libuv timer future, we would want to write something like</p>

<p>The timer handle is made to hold a reference to the future in
its user data field,
so that the callback knows which future to toggle the status on.
However this requires the future object to be pinned in memory,
moving it would make the reference dangling.
Rust deals with this unsafety using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/index.html">Pin construct</a>,
that wraps a pointer type, <code>P</code>,
and only permits operations that cannot move the pointee
(for cases where it may not always be safe to do so, i.e. <code>P: !Unpin</code>)
and ensures its memory remains valid until it gets dropped,
or helps make manually vetted code <em>nonleaky</em>.
In C there is no such thing;
the closest you will get is with a red paragraph buried in the documentation.
This means treading with care,
allocating storage for the main future once and never copying it, and
only referring to futures with pointers to their static place in memory.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to get by with just one global <code>uv_timer_t</code>
by recognizing that whenever the main future is awoken either:
(I) A timer, necessarily the one with smallest timeout, fired;
or (II) All timers need be dropped and reset, since the futures form a tree,
as we will see.</p>

<h2 id="after-you">After you</h2>

<p>Running multiple futures sequentially is just a matter of
constructing a new future that polls each future to completion,
one after the other.
The poll method of the outer future will have to return <code>POLL_PENDING</code>
after each intermediate step,
before continuing where it left off - like a coroutine.
Rust turns each future into a state machine,
and doing the same in C means playing the part of the Rust compiler.
An adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">Duff’s device</a>,
as <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">described by Simon Tatham</a>,
can help cut down on the boilerplate.
The idea is that with a <code>switch</code> statement enveloping the whole function-body,
you can yield by creating a unique label using the <code>__LINE__</code> macro
where execution will begin upon reentry,
setting the switch-expression as such, and returning.
The following macros do just that</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>Coroutine</span><span>;</span>

<span>#define COR_START(s) switch (*(s)) { case 0:;
#define COR_YIELD(s, r) do {*(s) = __LINE__; return (r); case __LINE__:;} while(0)
#define COR_END }
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>where <code>s</code> is a pointer to the coroutine state.
Great care has to be taken because when returning all locals are invalidated -
if only there was a language that could statically check for such mistakes.
Awaiting then becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#define AWAIT(s, ctx, fut) while ((fut)-&gt;poll((fut), (ctx)) == POLL_PENDING) \
	COR_YIELD((s), POLL_PENDING)
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>that is, yielding until the given future is resolved.</p>

<p>To illustrate, here is a future that prints four times to standard output,
first thrice at one second intervals, and then again after two more seconds:</p>

<p>Note that the local <code>i</code> had to be spilled to the future struct
in order to persist across yield points,
and that unions are used to show what variables are active at each step,
and squeeze out that last driblet of performance even in the face of
uncompromising undefined behaviour threats from all directions.</p>

<h2 id="off-to-the-races">Off to the races</h2>

<p>In a similar vein, multiple futures can be made to run in parallel
using a future combinator whose poll method polls all of its children
and either waits for all to complete - <em>joins</em> them,
or selects the first to become ready.
The latter is a tad more difficult, so let us focus on that.
The reason is that after the first future has resolved,
the rest may still be running, their memory possibly referenced elsewhere.
This is where the <code>drop()</code> method that we have skimmed over comes in.
Dropping a pinned object should relax the constraint
that its memory remains valid.
The drop implementation of <code>TimerFuture</code> above could for example
call <code>uv_timer_stop()</code> so the callback never fires
or overwrite the dangling reference to the future with <code>NULL</code>.
For other types, since their drop implementations are …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Breaking your solutions up into manageable chunks (libraries) is one of the most important aspects of code maintainability. This article is .NET centric, but the principle applies to any technology and packaging manager such as NPM. Generally speaking, a library (or project/assembly in the .NET world) should only be concerned with one thing and should have as few external dependencies as possible. This leads to a situation where you will have a mesh of dependencies. The simplest way to deal with this is to keep all projects in a single repo under a single solution. However, if you’re doing something right, other people in your organization or the general public will want to use some of your libraries. The question is, should they reference them as NuGet packages? Or, as Git Submodules? This article discusses some pros, cons, and pitfalls of both.</p>



<p>Just a little heads up. This topic will probably end up spanning a few posts because dependency management is very complicated!</p>



<h2>Some Scenarios</h2>



<p>Let’s take a look at my scenario. I created an app called&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/hardfolio/9p8xx70n5d2j">Hardfolio</a>. It is a cryptocurrency portfolio app that gathers balances for multiple currencies. It is available on the Google Play Store, the Microsoft Store, and talks to two different cryptocurrency hardwarewallets:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://trezor.io/">Trezor</a>, and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://shapeshift.com/keepkey">KeepKey</a>. The app started it’s life in a single repo with a few different projects. As I worked through building the app, I noticed a clear delineation between the layers of the app: USB/Hid, cryptocurrency APIs, and the rest. I hunted around for 3rd party, cross-platform libraries to fill in the abstractions for this, but there were none. A few libraries roughly did the job, but nothing that worked across platforms, so I separated the code into multiple repos in the hope that the community would contribute. This is how the dependency graph looks.</p>



<p><em>Note: this app is languishing and requires funding, so hit me up if you want to help me relaunch it.</em></p>

<p>I started out testing the projects individually and then launching them on NuGet.org. The problem I ran in to straight away was that every time I needed to change some little detail, I needed to rerelease the dependencies on NuGet.org. It simply isn’t feasible for USB libraries because the testing process is very onerous. I need to physically connect devices to my computer to do integration tests. The public interface was not stable, and I was still making refactors that ripple through all the dependencies. On top of this, debugging wasn’t working. I believe that I could have solved this by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/symbol-packages-snupkg">including debugging symbols</a>&nbsp;in the NuGet package, but I’m still not sure if this is best practice for public releases.</p>



<p>I would make a change somewhere, and then when I went to do a release for one of the libraries, I would find that the library was broken somewhere. So, I more or less gave up and dragged the projects into the main solution directly. It immediately gave me the ability to do mass refactors across the board, and no need to add PDB files to the NuGet package. This was the key – being able to do refactoring across all libraries. But, I still had loose ends all over the place because I had to manually take care of making sure that changes in a given library made its way into a NuGet version. This was a nightmare to manage. This is the problem that submodules solve. More on that to come…</p>



<p>Recently, I worked at a company where we moved common libraries into a NuGet feed that we all shared. We put this into a DevOps pipeline that automatically versioned the NuGet package. Immediately, we ran into the same problem. The public interfaces of the common libraries were not stable, so refactors often broke libraries that depended on them. But, even when it did become stable, you still have to wait for the pipeline to build and deploy your change before you can access new APIs. I don’t believe it’s appropriate to publish Nuget packages while a public interface is constantly changing. I believe that submodules are more appropriate in this case.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Publishing Artifacts Automatically</h2>



<p>You can read about Azure artifacts&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/artifacts/artifacts-overview?view=azure-devops" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, and you can read about deploying them via a pipeline&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/artifacts?view=azure-devops" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Ultimately, if you want to publish APIs, you need to version them and put them in some pipeline. There’s no avoiding this. The pipeline will need to deploy to a Nuget feed such as Nuget.org or your company’s DevOps artifacts feed for most of us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, nothing stops you from working with submodules instead during periods where you are not regularly releasing to an audience. If you are working within an organization, you may decide not to publish code to a Nuget feed. You can break your code up into manageable repos. This is not an excuse for not testing a particular version and not having&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumer-driven contracts</a>&nbsp;that guarantee some given public interface quality. It just means that versioning is driven by commit Id rather than build version.</p>



<h2>What is a Git Submodule?</h2>



<blockquote><p>Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.</p><cite><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>A submodule is essentially just a pointer to a commit in a different Git repo. When you initialize the submodule, it clones the repo into a subfolder, and the repo can act as a standard git repo. You can commit, push, and check out branches in this repo. The base repo will keep track of the commit on these submodules and monitor if the submodule has uncommitted changes. Any changes in the submodules will be considered as a change in the base repo.</p>



<p>A key to understanding submodules is that a commit in your repo encompasses all the necessary commits in the external submodules. As long as all changes in the tree of repos are committed, your most recent commit id guarantees that the code can be reproduced. Unless of course someone deletes commits in the submodule repos, but this is poor form anyway.</p>



<h2>How Do I Add a Submodule?</h2>



<p>git submodule add [INSERT REPO URL]</p>



<p>For example, I added Device.Net as a submodule of Trezor.Net with this command:</p>



<p>git submodule add <a href="https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net.git" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net.git</a></p>



<p>This clones the Device.Net repo into a subfolder of Trezor.Net, and then I am free to reference the Device.Net projects from Trezor.Net directly. This adds a file called .gitmodules and looks like this:</p>



<p>[submodule “Device.Net”]<br>path = Device.Net<br>url = <a href="https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net.git" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Device.Net.git</a></p>



<p>It also adds a git history pointer commit to the submodule repo that looks like this.</p>



<p>Commit 8642e094850b3c1a1d65f0195e963353de68d2d9<br>Commit MessageUpdate README.md</p>



<p>Full documentation <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules" data-type="URL" data-id="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">here</a>.</p>



<h2>A Note on Workflow</h2>



<p>A full explanation of my workflow will need to come in a follow-up article, but the crux is this. I break libraries up into repos based on the community that might be interested in the code. For example, Device.Net will be attractive to any community that needs to communicate with USB devices. But, most of them won’t need Trezor.Net because that’s specific to the crypto community. Conversely, the crypto community is not interested in USB communication specifics, so all that USB code was moved out of Trezor.Net</p>



<p>When I create an app or framework, I pull in all the repos as submodules that I need. I do this on the develop branch. They are sometimes my own libraries, but can also be libraries of others. I then manage the commits to all the repos. It helps to have a tool like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken&nbsp;</a>because it allows you to keep multiple repo tabs open, and switch between submodules as tabs. On the release branch, I switch to Nuget dependencies so that if a community member clones the repo, they will be pointing the live Nuget. Developers expect live Nugets so you still need to version your Nugets. Developers don’t want to have to clone a Github repo to use the dependencies.</p>



<h2>Pitfalls</h2>



<ul><li>You need to be vigilant with all repos. If you don’t commit on one of the repos, you may end up with unreproducable code.</li><li>When you release any library that points to a submodule, you will probably need to create NuGet release versions for all the submodule libraries. You will then need to point the highest level library to these NuGet dependencies manually or through some automated process.</li><li>Unit tests at all levels are critical. You need to have some level of confidence that you can do a release of any of the dependencies at any point in time</li><li>I haven’t personally tested submodules within a build pipeline, but there is no reason why it shouldn’t work. You may want to create an automated process that strips the direct project references and replaces them with Nuget versions when the code hits release branch.</li></ul>



<h2>Wrap-up</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the reality is that if your libraries are public-facing or you are in a large organization that depends on your code, you will need to manage NuGet versioning, and this is not a bad thing. But, you can use submodules to make this easier – especially when the dependencies are in a state of constant flux. It’s not an either-or situation. Carefully managed submodules increase simplicity and allow you to break your repos up more readily.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>Recently, I have created a small utility to schedule&nbsp; a daily alert notification to the user based on data retrieved from one of my <strong>MySql</strong> database table (<strong>Alerts</strong> table: which contains messages related to my application level violations). In this post, I will explain how that can be achieved in few steps using a simple PowerShell script.</p>
<h2>Step 1: PowellShell script (database-alerts.ps1) for reading data from MySql Database &amp; Sending email</h2>
<p><strong>Script (database-alerts.ps1):</strong> In this script, we are connecting to database (techcartnow), reading today’s messages form alerts table &amp; sending emails if there are any violation messages retrieved from database.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="powershell">Try
{
  [void][system.reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom(“C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\Connector NET 8.0\Assemblies\v4.5.2\MySQL.Data.dll”)

  #Create a variable to hold the connection:
  $myconnection = New-Object MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlConnection

  #Set the connection string:
  $myconnection.ConnectionString = "Data Source=127.0.0.1; Initial Catalog=techcartnow; uid=root; Password=root; Port=3306"

  #Call the Connection object’s Open() method:
  $myconnection.Open()
  
  $SMTPServer = "smtp.office365.com"
  $SMTPClient = New-Object Net.Mail.SmtpClient($SmtpServer, 587)
    
  Try
  {
    $command = $myconnection.CreateCommand()
    
    $command.CommandText = "SELECT Message FROM alerts where DATE(CreatedDateUtc) = DATE(UTC_DATE());";

    $reader = $command.ExecuteReader()
    #The data reader will now contain the results from the database query.

    #Processing the Contents of a Data Reader
    #The contents of a data reader is processes row by row:

    $Body = "";

    while ($reader.Read()) {
      #And then field by field:
      for ($i= 0; $i -lt $reader.FieldCount; $i++) {
      $Body += $reader.GetValue($i).ToString() + [Environment]::NewLine
      }
    }

    if($Body -ne "")
    {
      $EmailFrom = "alert@techcartnow.com"
      $EmailTo = "kapil.khandelwal@techcartnow.com"
      $Subject ="ALERT:: Violation Alert."
      $Body = "Following violation were found: " + [Environment]::NewLine + $Body
      $SMTPClient.EnableSsl = $true
      $SMTPClient.Credentials = New-Object System.Net.NetworkCredential("alert@techcartnow.com", "Password");
      $SMTPClient.Send($EmailFrom, $EmailTo, $Subject, $Body)
    }

    $reader.Close()
    $reader.Dispose()
    write-output "Success"
  }
  Catch
  {
    write-output "Failure:: Innner"
  }
  Finally
  {
    write-output "Cleanup Started"
    $myconnection.Close()
    $myconnection.Dispose()
    $SMTPClient.Dispose()
    write-output "Cleanup Finished"
  }
}
Catch
{
  write-output "Failure:: Outer"
}


</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Change the Database connection &amp; SMTP settings</p>
<h2>Step 2:Use “Windows Task Scheduler” for executing the PowerShell script on daily at a given time.</h2>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/sell_enterprise_0/glengarry.jpg" alt="Alec Baldwin's greatest role was in The Departed don't @ me">
Selling software to the enterprise is hard, rewarding, and nothing like this movie.</p>

<p>The enterprise SaaS industry is booming. Much has been written about how to scale B2C tech, as consumer technology companies such as Google, Facebook, or Netflix enjoy near-monopolies, employ hordes of people, and command appropriately dominant mindshare. A relative lack of material has been written about building enterprise software, particularly from a product &amp; engineering point of view.</p>

<p>In this post series we’ll describe techniques on building an easily sellable SaaS product. To set the stage, we’ll define “enterprise buyers” as companies that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employ 500+ people</li>
  <li>Are prepared to pay around $100,000 or (much) more for strategic products</li>
  <li>Regularly make long-term, multi-year software buying commitments</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enterprise-sales-is-like-marriage">Enterprise Sales is Like Marriage</h2>

<p>SaaS covers a wide spectrum of businesses: from enterprise products that cost tens of millions of dollars over multiple years, to freemium products that start at $10/month. The strategies that help you sell one will not (typically) work for the other. The process of settling on the former product is like getting married: months to years building the relationship, multiple suitors, and meetings with the parents, all with the intention of making a decades long commitment. Buying a $150/year utility SaaS, by comparison, is like a Tinder date that ends with getting busy in the back of a Prius.</p>

<p>Once you see the similarities between enterprise buying and marriage, many dimensions of how to sell high-value SaaS become more clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Like a marriage, it’s important to have integrity. Don’t oversell – put your best foot forward (brush your teeth before the first date!) but have integrity in how you sell yourself (don’t lie about your job, your height, or where you went to school).</li>
  <li>You need to offer something differentiated. Nobody wants to settle – you need to be the best catch in at least one, and preferably multiple important dimensions.</li>
  <li>There are a lot of stakeholders. “Meeting the parents” is a key step in serious dating; meeting your buyer’s Procurement and Infosec teams can be a (disturbingly) similar experience.</li>
  <li>You need to be the right partners for each other. Enterprise sales relies upon product/<strong>customer</strong> fit – you should solve a need for your buyer, and you should be able to actually deliver. A common example: over-selling to a Fortune 500 company as a 40-person company, when you don’t have the stability, maturity, or headcount to deliver the service that they expect. Maybe you all are just meeting at the wrong moment in your lives.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I began my career I didn’t understand this dynamic at all. I imagined that enterprise sales was like trying to meet someone at a bar: look as hot as possible, go to a few steak dinners, dance poorly and hope for the best. Superficial stuff. In reality, building a product that can sell to big-company buyers requires scoring well across a broad constellation of factors: the equivalents of getting a good education, having a steady job, and demonstrating that you know how to clean your apartment. Enterprise buyers expect to be courted, and as a builder you have the tools to put your best foot forward.</p>

<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-an-enterprise-sale">The Anatomy of an Enterprise Sale</h2>

<p>These posts on how to sell to the enterprise are rooted in the core drivers that impact huge software purchases. Understanding these drivers as a product builder can help you navigate the arcane “dating” process behind closing your first (or next) enterprise logo:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spending millions of dollars on a software solution is necessarily a complex process due to the sheer amount of “stuff” going on at a large company.</li>
  <li>Enterprise software deployments have a complex web of stakeholders. The buyer of enterprise software is often different from the user, as software is (often) bought by executives but used by their teams. Decisions on which vendors to use can take on a political dimension, as they can make or break careers.</li>
  <li>Change is <em>extremely</em> expensive to enterprise buyers because they’re massive and built for momentum over agility. Like a battleship, they can carry a lot of people very far but are a pain to turn. Enterprise companies value stability, and they want to commit upfront to a long-term partner.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this series, we’ll discuss strategies for building a product that will sell to the enterprise, and that will keep them happy for years. Following posts will break down strategies we’ve found helpful, and hopefully provide some ideas as you develop your own products.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Building a product that can sell to the enterprise is difficult but rewarding.</li>
  <li>Enterprise sales is like dating with intent to marry, with many of the same dynamics.</li>
  <li>Enterprise buyers’ decision-making is influenced by several important drivers: the complexity of enterprise businesses, complicated webs of stakeholders, and the need to plan on long time horizons.</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    Tracking position of something is a topic that I like, cause it makes me
    feel like to be a human with a sixth sense. With this sense I know where an
    object is and how it moves, in spite of&nbsp; I can't see the object
    directly with my naked eyes. Then how do we get a sixth sense? Because as
    ordinary human we only have five senses.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    In my opinion, living in this digital age today, we already had a sixth
    sense which is called technology that implemented in an application. Related
    with our topic in this post about flight tracking, there are numerous flight
    tracking applications out there such as flightradar24, FlightAware,
    flightview and so on, which enabled us to monitor position of airplanes
    around the earth. This post won't discuss about those applications, moreover
    I will discuss how to make our own flight tracking application with
    python.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously I already posted two tutorials about flight tracking with python.
    The first one is about
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2018/11/create-simple-live-flight-tracking-python.html">creating a simple flight tracking application with python</a>
    and the another one is
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2019/01/realtime-flight-tracking-pandas-bokeh-python.html">creating a flight tracking application with pandas and bokeh</a>. What is the difference with this one? The main difference is data source.
    In those two previous posts, I used
    <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ADS-B Exchange</a>
    and in this tutorial I'm using
    <a href="https://opensky-network.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Opensky Network</a>. Another difference is module version. In this tutorial I'm using the
    latest version python library in particular for plotting library. So there
    will be a slight change in the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enough for introduction. Now let's move to our main topic how to build a
    flight tracking application with python using open air traffic data. This
    tutorial consists of several sub-topics, there are: Getting data, importing
    required libraries, loading basemap, plotting aircraft's position and make a
    "realtime" flight tracking application. We will discuss each part, and at
    the end of this tutorial we will get a flight tracking application which is
    running in a browser as shown in figure 1.

<ins data-ad-client="ca-pub-5632482621101280" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-slot="7655392618"></ins>
</h3>
<p>
  As I mentioned earlier, in this tutorial we are using open air traffic data
  from OpenSky Network. OpenSky Network is an non-profit consortium that
  provides open air traffic data to the public in particular for research and
  non-commercial purposes. The data can be accessed through REST API, Python API
  and Java API. In this tutorial we will use REST API to retrieve the live air
  traffic data.
</p>
<p>
  To retrieve the data using REST API can be done using request operation. There
  are two types of requests can be used. The first one is request for specific
  airplane based on time in UNIX timestamp or ICAO24 address. The second one we
  can get all airplane data within an area extent using WGS84 coordinates
  system. Moreover the access for the data can be done anonymously or registered
  user. For anonymously request, it has 10 seconds resolution and 5 seconds for
  registered user. <br>
</p>
<p>
  In this tutorial we will use the second one. We will define an area extent
  with minimum and maximum coordinates, and then send the query to get all
  airplane data within the area. For example we want to fetch the data over United States
  with minimum coordinate -125.974,30.038 and maximum coordinate -68.748,52.214. The query for both anonymously and registered user will be as follow.
</p>
<pre><span>#</span>Anonymously Request
https:<span>//</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=-68.748</span><span></span>

<span>#</span>Registered User Request
https:<span>//</span>username:password<span>@</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=</span><span>30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=</span><span>-68.748</span><span></span></pre>
<p>
  Before continuing reading and to make sure the query is right, let's try it.
  Copy the anonymously query and paste into a browser. If you get a response
  like figure 2 below, then it works.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

</table>
<p>
  The return response as shown in figure 2 is in JSON structure with two keys.
  The first one is <i>time </i>and the second one is <i>States</i> that contains
  data for each airplane in a list array. The list array stores many data such
  as: ICAO24 address, airplane call sign, origin country, time position, last
  contact, longitude, latitude, barometer altitude and so on. For complete
  explanation about the data response and also further information about OpenSky
  Network API please refer to
  <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2020/08/OpenSky%20Network%20API" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenSky Network API Documentation</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Getting Air Traffic Data in Python</h3>

<p>
  We already retrieved the traffic data using REST API in a browser. Now let's
  do it in Python and process the response for the next purpose. For this
  tutorial I'm using Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 and some libraries such
  as Bokeh 2.1.1, Pandas 0.25.3, requests, json and numpy. <br>
</p>
<p>
  Below is the code to make a request and do a little processing on the
  data. At the beginning, we import the required libraries such as requests,
  json and Pandas. Then define the extent coordinate in WGS84 with respective
  variable <i>lon_min,lat_min, lon_max and lat_max</i>.&nbsp; Based on the
  extent coordinate, make the request query. If you are a registered user, give
  the user name and password in <i>user_name</i> and <i>password</i> variable at
  line 11-12. Based on given extent coordinate and user data, we create a
  request query in <i>url_data</i> variable as in line 13 and get the response
  in json format. The remain of the code is used to dump the response data into
  Pandas data frame and replace the blank/empty data with 'NaN' value with 'No
  Data'. The last line which is data frame's <i>head</i> method is used to view
  the first 5 top row of the data as shown in figure 3. &nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p>Make sure after executing the code, you have a result as in figure 3. If you
  get it, it means everything is fine, and we have the data that will be used
  for the next step.</p><h3>Plotting Airplane on the Map</h3>
<p>
  After getting the data, now let's plot the location of all airplanes on a
  map.&nbsp; For plotting purpose, we are using Bokeh library. Therefore we need
  to import the library first. Additionally we also need to import NumPy library
  that will be used in coordinate conversion.
</p>
<p>
  The conversion of coordinate system is implemented in a function which is
  called <i>wgs84_web_mercator</i>_. As it's name this function will be used to
  transform WGS84 coordinate into web Mercator coordinate system. This
  transformation is required because we are using a
  <i>STAMEN_TERRAIN</i> basemap in a web browser that has web Mercator
  projection (EPSG: 3857).
</p>
<p>
  After creating coordinate conversion function and perform the transformation
  for data frame and extent coordinates. Next we set up plotting figure settings
  by specifying plotting area extent based on the range of x and y coordinates.
  The aircraft will be plotted on the basemap based on x and y coordinates with
  Points and also with airplane icon image. Why both point and image are used to plot
  the aircraft? Image will give a better visualization by using an airplane
  image and it can be rotated with the respective track angle. But unfortunately it
  can't&nbsp; high light a selected object and display more information with
  hover tool. To overcome this issue we use both image and point in circle
  object to get nice a visualization and enable selection and hovering tool.
  &nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>
  The following is the code until this step. If it is
  executed we will get a result as in figure 4.&nbsp; <br>

<section>
    
    <small>Published on 28. August 2020</small>
    <p>You can find a lot of articles about how to prevent deadlocks in Go, but most of them focus on concurrency patterns and synchronization tools like mutexes. While it is important to know some techniques to prevent them, a trap you can stumble across more easily without noticing, are database transaction deadlocks.</p><p>A transaction deadlock can occur when you start one or more transactions and run queries outside of transactions while they are still active. If you run too many transactions and queries at the same time, you might run out of database connections in the connection pool. Here is a simple example of that:</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">// We will ignore errors for this example,
// you should always check them of course.

tx, _ := db.Begin()
tx.Exec(`INSERT INTO "foo" ("a", "b") VALUES (4, 2)`)

// ...

db.Query(`SELECT * FROM "foo" WHERE "a" = $1 AND "b" = $2`, 4, 2)

// DEADLOCK

tx.Commit()</code></pre><p>In this example, we create a new transaction and insert something to the database. Later on, we try to query the same result from the database. That the inserted row has not been committed yet, is not the actual issue, as you would receive no result in that case. The real issue here is that if you run this code concurrently, you might run out of connections. How many connections are opened to the database can be configured. As soon as your code reaches the <code>db.Query</code> the last connection might be occupied by the transaction and therefore blocks until a connection is available, which might never happen.</p><p>So how do you fix this? First of all, all queries should be run either outside or inside a transaction for a specific part of your code. Even if you run a transaction block and a non-transaction block concurrently, the non-transaction block will not be blocked by the transaction forever (but the non-transaction block might need to wait for the other part to finish). Additionally, you can use a linter or another tool to make sure all queries are run completely inside or outside of transactions.</p><p>I usually write integration tests against the database. If you do the same, you can configure the connection pool size to make sure the tests will only use a single connection. That way the tests will run into a deadlock should you have forgotten to use a transaction somewhere. You can easily configure that inside the <code>TestMain</code> function for a package.</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	db.SetMaxOpenConns(1) // db is the *sql.DB created somewhere
}</code></pre><p>I hope this helps you to prevent some nasty deadlock bugs. I found quite a few in a larger code base by limiting the connection pool. In production, you should use multiple connections to speed up things of course.</p>

<p>This is part 1 of a 4-part miniseries on issues with WebAssembly and proposals to fix them. <a href="http://troubles.md/why-do-we-need-the-relooper-algorithm-again/">Part 2 here</a>, <a href="http://troubles.md/the-stack-is-not-the-stack/">part 3 here</a>, <a href="http://troubles.md/microwasm/">part 4 here</a>.

This article assumes some familiarity with virtual machines, compilers and WebAssembly, but I’ll try to link to relevant information where necessary so even if you’re not you can follow along.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Also, this series is going to come off as if I dislike WebAssembly. I love WebAssembly! I wrote a <a href="http://troubles.md/why-wasm/">whole article about how great it is</a>! In fact, I love it so much that I want it to be the best that it can be, and this series is me working through my complaints with the design in the hope that some or all of these issues can be addressed soon, while the ink is still somewhat wet on the specification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure you’re all familiar with WebAssembly by now. It’s seeing use everywhere, from plugins to blockchain smart contracts to, of course, the web. If you go to the Wikipedia article for WebAssembly right now, you’ll get a great overview of the technology, except for one thing: the “Design” section states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly code is intended to be run on a portable abstract structured stack machine</p>

<p>Nope.</p>
<h2 id="stack-machines-vs-register-machines">Stack machines vs register machines</h2>
<p>The difference between a stack and a register machine is essentially this: a stack machine pops values from and pushed values onto a stack, so for example a <code>+</code> operation will pop the last two values off of the stack, add them together, and then push the result back onto the stack. A register machine has some number of places where values can be stored, and operations reads and writes to those registers. So <code>+</code> will take 3 arguments, 2 that represent the registers to read the operands from and 1 that represents the register to write the result to<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The problem with registers is that there is no liveness analysis. If you have some code like so:</p>
<pre><code>%0 = 1
%1 = 2
%2 = add %0, %1
...
</code></pre><p>Are <code>%0</code> and <code>%1</code> used after the addition? Without lookahead, you have no way of knowing. Even in SSA<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> register machines like LLVM IR (where each register is written to exactly once) the liveness of each register must be continuously recalculated. This means that you have overhead associated with compilation - knowing the liveness of variables is extremely important for generating efficient assembly, but instead of the liveness being calculated when creating the IR and stored as a part of it you have to recalculate this data every time.</p>
<p>If the IR is entirely in-memory this isn’t so bad, especially if your code is in SSA form, but it means that you have to do extra work for the same quality of code and it means that a streaming compiler (like FireFox’s Wasm baseline compiler) is unable to produce good code.</p>
<p>You can, of course, add liveness analysis metadata to the machine, but that liveness analysis is only useful if your code is in SSA form - if it’s not SSA form then the liveness is <em>extremely</em> coarse-grained.</p>
<p>Well, that’s where WebAssembly comes in. See, WebAssembly has these things called locals. Locals are mutable variables that live for the lifetime of a function. Since WebAssembly blocks can’t take arguments, they’re the only way for blocks to receive data from outside. This includes stuff like loop counters, the classic example for SSA-defeating mutable variables, but it also includes regular blocks. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>add</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>block</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
    <span>; Can't read the result of the add above</span>
  <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You have to do this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>local</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>local.set</span> <span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>add</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>2</span><span>)))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>block</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>local.get</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is a problem. Usually a stack machine can be trivially converted to SSA form with liveness analysis - an item on the stack is dead when it is used as the argument to an operator - no ifs, no buts. Even a <code>pick</code> operator<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> can be thought of in these terms as long as the argument to <code>pick</code> is a compile-time constant, although generally the SSA conversion of a stack machine that includes a <code>pick</code> instruction would be implemented using refcounting - meaning that reading a variable doesn’t involve creating an unnecessary new one. However, locals are a problem. They’re mutable, so you can’t trivially convert them to SSA, and they always live for the lifetime of the function.</p>
<p>This poses a problem for optimisation. SSA form is one of the most powerful optimisation tools. The fact that locals are mutable defeats that, and the fact that they’re global to the function defeats liveness analysis. For an example of why this is an issue, say you’re trying to compile WebAssembly into some native architecture. You’ll compile your code into one that uses some number of arguments in registers, but now unless you do your own liveness analysis on that function those registers are permanently marked “in use” by those arguments. Without extra analysis you don’t know when the last usage of that argument is, and so you can’t ever reuse the register used by that argument for something else. Even a function that never uses any of its arguments still can’t reuse the space used by those arguments for anything else.</p>
<p>This essentially makes WebAssembly a register machine without liveness analysis, but not only that, it’s a register machine that isn’t even in SSA form - both of the tools at our disposal to do optimisation are unavailable. In a true, optimising compiler we can recreate that information, but WebAssembly was already emitted by a compiler that generated that information once. There’s no technical reason why we should have to do that work again, it’s just a deficiency in the language. A compiler that has to act on a stream of WebAssembly has less ability to recreate this information and will end up generating significantly worse code for essentially no good reason.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>The developers of the WebAssembly spec aren’t dumb. For the most part it’s an extremely well-designed specification. However, they are weighed down by WebAssembly’s legacy. WebAssembly started out not as a bytecode, but more like a simplified binary representation for asm.js. Essentially it was originally designed to be source code, like JavaScript. It would be a more-efficient representation thereof but it still wasn’t a proper virtual machine instruction set. Then, it became a register machine<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and only at the last minute did it switch to stack-based encoding for the operators. At that point, concepts like locals were quite entrenched in the spec. Not only that, but for the most part the WebAssembly specification team were flying blind. No streaming compiler had yet been built, hell, no compiler had yet been built. It wasn’t clear that having locals would be problematic - after all, C gets by just fine using local variables that the compiler constructs the SSA graph for.</p>
<p>It’s only by working on a streaming WebAssembly compiler for integration with <a href="https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a> that I realised these issues, as well as more issues that I’ll get to in later articles in this series. Before then I considered WebAssembly’s design to be utterly rock-solid, and in fact I still strongly believe that most of the decisions made were the right ones. Although it has problems, it’s incredible how much the WebAssembly working group got right considering it was such relatively unknown territory at the time of the specification’s writing.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-alternative">What’s the alternative?</h2>
<p>So currently locals represent both function arguments and local variables. There is <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value/blob/master/proposals/multi-value/Overview.md">a proposal to allow blocks to have arguments and both functions and blocks to return more than one value</a>. With this, it becomes possible to get rid of locals entirely. Loop counters are implemented by having the counter be given as an argument, and then when you jump to the header of the loop you must have the new value of the counter on the stack. This acts like a phi function but is much conceptually simpler. Since it’s impossible to get the address of locals in WebAssembly there’s no need for <code>alloca</code> in any form - unlike in LLVM, you don’t need to have locals at all. The only thing left is to implement function arguments by having the function start with its arguments on the stack and you no longer need locals at all.</p>
<p>This massively reduces the complexity of the WebAssembly specification and compilers for it without reducing the expressivity, and allows the compilers generating the WebAssembly to encode more of their knowledge about the original source into the WebAssembly itself. Although optimising compilers will probably not generate better code from this, they will become much simpler and easier to maintain, and streaming compilers will become significantly simpler and produce significantly better code.</p>
<p>Finally, not only is a stack machine like this automatically in SSA form, but it’s automatically in <em>strict</em> SSA form. This means that it is statically impossible to access undefined variables. In WebAssembly as it exists now, you have to zero locals when entering a function unless you can statically prove that the local is always set before it is accessed. Again, the compilers almost always have this information, and removing locals makes accessing undefined memory statically impossible.</p>

            <p>Hopefully, everyone agrees that you should have some form of logging in your production systems. I would also hope that nowadays everyone agrees that using some kind of centralised logging system that you can access without SSHing onto production boxes is the right way to do things.</p>

<p>But what should we log?</p>

<p>Typically we log errors and exceptions, we want to see when things go wrong. With this logging in place when we see a 500 error on the server we simply go and check the logs to see what the problem is.</p>

<p>We can also monitor our logs and detect an increase in errors - this can alert us to problems before they have a large impact on users.</p>

<p>To me, this is the bare minimum of logging - errors and exceptions.</p>

<p>What we also need are logs that follow the happy path of the code, we should be able to see that the code is flowing in the way we expect it to.</p>

<p>Why do we need this? What do we do when a user reports a problem?</p>

<p>Go and check the logs to see if something is broken - no errors or exceptions - what do we do now?</p>

<p>We need to be able to follow the code through its path of execution and see where it deviates from what we expect:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The user says: “emails aren’t being sent”:</strong></p>

  <p>Check the logs, I can see the system was told to send an email, I can see it generated the template, I don’t see it sending the email - there’s something wrong in the code after template generation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an invaluable tool in our debugging arsenal saving us a huge amount of troubleshooting time.</p>

                    <p>I’ve played with my fair share of project management and issue tracker tools. Their claim to make our team more productive drew me in, only to leave me disappointed and frustrated.</p><p>I’ve written about <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/how-issue-tracking-hurts-development/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=product-development-problems">how issue tracking software hurts your product development </a>before.

While the reports may indicate that the team is shipping plenty of features / enhancements / bug fixes, it can never tell you is if those things moved the needle.</p><p>By introducing any form of metrics that focus on productivity, you influence the behaviour of the people contributing to them.</p><ul><li>Developers may cut corners to "<em>get it done</em>”.</li><li>Tests and code reviews may get skipped.</li><li>Instead of finding the root cause of the bug and fixing it, your team might just throw a series of <code>if</code> statements to fix it.</li></ul><p>Of course, before it’s deployed to production a product person will look at it. If they aren’t technically sound or don’t obsess over edge cases, a lot of the corner cuttings will get deployed to production.</p><p>This is snowballs into a series of poor experience for the customer and unnecessary bugs that could’ve been avoided.</p><hr><h3 id="problem-2-disconnected-view-of-what-needs-to-be-built">Problem 2: Disconnected view of what needs to be built</h3><p>Developers get only a fraction of the information they need to build good software.</p><p>They’re told “<em>Hey we need to build feature X. It will help our customers achieve Y. And we need to ship it within Z date.</em>”</p><p>Tickets are created and assigned with the assumption that it has enough detailed information that developers need to know. In reality, there are so many other things that get missed out when you think in tickets/issues.</p><p><strong>This is where the problem starts:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Key interactions are missed</strong> because the path to achieving a benefit from software is never linear. This is rarely communicated explicitly. <br></li><li><strong>Hidden capabilities are added</strong> to the feature because it was assumed to be "<em>cool</em>". Teams never communicate what a feature must not do. And this is more important than what it must do. </li><li><strong>Edge cases are never thought through or talked about</strong>. Sometimes, it’s the developers who bring it up. And that’s okay. Because some things are unearthed only during the creative exploration that a developer undergoes while they build it. However, most of the times, even the simplest of cases fall through the cracks.</li></ul><blockquote>Any developer who’s tried to build even a small chrome extension knows that building software includes ambiguities, uncertainties, intertwined relationships.</blockquote><hr><h3 id="problem-3-sequential-issue-driven-development">Problem 3: Sequential, issue-driven development</h3><p>Issue driven development leads to nothing but issue swamp. It gets messy very quickly as developers independently work on each issue sequentially. More code gets piled on as required and getting it to a production-ready state becomes a nightmare.</p><p>This also leads to a narrowed focus on the issue instead of the bigger goal of building a quality feature.</p><p><strong>Let me explain with an example.</strong></p><p>The customer requests for the ability to view a series of images in a grid view. An issue titled “<em>Get a series of images and display them in a grid</em>” is added. This is then broken down to actionable steps. A front-end and a back-end developer picks it up and together they build it out.</p><p><em>Side note: When your customers ask for a "feature", why do you call it an "issue"?</em></p><p>At a surface level, the feature might look completed. However, a series of issues come up that diminish the perceived quality of the feature:</p><ul><li>Some images look good, while many look pixelated.</li><li>Images don’t have captions. Nor do I have the ability to add a caption to the entire grid.</li><li>The page takes ages to load because of the images.</li><li>How many images should you load at a time?</li><li>Should the images be interactive?</li></ul><p>As you can see, what looks like a simple ticket has a bucket load of questions that need to be answered and functionalities that need to be built.</p><blockquote>The problem with issue driven development is, it quickly shifts the mentality from “Let’s solve this problem” to “What next?”</blockquote><p>As a result of “<em>What next?</em>” mentality, a simple sorting of an object will get implemented using the easiest method. While it might not be the wrong method, it’ll make it exponentially harder for others to debug or understand the code. Cross-pollination or exchange of ideas about the problem rarely occurs. And makes it impossible for teams to communicate the essential details required to build the product.</p><p><strong>These product development problems come from a deep need to satisfy a metric or to show productivity. They pigeon-hole developers to ticket-movers and do not enable them to think at a system level.</strong> </p><p>It ties back to the previous point I made on how teams begin to visualize false-positives.</p><hr><h2 id="so-how-can-you-fix-these-product-development-problems">So, how can you fix these product development problems?</h2><h3 id="understand-the-difference-between-issue-tracking-vs-product-development">Understand the difference between issue tracking vs product development</h3><p>The road to shipping anything that isn’t a bug is filled with speed bumps and diversions. Product development is never as simple as <em>“do X, Y, and Z, and voila!</em>”</p><p>A feature, unlike a bug, goes through a series of exploration. Many functionalities are an implicit necessity. This implicit requirement can never be communicated in a single ticket.</p><p>While a bug, on the other hand, is a lot easier to communicate. All you need are three things:</p><ol><li>Steps to reproduce,</li><li>What you expected to see, and</li><li>What you saw instead.</li></ol><p>Even for something like a bug, that requires only three specific details, the developer will still have to go through an exploration phase to identify the root cause.</p><p>If a bug, that has all the details specified accurately, has to go through an exploration phase, imagine how much more complex it is to build a feature that has an arbitrarily broad spectrum of scale and detail.</p><blockquote>It’s those chock full of implicit requirements that get missed out in a ticket that makes a developer mad and frustrated.</blockquote><p>The next time you ask your developers to build a feature, don’t try to squeeze it all in a two-line ticket. It never works. Instead, spec each interaction and functionality of your feature into separate user stories. That way, you can zoom-in to track each work item and zoom-out to track an entire feature.</p><p><em>Pssst...

But even the slightest of hints reduces your team’s functional standards to “<em>It runs, let’s deploy.</em>” The quality of the code (and sometimes even the feature’s standards) becomes an afterthought. What you’ll get is a hodgepodge of enough code to get a working product that will eventually fall apart.</p><p>When teams negotiate on what can be built within a timeframe, it pushes the product person to think deeper about what’s <em>really</em> needed.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  



  <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3a8e939667e3734b84dff063fff3965fe824553c/d7922/uploads/good-names.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In <a href="https://toolbox.humandeluxe.com/2020/08/07/how-to-name">this video</a>, I walked you through our naming process. We usually work in a workshop format to create a long list of potential brand names for our clients. This can be done either remote or onsite. If you’ve missed this it the last time, make sure you watch the video first:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8Hlbp8mp_I?color=white&amp;theme=light"></iframe>

<p>Once we have the long list of names, how do we make the selection? How do we distinguish between good and bad brand names?</p>

<p>The process is twofold: On the one side, we need too identify good brand names, on the other side we need to exclude all the bad names. So let’s look at the first part: How do you create a good brand name?</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-brand-name">What makes a good brand name?</h2>

<p>At Human Deluxe, we follow the teachings of Alexandra Watkins, who created the SMILE &amp; SCRATCH principles: Good names make you smile, bad names leave you scratch your head. Of course, these are Acronyms, so let’s look at how to make yourself SMILE with a good name:</p>

<p>The qualities of a good name:</p>

<p><strong>Suggestive</strong>: A good name will give you a hint of a positive brand experience. It will suggest the rest of the brand for you. Great examples of this are travel company KAYAK or streaming service Pandora: Once you open the streaming box, it would not stop playing – clever, right?</p>

<p><strong>Meaningful</strong> A good name resonates with your target audience. Not only do they feel good, but they already know what to expect. Obvious examples of this are domain provider Namecheap, diet drink Slimfast or even good old Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>Imagery</strong> A great name is visually evocative. It creates a picture in your head that people will instantly associate with your brand. Even if a name is abstract, it will be able to give your audience a certain association and idea of what it could look like. Think of brands like: Caterpilar or Citibank – these are great examples.</p>

<p><strong>Legs</strong> Like a good hiker, a great name has strong legs. It lends itself to a theme for extra mileage: A name with great legs can shine through to the whole brand, directing the tonality and vocabulary. Personally, I like how twitter worked that in: A single microblogpost is a Tweet, the logo is a bird, even certain icons would be bird-themed, like the birdhouse Home button or the egg avatar.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional</strong> A good brand name moves people. does not only work in their mind, it touches their heart. This works for both B2C and B2B companies. Business brands don’t have to be boring. In fact, they can swing up to greater heights if they have an emotional impact, distinguishing themselves from their dull competition. Brands that are brave enough to be emotional do connect with humans like no other. Take Yahoo! or Greenpeace for example – it works.</p>

<p>If you want to figure out if your brand is good, your name for these criterias. At best, a good name ticks all of them. At least, your name should check one or two criterias. At any cost, avoid head scratchers names. In our next article, we will explain what these are and how you identify them.

<p>One of the major challenges of writing a journal article is to keep track of versions - both the different versions you create as the document progresses, and to merge in the changes made by your collaborators. For most academics Microsoft Word is the default writing tool, and it is both very good and very bad in this. Very good because the <em>track changes</em> feature makes it easy to see what has changed since the last version and who made the changes. Very bad because this feature is built around keeping everything in a single Word document, so that only one person can work on on a manuscript at a time. This usually means sending manuscripts around by email, and being very careful about not confusing different versions of the document, which requires <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531">creativity</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Approaches to overcome these challenges are to a) integrate the Word documents into collaboration tools such as Sharepoint and Office 365, or document sharing services such as Dropbox and Google Docs (if you use it just for that), or b) use a different authoring tool altogether. If neither of these approaches works for you, you have a third option: use the version control system <strong>git</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mulvany.net/presentations/WikimaniaOpenScholarshipTalk.slides.html#/3">Git</a> is software that helps with <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/25/using-microsoft-word-with-git/(http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)">tracking changes to files</a> so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is typically used to track changes of software source code (and was originally developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005), but in fact git can be used for any file where we need to keep track of versions over time. Git is open source software that runs locally on your computer, so please go ahead and start tracking changes to your manuscripts (or other complex documents) with git. Any time you want to store a version, do a <code>git commit</code> with a little description and an optional tag.</p>
<p>This approach is not ideal, as git was written with source code in text format in mind and for example doesn’t understand what has changed between two revisions of a Word document. Some people will tell you to never store binary files in a version control system, but don’t listen to them. Instead give git a tool to convert Word documents into plain text, and git will then happily tell you what has changed between revisions. Several tools can do this, but since earlier this month Pandoc can read Word documents in <code>docx</code> format. Do the following to have Pandoc convert Word documents into markdown, and to compare the revisions by word and not by line (which makes more sense):</p>
<pre><code># .gitattributes file in root folder of your git project
*.docx diff=pandoc</code></pre>
<pre><code># .gitconfig file in your home folder
[diff "pandoc"]
  textconv=pandoc --to=markdown
  prompt = false
[alias]
  wdiff = diff --word-diff=color --unified=1</code></pre>
<p>You can then use <code>git wdiff important_file.docx</code> to see the changes (with deletions in red and insertions in green), or <code>git log -p --word-diff=color important_file.docx</code> to see all changes over time.</p>
<p>While you can now track revisions of a Word document and see the changes, you also want to be able to merge different versions of a Word document together so that you and your collaborators can work on the manuscript in parallel. Git can’t merge binary files together, so you need to first convert the Word document into a format that git understands. Just as in the previous example we can use Pandoc for that, with markdown as the textual format. This would also work with HTML or LaTeX, but the simplicity of markdown makes it better suited for version control which doesn’t know about the markup of these formats.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that git became so popular with software developers is that it is a <strong>distributed version control system</strong> instead of a centralized system such as Subversion. This means that you can track all revisions locally on your computer, but can still synchronize your revisions with another user. <strong>Github</strong> is a popular service that facilitates this synchronization and adds some nice features on top. One way to collaborate with your co-authors is therefore to set up a Github repository (public or private) for your manuscript, and store the master version of the manuscript in markdown format. Instead of working on the master version directly, you would use Pandoc to convert back and forth between this master version in markdown format and your Word document, and would continue to use Word as authoring tool. <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/18/introducing-rakali/">Rakali</a> is a Pandoc tool that I released last week that can help automate this document conversion. Github has a a number of features to facilitate collaboration that can be used here, e.g.&nbsp;Github issues for discussion and task management.</p>
<p>There are still a few rough edges in the workflow described above (e.g.&nbsp;only partial support of Word track changes), but it is an interesting approach to collaborate using Microsoft Word and git. And this workflow can of course be enhanced to also include authors that write in LaTeX or one of the other formats that Pandoc supports. One nice side effect of using markdown is that Github will automatically render a webpage for the document (which it will not do for HTML without extra effort).</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we are thrilled to announce the public release of <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt"><code>defmt</code></a> ("de format").
<code>defmt</code> stands for "deferred formatting" and it's a highly efficient logging framework.
As we covered in <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/21st-century-embedded-tooling/">our blog post about embedded tooling for the 21st century</a> we hope <code>defmt</code> will serve as the base for features like data visualization and interactive logging front-ends.
In this post we'll cover how to use <code>defmt</code> with <code>probe-rs</code> supported devices and what you can do with <code>defmt</code> today.</p>



<p>We have created a <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template">Cargo project template</a> to make the setup easier.
Here are the setup steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <strong>git</strong> version of <code>probe-run</code>, <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/probe-run/">a custom Cargo runner that lets you run embedded apps if they were native apps</a>. Be sure to enable the <code>defmt</code> Cargo feature!</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo install <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--features</span> defmt
</code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Either initialize the project template with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate"><code>cargo-generate</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template/archive/master.zip">fetch a copy</a> and initialize the <code>Cargo.toml</code> manually.</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo generate <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--name</span> my-app
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are not using <code>cargo-generate</code> you'll need to manually enter the <code>author</code> and <code>name</code> fields in <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [package]
<span>-# authors = ["{{authors}}"]
-# name = "{{project-name}}"
</span><span>+name = "my-app"
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After that there are a few TODOs in the template.
You can <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> for the word TODO (<code>rg TODO .cargo .</code>) to find them but we'll walk you through all of them in this blog post.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pick a chip from <code>probe-run --list-chips</code> and enter it into <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If, for example, you have a nRF52840 Development Kit from one of <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020">our workshops</a> then replace <code>{{chip}}</code> with <code>nRF52840_xxAA</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
<span>-runner = "probe-run --chip {{chip}} --defmt"
</span><span>+runner = "probe-run --chip nRF52840_xxAA --defmt"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Adjust the compilation target in <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 chip you'll want to use the <code>thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code> target.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [build]
<span>-target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+
-# target = "thumbv7m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M3
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabi"   # Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 (no FPU)
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F and Cortex-M7F (with FPU)
</span><span>+target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F (with FPU)
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Add a HAL as a dependency.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 you'll want to use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nrf52840-hal"><code>nrf52840-hal</code></a>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [dependencies]
<span>-# some-hal = "1.2.3"
</span><span>+nrf52840-hal = "0.11.0"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Now that you have selected a HAL fix the HAL import in <code>src/lib.rs</code></li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code> // my-app/src/lib.rs
<span>-// use some_hal as _; // memory layout
</span><span>+use nrf52840_hal as _; // memory layout
</span></code></pre></div>


<p>You are now all set to <code>cargo-run</code> your first <code>defmt</code>-powered application!
There are some examples in the <code>src/bin</code> directory.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/hello.rs</span>

<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_main</span><span>]</span>
<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_std</span><span>]</span>

<span>use</span> <span>my_app</span> <span>as</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span> <span>// global logger + panicking-behavior + memory layout</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>cargo run</code>-ning this program produces the classic "Hello, world!" output.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rb` is an alias for `run --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rb hello
<span>    Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
flashing program ..
DONE
resetting device
0.000000 INFO Hello, world!
(..)

</span><span>$</span> <span>echo</span> <span>$?</span>
<span>0
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or if you are using VS code + Rust-Analyzer, instead, you can open the <code>src/bin/hello.rs</code> file and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/run-rust-on-your-embedded-device-from-vscode/">click the "Run" button as we demonstrated in a previous blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Now let's take a closer look at the features of the framework.
This post will be a quick overview.
For more details check out <a href="https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/">the <code>defmt</code> book</a>.</p>



<p>We have wired the <code>panic_handler</code> to <code>defmt</code> to make panicking much cheaper.
Consider this example, which is part of the project template:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/panic.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>panic!</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It produces this output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb panic
<span>0.000000 INFO main
0.000001 ERROR panicked at src/bin/panic.rs:11:5
stack backtrace:
   0: 0x00000554 - __bkpt

   7: 0x00000238 - ResetTrampoline
   8: 0x00000214 - Reset
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you may have seen from our previous posts with <code>probe-run</code> you get a stack backtrace for free!</p>

<h2 id="binary-size">Binary size</h2>

<p>What I wanted to highlight here is the binary size.
Here's the output of <code>cargo-size</code> (part of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binutils"><code>cargo-binutils</code></a> project).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo size <span>--bin</span> panic <span>--</span> <span>-A</span>
<span>section              size        addr

.rodata               360       0x600
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>An here's the output of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-bloat"><code>cargo-bloat</code></a></p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo bloat <span>-n</span> 5 <span>--bin</span> panic

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are <strong>no</strong> <code>core::fmt</code> function calls there and that's what makes the binary so small.</p>

<h2 id="vs-rprintln">vs <code>rprintln!</code></h2>

<p>Let's compare against a program that uses <a href="https://docs.rs/rtt-target/0.2.0/rtt_target/macro.rprintln.html"><code>rtt_target::rprintln</code></a>, which is hard-wired to <code>core::fmt</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#</span><span>[</span><span>cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry</span><span>]</span>

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The biggest functions are <code>core::fmt</code> related.
The <code>defmt</code>-powered <code>panic</code> uses 1.59 KB of Flash (<code>.text</code> + <code>.rodata</code>); <code>panic-rprintln</code> uses 13.85 KB.
That's almost a whopping 9x savings.

<p><em>programs compiled with <code>-Oz</code> and <code>lto=fat</code></em></p>

<p>Now you can panic without reservation: panic messages are no longer binary-size expensive.
Also, no more need to reach out for crates that discard panic information, like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/panic-halt"><code>panic-halt</code></a>, to keep the binary size low.</p>



<p>If you have used the <code>log</code> crate before you know that it supports 5 logging levels: trace, debug, info, warn and error – sorted from lowest severity to highest.
<code>defmt</code> supports the same five levels through 5 logging macros: <code>trace!</code>, <code>debug!</code>, <code>info!</code>, <code>warn!</code> and <code>error!</code>.
Let's see them in action:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/levels.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"info"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>trace!</span><span>(</span><span>"trace"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>warn!</span><span>(</span><span>"warn"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>debug!</span><span>(</span><span>"debug"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>error!</span><span>(</span><span>"error"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 TRACE trace
0.000002 WARN warn
0.000003 DEBUG debug
0.000004 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not shown above but the logging level (e.g. INFO) gets nicely colored in the terminal output.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>The main reason for having logging levels is to be able to filter some of them out.
If we re-run the <code>levels</code> example but compile it using the <code>release</code> profile we get less output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rrb` is an alias for `run --release --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rrb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 WARN warn
0.000002 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is because the project template has been configured to report all logging levels when the <code>dev</code> profile is used, but only INFO and higher severity logs when the <code>release</code> profile is used.</p>

<p><code>defmt</code> defaults to logging nothing (filtering everything out) but this behavior can be configured via Cargo features.</p>

<p>If you look at the project template's <code>Cargo.toml</code> you'll see that the <code>defmt-default</code> feature is enabled for the top crate (<code>my-app</code>):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[features]</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"defmt-default"</span><span>,</span>
<span># "dependency-a/defmt-trace",</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>defmt-default</code> behavior logs at TRACE level and higher severity if profile is <code>dev</code> and log INFO and up if profile is <code>release</code>.
The other features like <code>defmt-warning</code> enable logging at the specified level (WARN) and up regardless of the compilation profile (<code>dev</code> or <code>release</code>).</p>

<p>Logging filters can be configured per crate using Cargo features.
If you have used the <a href="https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.7.1/env_logger/"><code>env_logger</code></a> crate you may have used the <code>RUST_LOG</code> environment variable to enable logging in dependencies.
With <code>env_logger</code> you use <code>RUST_LOG=dep-a=debug,dep-b=info</code> to enable DEBUG logging in <code>dep-a</code> and INFO logging in <code>dep-b</code>.
With <code>defmt</code> that configuration is done in the top crate's <code>Cargo.toml</code> as shown below:</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [features]
 default = [
   "defmt-default",
<span>-# "dependency-a/defmt-trace",
</span><span>+  "dep-a/defmt-debug",
+  "dep-b/defmt-info",
</span> ]
</code></pre></div>


<p>So far we have only logged string literals in our examples but <code>defmt</code> also supports formatting arguments.
<code>core::write!</code> supports a variety of formatting parameters, each one associated to a formatting trait: <code>{:?}</code> (<code>Debug</code>), <code>{}</code> (<code>Display</code>), <code>{:x}</code> (<code>Hex</code>).
<code>defmt</code> has a single formatting trait: <code>Format</code>, which is associated to the <code>{:?}</code> formatting parameter.</p>

<p><code>{:?}</code> expects a type that implements the <code>Format</code> trait.
<code>Format</code> is implemented for primitives like integers and slices.
To implement <code>Format</code> for user-defined types (structs or enums) use the <code>#[derive(Format)]</code> attribute.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>{:?}</code>, there are formatting parameters for some primitives: e.g. <code>{:u8}</code>, <code>{:bool}</code>.
Prefer these parameters for primitives as they compress the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>The Best Open Social Apps in 2021</h2><p>Open source software has become a big cultural phenomenon in recent years. Because its free in every sense of the word, its especially good for companies and groups that want to self host their software due to concerns over privacy and control. Other times open source solutions are chosen by those who simply want to have the freedom to use a consistent set of tools that are not tied to a single vendor. The only problem is that there is <i>so much of it</i>. It is hard to sort through it all. So to save you the trouble, we are sharing our picks about what we consider to be the best of the best open social software out there. Enjoy!</p><p>By the way we might have jumped the gun a bit with the title but 2021 is almost here. We're pretty sure these apps will stand the test of time. We use these apps ourselves every day, we have deployed them on behalf of our clients and we are confident they will remain highly competitive options throughout 2021, and if that changes we'll update this article. Good Luck!</p><p>If these apps aren't your cup of tea, we have good news. There are hundreds of other free social apps that you can search for on github.com. Content management systems, workflow tools, collaborative document editing, microblogging software and more. Have we missed anything important? Do you have any feedback or questions?</p> <p><a href="mailto:hi@opensocial.com">Let us know!</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>The IAM policy is the cornerstone of security of an AWS account. There is an oft-repeated notion of the shared responsibility model that stipulates that certain parts of security is the responsibility of the cloud provider, such as preventing malicious parties physical access to the infrastructure. On the other hand, the cloud provider gives you security controls and it is your responsibility to use them properly.</p> <p>The main security control is IAM and it is used everywhere inside AWS. With IAM you are not only able to create users for people who need access to the account but also to define what each user has access to.</p> <p>There are several types of policies, but the two most important ones are the identity-, and the resource-based policies. Whatever you do in your AWS account you’ll need to use these.</p> <h2 id="identity-based-policies">Identity-based policies</h2> <p>Identity-based policies are the easier of the two, as some variation of it is present in most systems. They <strong>define what an identity can do</strong>, such as a user has access to an S3 bucket.</p> <p>There are two types of identities in AWS: <strong>users and roles</strong>. By attaching a policy to an identity you can give it permissions to access resources. For example, you can attach this policy to allow a user to read an object in an S3 bucket:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span>
	</span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
		</span><span>{</span><span>
			</span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
				</span><span>"s3:GetObject"</span><span>
			</span><span>],</span><span>
			</span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span>
			</span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::&lt;bucket&gt;/text.txt"</span><span>
		</span><span>}</span><span>
	</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Since the policy is attached to an identity, a user in this case, there is no Principal element in the policy. On the other hand, the Resource defines the object in the bucket that the user can access.</p> <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="" style="width:384px;height:265px" viewBox="0 0 384 265"><defs><filter height="300%" id="prefix__a" width="300%" x="-1" y="-1"><feGaussianBlur result="blurOut" stdDeviation="2"></feGaussianBlur><feColorMatrix in="blurOut" result="blurOut2" values="0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .4 0"></feColorMatrix><feOffset dx="4" dy="4" in="blurOut2" result="blurOut3"></feOffset><feBlend in="SourceGraphic" in2="blurOut3"></feBlend></filter></defs><ellipse cx="141" cy="18" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" rx="8" ry="8" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></ellipse><path d="M141 26v27m-13-19h26m-13 19l-13 15m13-15l13 15" fill="none" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="31" x="125.5" y="87.995">user</text><path d="M241 37c0-10 34-10 34-10s34 0 34 10v25.297c0 10-34 10-34 10s-34 0-34-10V37" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M241 37c0 10 34 10 34 10s34 0 34-10" fill="none" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="251" y="63.995">bucket</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M51 152L51 228.891 231 228.891 231 162 221 152 51 152z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M221 152v10h10" fill="#FEFECE" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="39" x="61" y="174.995">policy</text><path d="M52 178.297L230 178.297M52 180.297L230 180.297" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="144" x="67" y="195.292">Action: s3:GetObject</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="148" x="67" y="211.589">Resource: &lt;bucket&gt;</text><path d="M141 91.08v60.88" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path d="M156.63 49.5h78.95" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M240.76 49.5L231.76 45.5 235.76 49.5 231.76 53.5 240.76 49.5z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="174.75" y="42.567">Allowed</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="372" y="251.995">A policy attached to the user gives access to a bucket</text></svg> </p> <p>Note that groups are not identities but a way to attach policies to multiple users.</p> <h3 id="users">Users</h3> <p>There is only one type of user that can be created, but depending on how they are used we can distinguish <em>natural</em> and <em>technical</em> users.</p> <p>Natural users are created for people.

To give access to your account, you can use a role that can be used by identities in another account. This way you don’t need to create users and transfer secrets (passwords or access keys) to grant cross-account access. Another use-case is users logging in via SAML or Cognito. Instead of creating a user for every single person who can log in, you define a role and all users assume it. Then you can give permissions to the role and all users signed in this way will gain those permissions.</p> <p>Also, AWS services use roles to gain permissions to access your account. For example, CloudTrail can put logs into a CloudWatch Log group, but it needs permission to do so. On the Trail config, you need to specify a role:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role-72cf0208de53148da9ebb597ccf983890b3c5c8ba59222865e849f81918718c9.png" integrity="sha256-cs8CCN5TFI2p67WXzPmDiQs8XIulkiKGXoSfgZGHGMk=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This role allows the CloudTrail service to assume it:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role_trust-88790c9eb727ab035fd2e4d564b15ca8bb07951376ea75da8e0918ce8d92983f.png" integrity="sha256-iHkMnrcnqwNf0uTVZLFcqLsHlRN26nXajgkYzo2SmD8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>And the role has the policies to access CloudWatch Logs:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_permissions-e536a8a0d9a50b84c797d688f891bdc7440c1a6c010d919b7e6bc9854dee03bd.png" integrity="sha256-5TaooNmlC4THl9aI+JG9x0QMGmwBDZGbfmvJhU3uA70=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This way you have full control over what a given service can do. And this pattern appears in many places. A Lambda function uses a role in a similar way, the S3 bucket replication gains permissions to write a bucket using a role, and AWS Organizations creates a role in the member account so that you can initialize the resources inside it.</p> <h2 id="resource-based-policies">Resource-based policies</h2> <p>What if there is no identity to attach the policies to? This is the case for anonymous access, and also when an AWS service does not use a service role, such as an API Gateway. When there is no identity, identity-based policies can not be used.</p> <p>Many, but not all, AWS services <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">support resource-based policies</a>.

</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>Action</code> in resource-based policies can be one that is relevant to the service. A bucket policy can allow <code>s3:GetObject</code>, a role the <code>sts:AssumeRole</code>, while a Lambda the <code>lambda:InvokeFunction</code>.</p> <p>And the <code>Resource,</code> when needed, can only start with the resource’s own ARN. This makes sense as one resource can only give access to itself or things below it but not to unrelated resources.</p> <p>How the resource defines who gets access and how specific this control is depends on the service. The <code>Principal</code> element is always present and that can define users, roles, services, other accounts, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html">a few other things</a>.</p> <p>But, especially with services, this is not granular enough. For example, when a role’s trust policy defines the Lambda service, it does not specify <em>which</em> Lambda function to trust. Similarly, the role for the CloudTrail allows the <code>cloudtrail.amazonaws.com</code> service, but there is no further restrictions on <em>which trail</em>.</p> <p>Some resource policies support conditions to allow only a given resource. For example, the policy for a Lambda function is able to selectively allow the API which can call it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"ArnLike"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Unfortunately, there is no generic way to know which resource-based policies support further restrictions on the caller using conditions. You need to check the AWS-provided policy examples to see what conditions are possible.</p> <h2 id="using-together">Using together</h2> <p>When both types of policies are effective then you can use both to give and restrict access. When an IAM user wants to get an object from an S3 bucket then both the policy attached to the user and the one defined on the bucket are effective.</p> <h3 id="allowing-access">Allowing access</h3> <p>With most services if <em>either</em> of the policies give access to an action then it will be granted. The notable exceptions are KMS key policies and cross-account role trust policies where <em>both</em> the resource and the identity needs an explicit Allow.</p> <p>As resource-based policies can grant access to identities, the notion that a user can not do anything without attaching policies to it is not true. For example, a bucket policy can allow a user to get objects and that is effective even if the user has no permissions on its own:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

      <p>This blog post explains the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> and the corresponding new PyTorch <a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="main-contributions">Main contributions</h2>
<p>We introduce a new energy function and a corresponding new update rule which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the energy function.</p>

<p>The new energy function is a generalization (discrete states \(\Rightarrow\) continuous states) of <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> aka <strong>Dense Associative Memories</strong> introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01929">Demircigil et al.</a>
The new modern Hopfield Network with continuous states keeps the characteristics of its discrete counterparts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exponential storage capacity</li>
  <li>extremely fast convergence</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprisingly, the new update rule is the attention mechanism of transformer networks introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>.
We use these new insights to analyze transformer models in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-blog-post-is-about">What this blog post is about</h2>

<p>This blog post is split into three parts. First, we make the transition from traditional Hopfield Networks towards <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> and their generalization to continuous states through our <strong>new energy function</strong>. Second, the properties of our new energy function and the connection to the self-attention mechanism of transformer networks is shown. Finally, we introduce and explain a new PyTorch layer (<a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>), which is built on the insights of our work. We show several practical use cases, i.e. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13505">Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire Classification</a>, Hopfield pooling, and associations of two sets.</p>

<h2 id="from-classical-hopfield-networks-to-self-attention">From classical Hopfield Networks to self-attention</h2>

<p><strong>Associative memories</strong> are one of the earliest artificial neural models dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Best known are <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">Hopfield Networks</a>, presented by John Hopfield in 1982.
As the name suggests, the main purpose of associative memory networks is to associate an input with its most similar pattern. In other words, the purpose is to store and retrieve patterns.
We start with a review of classical Hopfield Networks.</p>

<h3 id="hopfield-networks">Hopfield Networks</h3>

<p>The simplest associative memory is just a <strong>sum of outer products</strong> of the \(N\) patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) that we want to store (Hebbian learning rule). In classical Hopfield Networks these patterns are polar (binary), i.e. \(\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1 \}^d\), where \(d\) is the length of the patterns. The corresponding weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_i^N \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ . \tag{1}
\end{equation}\]

<p>The weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) stores the patterns, which can be retrieved starting with a <strong>state pattern</strong> \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Nomenclature</strong></p>

<p>From now on we denote the \(N\) <strong>stored patterns</strong> as \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) and any <strong>state pattern</strong> or <strong>state</strong> as \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>

<p>The basic <strong>synchronuous update rule</strong> is to repeatedly multiply the state pattern \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\), subtract the bias and take the sign:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} =  \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\xi}^t - \boldsymbol{b}) \ , \tag{2}
\label{eq:restorage}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is a bias vector, which can be interpreted as threshold for every component.
The <strong>asynchronous update rule</strong> performs this update only for one component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) and then selects the next component for update.
Convergence is reached if \(\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} = \boldsymbol{\xi^{t}}\).</p>

<p>The asynchronous version of the update rule of Eq. \eqref{eq:restorage} minimizes the <strong>energy function</strong> \(\text{E}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\text{E} = -\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\xi}^T \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^T\boldsymbol{b} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^d\sum_{j=1}^d w_{ij}\xi_i\xi_j + \sum_{i=1}^d b_i\xi_i \ . \tag{3}
\label{eq:energy_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>As derived in the papers of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=58341">Bruck</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X85900290">Goles-Chacc et al.</a> and <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">the original Hopfield paper</a>, the convergence properties are dependent on the structure of the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) and the method by which the nodes are updated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For asynchronous updates with \(w_{ii} \geq 0\) and \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state.</li>
  <li>For synchronous updates with \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state or a limit cycle of length 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the asynchronous update rule and symmetric weights, \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) \leq \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) holds. When \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) = \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) for the update of every component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^t\), a local minimum in \(\text{E}\) is reached.
All stored patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) should be fixed points of the Hopfield Network, i.e.</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x}_i = \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{b}) \ . \tag{4}
\end{equation}\]

<p>They should even be local minima of \(\text{E}\).</p>

<p>In the following example, no bias vector is used. This means that taking the inverse image, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</p>

<p>We start with an <strong>illustrative example</strong> of a Hopfield Network. <strong>One input image</strong> should first be stored and then be retrieved.
The input image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://brandstetter-johannes.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_original.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>Since an associative memory has <strong>polar states and patterns</strong> (or binary states and patterns), we convert the input image to a black and white image:</p>

<p><img src="https://brandstetter-johannes.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>The <strong>weight matrix</strong> \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is the outer product of this black and white image \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ , \tag{5}
\label{eq:weight_matrix}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where for this example \(d = 64 \times 64\).</p>

<p>Can the original image be restored if half of the pixels are masked out? The masked image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://brandstetter-johannes.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>which is our inital state \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\). This inital state is updated via multiplication with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\).
It takes one update until the original image is restored.</p>

<p><img src="https://brandstetter-johannes.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked_retrieved.png" alt="not found" width="600px"></p>

<p>What happens if we store <strong>more than one pattern</strong>? The weight matrix is then built from the sum of outer products of <strong>three stored patterns</strong> (three input images):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ . \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]

<p><img src="https://brandstetter-johannes.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_6.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p><img src="https://brandstetter-johannes.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_12.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>In this figure, the left hand side shows the three stored patterns, and the right hand side shows masked state patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) together with the retrieved patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{\text{new}}\).</p>

<p>Looking at the upper row of images might suggest that the retrieval process is no longer perfect. But there are two interesting facts to take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Masking the original images introduces many pixel values of \(-1\). We therefore have the odd behavior that the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Bart}}\rangle\) is larger than the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\rangle\).</li>
  <li>As stated above, if no bias vector is used, the inverse of the pattern, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the retrieval of the upper image looks incorrect, it is de facto correct. However, for the lower row example, the retrieval is no longer correct.
The weights of \(2 \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Marge}}\) have simply overwritten the weights of \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\).
For both examples, only the retrieval after the first update step is shown, but the results do not change when performing further update steps.
The next figure shows the Hopfield Network retrieval for 6 patterns.</p>

<p>Clearly, retrieving the patterns is imperfect. One might suspect that the limited storage capacities of Hopfield Networks, see <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.3548&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Amit et al.</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.061910">Torres et al</a>, is the problem.
However, we show now that the storage capacity is not directly responsible for the imperfect retrieval.
The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns free of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong \frac{d}{2\log(d)} \ , \tag{7}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(d\) is the dimension of the input.</p>

<p>The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong 0.14 d\ . \tag{8}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield2}
\end{equation}\]

<p>In the example, the storage capacity is \(C \cong 0.14 d = 0.14 \cdot 64 \cdot 64 \sim 570\).
Thus, insufficient storage capacity is not directly responsible for the retrieval errors.
Instead, the example patterns are correlated, therefore the retrieval has errors.</p>

<p>Consequently, we need a model which <strong>allows pulling apart close patterns</strong>, such that (strongly) <strong>correlated patterns can be distinguished</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>On storage capacity</strong></p>

<p>The storage capacities stated in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield} and in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield2} are derived for \(w_{ii}=0\).
Recently, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> analyzed the storage capacity for Hopfield Networks with \(w_{ii}\geq 0\). Also for \(w_{ii}\geq 0\), a storage capacity of \(C \cong 0.14 d\)
for retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors was observed. The ratio \(C/d\) is often called <strong>load parameter</strong> and denoted by \(\alpha\). <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> showed that there is a second regime with very large \(\alpha\), where the storage capacity is much higher, i.e. more fixed points exist. However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07741">Rocci et al.</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/8/726/htm">Gosti et al.</a> reported that these fixed points for very large \(\alpha\) are unstable and do not have an attraction basin.</p>

<p>The storage capacity is a crucial characteristic of Hopfield Networks. <strong>Modern Hopfield Networks</strong> (aka Dense Associative Memories) introduce a new energy function instead of the energy in Eq. \eqref{eq:energy_hopfield} to create a higher storage capacity. <strong>Discrete</strong> modern Hopfield Networks have been introduced first by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> …</p></div></div>

<p>During some redteam engagements, we find ourselves in the need of writing DLL’s. However, debugging DLL’s is not as easy as it seems, as a DLL isn’t built to run on its own.<br>In this article, we will explore how you can debug a DLL effectively.</p>



<h3>What is a DLL?</h3>



<p>A DLL is short for a dynamically linked library. It’s a modular approach of writing code. DLL’s are  written in C or C++ and, under normal circumstances, serve as a library which programs can access to execute functions out of. To some extent, you could compare a DLL with a python package, or an npm package, any library really. The following image illustrates the concept of a DLL vs an EXE quite nicely:</p>

<p>As already mentioned in the preamble, a DLL is not made to be executed on its own, as a result the conventional way of debugging cannot be achieved out of the box. </p>







<h3>Debugging method 1: Using OutputDebugString</h3>



<p>Microsoft has a function in kernel32.dll (oh look a DLL!) called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-outputdebugstringa" target="_blank">OutputDebugString</a> which will print the contents of the string into a system debugger. Visual Studio has built in capabilities to catch these outputs (more about that later). My system debugger of choice is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview" target="_blank">Dbgview.exe of the sysinternals suite.</a>  To illustrate how OutputDebugString works, I have prepared a little piece of demo code:</p>


<pre title="">// dllmain.cpp : Defines the entry point for the DLL application.
#include "pch.h"

void DemoFunction()
{
#ifdef _DEBUG
    OutputDebugStringA("[DBG] hi from demofunction!\n");
#endif
    MessageBoxA(NULL, "This is a demo!", "DLLDEMO", MB_OK);
}

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule,
                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call,
                       LPVOID lpReserved
                     )
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
#ifdef _DEBUG
        OutputDebugStringA("[DBG]hi from DllMain!");
#endif
        DemoFunction();
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;

}
</pre>


<p>As proof that a DLL cannot run by itself I attempt to start the DemoDLL using the run button in Visual Studio and get greeted by this little guy:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="5735" data-permalink="https://blog.nviso.eu/image-13/" data-orig-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png" data-orig-size="412,195" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=412" src="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=412" alt="" srcset="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png 412w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=150 150w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px"><figcaption>DLL’s don’t run on their own…</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Luckily, Microsoft has a built-in DLL loader called rundlll32.exe, but rundll32.exe can be annoying if you don’t have any exported functions (= functions to be used by other programs) in your DLL. My colleague <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.didierstevens.com/2017/09/08/quickpost-dlldemo/" target="_blank">Didier Stevens explains DLL entrypoints quite nicely in his own blogpost. If you are interested in learning more about that, please check it out!</a> </p>



<div><p>Because of the hassle of dealing with entry points, I have made a skeleton DLL loader program, easily modifiable to suit your own needs, it can be found here:  <a href="https://github.com/NVISO-BE/DLLoader">https://github.com/NVISO-BE/DLLoader</a></p><p>As you can see in the Demo code, all my ouput debug strings have “[DBG]” in them, this was not done without reason. <br>Dbgview is a system debugger, which will make a ton of noise, depending on what you have installed on the system. However, Dbgview has filter options. Because all debug strings have “[DBG]” we can instruct Dbgview to only show us these messages like so: </p></div>

<p>Everything is setup, time to run our DLL and look at the DebugView output:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="5739" data-permalink="https://blog.nviso.eu/image-3-5/" data-orig-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png" data-orig-size="471,173" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=471" src="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=471" alt="" srcset="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png 471w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=150 150w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-3.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px"><figcaption>The result of the applied filter and running the DLL</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As expected, the DebugView output shows our debug strings perfectly!</p>







<h3>Debugging method 2: using Printf</h3>



<p>This method uses <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/printf-printf-l-wprintf-wprintf-l?view=vs-2019" target="_blank">printf</a> instead of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-outputdebugstringa" target="_blank">OutputDebugString</a> so let us adapt our code: </p>


<pre title="">// dllmain.cpp : Defines the entry point for the DLL application.
#include "pch.h"
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void DemoFunction()
{
#ifdef _DEBUG
   printf("[DBG] hi from demofunction!\r\n");
#endif
    MessageBoxA(NULL, "This is a demo!", "DLLDEMO", MB_OK);
}

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule,
                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call,
                       LPVOID lpReserved
                     )
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
#ifdef _DEBUG
        printf("[DBG]hi from DllMain!\r\n");
#endif
        DemoFunction();
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;

}


</pre>


<p>Using the DLL loader, we will see all output of printf written to the DLL loader program’s standard output, which in this case is our console window.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="5742" data-permalink="https://blog.nviso.eu/image-4-4/" data-orig-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png" data-orig-size="799,102" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png?w=799" src="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png?w=799" alt="" srcset="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png 799w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png?w=150 150w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png?w=300 300w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-4.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px"><figcaption>Demo of the DLL loader program</figcaption></figure></div>







<h3>Debugging method 3: Using the DLL Loader to debug in Visual Studio </h3>



<p>Now that we have a surrogate DLL loader mechanism, we can instruct Visual Studio to use it as a parent process, this way we can run the DLL in the Visual Studio debugging environment, and we will be able to debug DLL’s just like you would be able to debug EXE’s. </p>



<p>Go to <strong>project properties</strong> and choose the <strong>Debugging tab</strong></p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="5745" data-permalink="https://blog.nviso.eu/image-5-3/" data-orig-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png" data-orig-size="529,824" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-5" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=193" data-large-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=529" src="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=529" alt="" srcset="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png 529w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=96 96w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-5.png?w=193 193w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px"><figcaption>How to get to the debugging property window in Visual Studio</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In the Command field, specify the path to the DLL loader executable, in the Command Arguments field, specify the arguments for the DLL loader, in this case the path to the debug demo DLL, as we do not have any exported function, we are not using a second argument. In case you want to use a second argument, you can, just like you would in the console. </p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="5747" data-permalink="https://blog.nviso.eu/image-6-3/" data-orig-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png" data-orig-size="1340,539" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-6" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=1024" src="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=1024 1024w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=150 150w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=300 300w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png?w=768 768w, https://nvisoblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-6.png 1340w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The debug property window in Visual Studio</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now we can setup some breakpoints in Visual Studio: </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>Depending on the complexity of your DLL code, most of the time you should be able to get away with using the DLL loader in Visual Studio so you can debug like you would debug any other program. Optionally you can combine the DLL loader with printf statements so you’ll see a real-time overview of what’s happening through the console output of the DLL loader.<br>However, if your DLL is doing complex operations such as creating new threads or doing asynchronous calls, OutputDebugString is a better option, as the DLL loader won’t take any new threads or async calls in consideration. </p>



<p>This concludes our trip into the debugging world of DLL’s. I hope this blogpost was instructive and has taught you something useful! </p>

August 27, 2020 | https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/digitale-corona-listen | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/digitale-corona-listen">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Mitglieder des Chaos Computer Clubs (CCC) haben mehrere Schwachstellen in einem weit verbreiteten Cloud-System für gastronomische Betriebe entdeckt und gemeldet. In Corona-Listen und Reservierungen waren mehrere Millionen sensible Datensätze einsehbar. Der Datenbestand reichte bis zu zehn Jahre zurück. Der Cloud-Service wurde informiert und hat die Schwachstellen nach eigenen Angaben beseitigt. Der CCC empfiehlt den Verzicht auf Cloud-Lösungen und rät dazu, Daten da zu sammeln, wo sie benötigt werden – in den Restaurants.</p><div><p>Das <a href="https://cert.ccc.de/">Chaos Emergency Response Team (CERT)</a> ist vielen bekannt als das Sanitäts- und Brandschutz-Team auf <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">Veranstaltungen des CCC</a>. Doch auch in der veranstaltungsfreien Zeit engagiert sich das CERT stets für die Sicherheit seines Umfelds.</p>
<h2>Digitale Corona-Listen</h2>
<p>Bei einem gemeinsamen Restaurantbesuch wurden Mitglieder des CERT gebeten, sich in eine <em>digitale</em> "Corona-Liste" einzutragen. Die gastgebenden Gastronominnen wollten die verpflichtende Datenerfassung offenbar modern und unkompliziert gestalten – mit Hilfe einer Cloud-Software.</p>
<p>Deren vollmundige Versprechen über die Sicherheit der erfassten Daten weckten Argwohn und Altruismus des CERT-Teams. Wie erwartet hatte das System akuten Bedarf an Sanitäts- und Brandschutzmaßnahmen durch Spezialkräfte des CCC.</p>
<h3>Über 87.000 Corona-Datensätze und 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen</h3>
<p>Verschiedene Schwachstellen ermöglichten den Zugriff auf insgesamt 87.313 Corona-Kontakterhebungen von 180 Restaurants, die das System aktiv nutzten*.</p>
<p>Im betroffenen System wurden jedoch nicht nur Corona-Listen, sondern auch Reservierungen, Bestellungen und Kassenumsätze gespeichert. <a href="https://archive.is/BS7zG">Der Cloud-Service wirbt damit</a>, monatlich über 96 Mio. Euro Umsatz von 7,7 Mio. Kundinnen sowie 600.000 Reservierungen über das System abzuwickeln*. Persönliche Daten von Besucherinnen werden vor allem bei Reservierungen und Corona-Registrierungen erfasst.</p>
<p>Insgesamt war der Zugriff auf 4,8 Mio. Personendatensätze aus über 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen möglich, wie der Cloud-Service bestätigt*.</p>
<h3>Daten reichen über ein Jahrzehnt zurück</h3>
<p>Erstaunt stellte das CERT fest, dass im System personenbezogene Daten gespeichert sind, die teilweise ein ganzes Jahrzehnt zurückreichen. Der Cloud-Service versteht sich als "<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service#Datenschutz_(DSGVO">Auftragsverarbeiter</a>" und verortet die Verantwortung zur Löschung bei den Gastronominnen. Die wiederum schienen sich dessen oft nicht bewusst zu sein und vertrauten verständlicherweise auf die Full-Service-Cloud.</p>
<h2>Mehrere Schwachstellen</h2>
<h3>Mangelndes Rechte-Management</h3>
<p>Durch eine fehlerhafte Prüfung der Zugriffsrechte konnte im Handumdrehen administrativer Vollzugriff auf sämtliche im System gespeicherten Daten erlangt werden. Andere Fehler in der API ermöglichten Nutzerinnen auch ohne besondere Rechte den Zugriff auf schützenswerte Daten, die nicht für Ihre Augen bestimmt waren. So konnte zum Beispiel Restaurant A auf die Corona-Daten von Restaurant B zugreifen.</p>
<h3>Unzureichend geschützte Passwörter</h3>
<p>Auch unzureichend geschützte Passwörter konnten mittels einfachem API-Request abgerufen werden. Dabei fielen dem Katastrophenschutz des CCC nicht nur Hashes, sondern auch Passwörter im Klartext auf. Für neuere Accounts wurde immerhin eine zeitgemäße Hashing-Methode verwendet.  Dennoch hätten in einer Stichprobe über 25% der Passwörter aus ihren Hashes geborgen werden können. Triviale Passwörter wie "1234" deuteten auf das Fehlen einer angemessenen Passwortrichtlinie hin.</p>
<p>Das Risiko schlecht geschützter Passwörter geht über den betroffenen Dienst hinaus, weil Nutzerinnen oft dazu neigen, das gleiche Passwort für mehrere Accounts zu verwenden.</p>
<h3>Großzügiges Bestellsystem</h3>
<p>Haben Sie in der Vergangenheit einmal vergeblich auf Ihr bestelltes Essen gewartet? Oder wurde Ihnen in einer Hamburger Eck-Kneipe mit 42 Litern Bier eine spontane Freude bereitet? Vielleicht hatte einfach nur eine brasilianische Teenagerin Spaß an der offenen API… Diese hat es ohne weitere Hindernisse ermöglicht,</p>
<ul>
<li>die Speisekarten aller Restaurants einzusehen und damit</li>
<li>für Dritte Bestellungen <em>auszulösen</em> oder zu <em>stornieren</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Selbstverständlich unter Umgehung sämtlicher gesetzter Einschränkungen. Weltweiter, grenzenloser Service!</p>
<h3>Schnelle Reaktion des Cloud-Anbieters</h3>
<p>Alle gefundenen Schwachstellen wurden durch die CERT-Mitglieder <em>Sophie, Martin, cwoomio, <br> deinkoks, Lady_Raven, Metal_Warrior, <br> Wellenformer, blubbel und cbro</em> <br> schriftlich dokumentiert und dem Betreiber gastronovi mit der Bitte um Behebung mitgeteilt.</p>
<p>In einer zügigen Reaktion bestätigte gastronovi alle gemeldeten Schwachstellen und machte sich an die umgehende Behandlung. Den lebensrettenden Sofortmaßnahmen folgt auf Rat des CCC nun auch eine ausführliche Diagnostik des Systems durch geschultes Fachpersonal.</p>
<h2>CCC rät von digitalen "Corona-Listen" ab</h2>
<p>Laut gastronovi sind die gemeldeten Schwachstellen inzwischen kuriert. Doch auch <a href="https://www.modzero.com/modlog/archives/2020/07/06/mit_webapps_gegen_covid-19/index.html">in den Systemen anderer Cloud-Services wurden bereits ähnliche Schwachstellen gefunden</a>.</p>
<p><em>"Denken first, digital second",</em> kommentiert Linus Neumann, Sprecher des Chaos Computer Clubs. <em>"Viele digitale Corona-Listen wurden mit der heißen Nadel gestrickt und machen schwer zu haltende Datenschutzversprechen. Die Sicherheit eines Papiersystems ist hingegen auch für Laien leicht zu beurteilen."</em></p>
<p>So haben etablierte Cloud-Services bestehende Systeme oft nur hastig "umfunktioniert", statt sich spezifisch mit den Sicherheits- und Datenschutzanforderungen des Contact-Tracings auseinanderzusetzen.</p>
<p><em>"Die sensiblen Daten landen dann nicht etwa beim Restaurant, sondern auf einem großen Haufen irgendwo im Internet, wo sie die nächsten Jahre auf interessierte Hackerinnen warten."</em></p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für Besucherinnen</h3>
<p>Sollte Ihr präferiertes Restaurant auf Cloud-Erfassung <em>bestehen</em>, raten wir zu neuen kulinarischen Abenteuern in anderen Etablissements.</p>
<p>Doch auch bei papierbasierter Erfassung empfiehlt der CCC das <a href="https://twitter.com/frank_rieger/status/1289113251461173248">Einrichten einer gesonderten pseudonymen E-Mail-Adresse nur für diesen Zweck</a>. Viele kostenlose Dienstanbieter ermöglichen zum Beispiel eine Weiterleitung von eingehenden Nachrichten an die eigentliche E-Mail-Adresse.</p>
<p>Fünfzehn Minuten Aufwand gewährleisten Datensparsamkeit ohne das Risiko, eine wichtige Warnung zu verpassen.</p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für die sichere Erfassung</h3>
<p>Der Chaos Computer Club rät grundsätzlich von digitalen Corona-Listen ab – erst recht, wenn diese ihre Daten in einer Cloud speichern, statt im Restaurant.</p>
<p>Auch in unseren eigenen Hackspaces verwenden wir folgendes Papier-System:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jede Besucherin oder Gruppe erhält einen <em>gesonderten Zettel</em> zur Erfassung, damit nicht die Daten anderer Gäste eingesehen werden können.</li>
<li>Der ausgefüllte Zettel wird in einen verschlossenen Briefkasten geworfen, um ihn dort <em>vor neugierigen Blicken zu schützen</em>.</li>
<li>Dieser wird am Ende des Tages in einen Umschlag geleert, welcher mit dem <em>Datum des erfassten Tages beschriftet und versiegelt</em> wird.</li>
<li>Die versiegelten Umschläge werden an einem <em>sicheren Ort</em> aufbewahrt.</li>
<li>Täglich wird ein Umschlag <em>sicher vernichtet</em>, dessen Frist abgelaufen ist – und ein neuer kommt hinzu.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Empfehlungen an den Gesetzgeber</h3>
<p>Das Ziel, Besucherinnen im Falle eines Falles schnell informieren zu können, ist legitim und wichtig. Dennoch wurden dem Unterfangen eine Reihe unnötiger Probleme in den Weg gelegt</p>
<ol>
<li>Es häufen sich die Fälle, in denen die <a href="https://www.haufe.de/compliance/recht-politik/polizeizugriff-auf-corona-gaestelisten-der-gastronomie-unzulaessig_230132_522174.html">Listen für Polizei-Ermittlungen zweckentfremdet wurden</a>. Derartige Maßnahmen motivieren Besucherinnen, falsche Daten in die Listen einzutragen.</li>
<li>Der Gesetzgeber sieht keinen Anlass, <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2020/gastro-vorratsdatenspeicherung-bundesregierung-will-corona-listen-nicht-besser-schuetzen/">diesem Datenmissbrauch ein Ende zu setzen</a>.  Damit wird das geringe verbliebene Vertrauen weiter untergraben.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/corona-und-restaurants-kundendaten-fuer-einen-schnellen-flirt-a-453e410e-50d4-4d2a-a128-fdaa2b34eee2">In vielen Einrichtungen liegen die Listen offen aus, was die Sorge vor unerwünschtem Kontakt durch andere Gäste weckt</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Leichtfertig verspieltes Vertrauen kann jetzt nur noch durch eine klare gesetzliche Regelung zurückgewonnen werden.</p>

When Chrome version 85 is released, it will <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/08/highlighting-great-user-experiences-on.html">apply the label “Fast page” to links</a> on web pages.</p><p>The label appears on a menu when a user does a long-press on a link. It only displays when a destination page is considered fast based on Core Web Vitals and real-world data from Chrome users. However, if a page is considered fast by Core Web Vitals, but there isn’t enough real-world data for the page, it won’t display the label.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1234" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png" alt="Fast page label" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png 2048w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-300x181.png 300w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1024x617.png 1024w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-768x463.png 768w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1536x926.png 1536w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1046x630.png 1046w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-150x90.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"><figcaption>Chrome 85 will have “Fast page” label when a user long-presses a link</figcaption></figure><p>The label is likely a taste of how Google will be incorporating Core Web Vitals into Google Search. It’s highly probable that Google will use a label or icon to denote fast pages, similar to what they do now for AMP pages.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>As my dev workstation is running Ubuntu, I have recently started using <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap</a>
to install most of my applications.</p>
<p>Snap is an interesting packaging approach since it allows applications publisher to release new versions
directly without having to involve distribution maintainers. This reduces the delay between application development
and end users deployment.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of Snap is that they are self-contained and running in a sandbox with limited access to the
host system. This isolation improves security and allows multiples version of the same snap to be installed at the
same time.</p>
<p>The packaging of Snap applications is really simple and is done with a single file <code>snapcraft.yaml</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s as example the configuration file of <a href="https://github.com/creekorful/osync">osync</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: osync
<span>base</span>: core18
<span>version</span>: git
<span>summary</span>: Tool to synchronize in a optimized way a lot of files to a FTP server.
<span>description</span>: <span>|
</span><span>  Osync is a Rust written tool designed to upload huge amount of files</span>
  to a remote FTP server, in an efficient manner.
<span>license</span>: GPL<span>-3.0</span>

<span>grade</span>: stable
<span>confinement</span>: strict

<span>parts</span>:
  <span>osync</span>:
    <span>plugin</span>: rust
    <span>source</span>: .
    <span>build-packages</span>:
      - libc6-dev

<span>apps</span>:
  <span>osync</span>:
    <span>command</span>: bin/osync
    <span>plugs</span>:
      - home
      - removable-media
      - network
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, Snap packaging is quite straightforward and simple, but I think we can improve the experience.
That’s what I’ve tried with <a href="https://github.com/creekorful/autosnap">autosnap</a>.</p>

<p>Autosnap allows automatic snap packaging easily in a fashion way:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ autosnap https://github.com/creekorful/polonium.git
2020-08-27 07:23:32,400 INFO  <span>[</span>autosnap<span>]</span> Starting packaging of https://github.com/creekorful/polonium.git
2020-08-27 07:23:33,617 INFO  <span>[</span>autosnap<span>]</span> Successfully packaged polonium!
2020-08-27 07:23:33,617 INFO  <span>[</span>autosnap<span>]</span> The snapcraft file is stored at /home/creekorful/Documents/polonium/snapcraft.yaml
2020-08-27 07:23:33,618 INFO  <span>[</span>autosnap<span>]</span> Please fix any TODO in the file and run <span>`</span>cd /home/creekorful/Documents/polonium <span>&amp;&amp;</span> snapcraft<span>`</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Depending on the language that will be packaged, autosnap will be able to detect the license,
the build packages, the version, etc… and therefore ease the life of package maintainer.</p>
<p>Current languages supported by Autosnap are: [Go, Rust] (new languages will be supported soon).</p>
<p>The source code of autosnap is available <a href="https://github.com/creekorful/autosnap">here</a>.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p><p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. But, installing and using them appears to be difficult for a large number of users.</p><p>I see these questions often on Stackoverflow and similar websites -</p><ul><li>how to compute VMAF?</li><li>how do I compile VMAF on Ubuntu?</li><li>how do I calcuate VMAF using FFmpeg?</li><li>no such filter <code>libvmaf</code> when trying to use VMAF with FFmpeg.</li><li>VMAF example commandline</li></ul><p>and the list simply goes on. So, I decided to write down the steps of compiling and installing VMAF, FFmpeg, and computing VMAF with FFmpeg. Along the way, I’ll show you a few gotchas and common errors in the installation and usage procedure.</p><h2 id="step-0-machine-setup">Step 0: Machine Setup</h2><p>For the purpose of this document, I will set up a new $5 droplet on DigitalOcean with Ubuntu 18.04 as its operating system.</p><p>By the way, if you <a href="https://m.do.co/c/90eb9b431b9e">click here</a>, you'll receive $100 in DigitalOcean credits over 60 days! That's 60 days and $100 to experiment and play around with DigitalOcean :)</p><h2 id="step-1-install-vmaf-on-ubuntu-1804">Step 1: Install VMAF on Ubuntu 18.04</h2><p>You can use VMAF in several different ways and you can <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf">read about it here</a>. In order to use VMAF with FFmpeg, we need the help of <code>libvmaf</code> - a C library that can be used with C/C++ code. In other words, we can use it with FFmpeg.</p><p>So, here is how to install VMAF on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the latest release of VMAF from <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/releases">here</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/archive/v1.5.2.tar.gz

sudo make 
sudo make install
</code></pre></div><p>Make a note of where VMAF’s <code>libvmaf</code> got installed. In my machine, it was installed to <code>/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu</code> as per the console log.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">Installing src/libvmaf.so.0.0.0 to /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

You should now have an FFmpeg build with VMAF enabled.</p><h2 id="step-3-computing-ffmpeg-with-vmaf">Step 3: Computing FFmpeg with VMAF</h2><p>Now let’s see how we can calculate the VMAF score between two videos using FFmpeg and VMAF.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Let’s create two test videos - a 1920x1080p30 video and a 1280x720p30 video using FFmpeg’s built-in libraries that generates test data. The commandlines are shown below and as you can see, it will generate two 5-second duration clips, 30 fps, of 1920x1080p and 1280x720p resolution.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">bin/ffmpeg -f lavfi -i <span>testsrc</span>=<span>duration</span>=5:size=1920x1080:rate=<span>30</span> test_1080p30.mpg
bin/ffmpeg -f lavfi -i <span>testsrc</span>=<span>duration</span>=5:size=1280x720:rate=<span>30</span> test_720p30.mpg
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2: Compute the VMAF score between the two videos.</strong><br>From the commandline below, you can see that we are providing the two input sequences, and then we are scaling both to 1920x1080 using a <code>bicubic</code> filter. This is important because VMAF works only on sequences having the same resolution (and the frame rate should match, else you’ll have serious problems). We are also asking FFmpeg to compute the PSNR score for these two sequences.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mpg -i test_1080p30.mpg -filter_complex <span>"[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; [main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json"</span> -f null -
</code></pre></div><p>and it should print the VMAF score as follows on the console</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">[libvmaf @ 0x55803f80c7c0] VMAF score: 86.375268
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><ol><li>The detailed per-frame details are contained in the JSON file. It contains the per-frame VMAF and PSNR scores as requested.</li><li>In FFmpeg’s filter, you can use either <code>bicubic</code> or <code>lancsoz</code> filters for the upsampling process. Netflix <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/vmaf-the-journey-continues-44b51ee9ed12">suggests</a> that <code>bicubic</code> is a better choice.</li></ol><h2 id="options-for-vmaf-using-ffmpeg">Options for VMAF using FFmpeg</h2><p>The following commandline options are available in FFmpeg for computing VMAF.</p><ul><li><code>model_path</code>
Set the model path which is to be used for SVM. Default value: <code>/usr/local/share/model/vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl</code></li><li><code>log_path</code>
Set the file path to be used to store logs.</li><li><code>log_fmt</code>
Set the format of the log file (xml or json).</li><li><code>enable_transform</code>
This option can enable/disable the score_transform applied to the final predicted VMAF score, if you have specified score_transform option in the input parameter file passed to run_vmaf_training.py Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>phone_model</code>
Invokes the phone model which will generate VMAF scores higher than in the regular model, which is more suitable for laptop, TV, etc. viewing conditions. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>psnr</code>
Enables computing psnr along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>ssim</code>
Enables computing ssim along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>ms_ssim</code>
Enables computing ms_ssim along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>pool</code>
Set the pool method to be used for computing vmaf. Options are <code>min</code>, <code>harmonic_mean</code> or <code>mean</code> (default).</li><li><code>n_threads</code>
Set number of threads to be used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>0</code>, which makes use of all available logical processors.</li><li><code>n_subsample</code>
Set interval for frame subsampling used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>1</code></li><li><code>enable_conf_interval</code>
Enables confidence interval. Default value: <code>false</code></li></ul><h2 id="common-problems-while-using-vmaf-and-ffmpeg">Common problems while using VMAF and FFmpeg.</h2><p>P1. While installing FFmpeg from the official compilation guide on Ubuntu 18.04, you will face this error <code>ERROR: gnutls not found using pkg-config</code>. To prevent this, you need to install <code>sudo apt-get install libunistring-dev</code>.</p><p>P2. Another common problem when running FFmpeg with VMAF is this <code>error libvmaf xxx not found using pkg config</code>. This means that while compiling FFmpeg, you didn’t tell it where the <code>libvmaf</code> files are. Simply run the export command and it should fix the issue.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>export</span> <span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>=<span>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

<h3>1.
	Prioritize lifestyle design.
</h3><p>
	You’ve made it, so it’s all about you, now.  Make your dreams come true.
</p><p>
	Shape your surroundings to please your every desire.
</p><p>
	Make your <a href="https://sive.rs/book/TimeParadox">immediate gratification</a> the most important thing.
</p>

<h3>2.
	Chase that comparison moment.
</h3><p>
	You have the old thing. You want the new thing.
	Yes! Do it! Be happy for a week.
</p><p>
	Ignore the fact that the <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StumblingOnHappiness">happiness only comes from the moment of comparison between the old and new</a>.
</p><p>
	Once you’ve had your new thing for a week, and it becomes the new norm, seek happiness from another new thing.
</p>

<h3>3.
	Buy, not rent.
</h3><p>
	Why rent a house, castle, boat, or car, when you can buy?
</p><p>
	It’s not about the thing, it’s about identity.
	This shows who you are now.
</p>

<h3>4.
	Internalize your new status.
</h3><p>
	You worked hard to get here.
	Celebrate. Relax.
</p><p>
	Admit you are in a different class of people now, with different needs.
</p><p>
	Understand there is no going back.
</p>

<h3>5.
	Be a connoisseur.
</h3><p>
	Learn what others say is the finest.
</p><p>
	Insist on only the finest.
</p><p>
	You will now be <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StoicJoy">unhappy</a> with anything but the finest.
</p>

<h3>6.
	Get to know your possessions.
</h3><p>
	Now that you own the best, it’s time to focus on what you’ve got.
</p><p>
	Learn all about the features of your new possessions.
</p><p>
	Spend more time getting your surround sound and heated floor just right.
</p><p>
	Work out the solar panel charging of your Tesla car.
	This is important.
</p>

<h3>7.
	Acclimate to comfort.
</h3><p>
	Eliminate every discomfort from your life.

			<div heateor-sss-data-href="https://koyastack.com/2020/08/28/wordpress-as-a-service-ripplepop/"><p>Share with friends and family</p><ul></ul></div><p><span><strong>Ripplepop</strong> is a WordPress support service for serious website owners and agencies. According to their website “RipplePop provides simple, reliable, and scalable daily WordPress help.”, That means you can hire any of Ripplepop’s WordPress developer to handle all your WordPress tasks or headaches. One of the “unique feature” of Ripplepop is their flexible pricing, you don’t need to sign any contract when you subscribe and you can cancel your subscription anytime you aren’t satisfied with their services.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Initial Product// Jordan Johnson</strong> co-founded Ripplepop with his friend Michael. Jordan started his journey in 2014 when he was working at a top ad agency, Ogilvy and Mather, then he started BuildThis, a startup that build websites and software for customers. BuildThis was later sold to a company but the company didn’t want to keep majority of the BuildThis customers… They basically bought BuildThis for the brand name.</span></p>
<p><span>Jordan and Michael saw an opportunity to continue serving BuildThis’s (The startup they sold) customers, so they started Ripplepop. Now they continued building websites and serving these customers under the Ripplepop brand but they struggled with feast and famine.</span></p>
<p><span>“So the problem that we were often facing was that it just felt like we were searching for the next big sale to keep us running for two to three months where all we were doing was fishing for the next big job that would keep the doors open.” — Jordan Johnson.</span></p>
<p><span>They quickly realized that the model of searching for their next big client to pay bills wasn’t sustainable and it was way too stressful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In search for a better model they discovered that a website called WPCurve was purchased by GoDaddy. WPCurve offered WordPress support to small business owners that don’t have time to manage and maintain their website.</span></p>
<p><span>WPCurve model looked like a better model for Ripplepop to adopt, so Jordan and Michael devised a monthly support plan to focus on generating “predictable” monthly recurring revenue rather than just being paid per website build project which comes with feast and famine.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Traction// Ripplepop</strong> got it’s initial customers from BuildThis. BuildThis had a good amount of customers that still needed WordPress help, so Ripplepop started serving them, so this was a solid start for Ripplepop. After a while, Jordan and Michael started figuring out how to attract new customers and Facebook ads was their clear choice because they need to maximize their time as a two persons business.</span></p>

<p><span>Jordan and Michael began to test different ads to different audiences, this strategy helped them discover the different audience and ad creatives that worked and converted well for them.</span></p>
<p><span>“Now all we do is run ads to our audiences we know work, and then continually test ads on new audiences to see what else might work.” — Jordan Johnson</span></p>
<p><span>In a subscription business, one of the biggest problem you face is churn, so Ripplepop retains their customers by offering them quality and customer friendly WordPress developers that can get work done fast and excellently. Aside from quality developers, customer communication and experience is another way Ripplepop retains it’s customers, they try to provide their customers with the best experience (onboarding, quality of service, customer support, etc) and constantly ask for feedback.</span></p>
<p><span>“A happy customer won’t leave your service if they can afford it or if they are able to make a profit from your service. Keeping your customers happy is the key to developing strong and long-lasting relationships.” — Jordan Johnson.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Business Model// Ripplepop</strong> is a subscription based WordPress support service where customers pay a fee to hire a developer for WordPress help. Customers work out their Ripplepop developer’s daily schedule and invite these developers to their existing project management tools (Slack, Asana, Basecamp, etc.) for daily WordPress tasks.</span></p>
<p><span>Ripplepop initially started with $79/month subscription plan for a single website, then extended to a $370/month plan for unlimited websites before switching completely to weekly plans that enables developers do daily and weekly tasks for a fee… Daily and weekly pricing include 2 hours of daily work (10hours/week), 4 hours of daily work (20 hours/ week) and 8 hours of daily work (40 hours/week) on a few sites.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span>What’s next for you?</span></strong></h3>

<p><span>WordPress websites has a recurring need for support and maintenance, this fact has given rise in WordPress support services like Ripplepop where businesses can hire WordPress developers. This model has helped Ripplepop make monthly recurring revenue and don’t forget WordPress powers over 30% of the websites on the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span>Most small businesses have got their website running on WordPress CMS but they don’t have the technical expertise and time to manage and maintain their WordPress website.</span></p>
<p><span>Sounds like an opportunity?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Like Jordan and Michael:</span></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><span> Offering WordPress website build isn’t enough anymore, add a recurring revenue service such as “WordPress support” to avoid feast and famine.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Setup a website, your website should explain what you are offering, in simple terms. Example: RipplePop provides simple, reliable, and scalable daily WordPress help.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Showcase your pricing packages, the expected delivery time and outcome on your website. Setup recurring payment pages on stripe and PayPal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>NB: Your pricing packages should flexible and affordable, whether daily, weekly or monthly.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span> There should be an easy medium for your customers to reach out to you when they visit your website. Integrate live a chat software like tawk.to and add a link to email and/or WhatsApp on the website.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Testimonials matter. Look for testimonials and add to your website.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Run Facebook ads to get traction, test different ads to different audiences. Measure what works and what doesn’t.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Hire or partner with quality WP developers. Train them to be customer friendly and deliver their task fast.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Customer experience is an important key to customer retention. Deliver seamless onboarding process, the best customer support and quality of service.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Your developers should be able to work with your customers in their preferred project management tools. Example: John, a WordPress developer should be able to work with ABC Company on Slack, ABC’s preferred project management tool.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Ask your customers for feedback. Customer feedback is important. Take it seriously.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span> Look for a mentor, someone running a website development or support service to guide you on your journey. You could hire a business coach.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Probably one of the most well-known post-explotation techniques used in pentests, and in Red Team operations, is to drop a backdoor in the PAM ecosystem in order to collect valid credentials. The credentials catched by our backdoor will help us to perform easily the lateral movement between machines. We can achieve this though different options.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An interesting twist is to mix up this technique with the classic DNS exfiltration, so we can send the credentials to our C&amp;C without worry about firewalls and traffic rules. We only need to send a DNS request to the DNS server used by the machine, then it will be forwarded to other DNS servers, and at some point the request will hit our Authoritative DNS Server. So we can retrieve silently credentials using this well-known covert channel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our roadmap is pretty simple: add a custom PAM module that logs the credential in plaintext and send it to our C&amp;C though a DNS resolution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As side note: even if this is an old and well-known tactic, it keep being a really cool way to show the needed of file integrity controls. Root a server, wait until an administrator or operator log in via SSH and <strong>enjoy! :)</strong></p>

<h2 id="0x01-modifying-pam_unix_authc">0x01 Modifying pam_unix_auth.c</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>(We are not going to explain what is PAM or how it works. To get a deeper information about PAM, use</em> <code>man</code><em>).</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In order to retrieve the user and password in clear text we are going to <strong>replace the valid pam_unix.so</strong> module to one modified by us. If we check the source code of the original module (download the source code of the PAM version installed in your target server from <a href="http://www.linux-pam.org/library/">here</a>), we can see at the pam_unix_auth.c file a function called pam_sm_authenticate, and inside this function a call to <strong>_unix_verify_password</strong> which arguments are the username and password used in the authentication:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// (...)</span>
	<span>/* verify the password of this user */</span>
	<span>retval</span> <span>=</span> <span>_unix_verify_password</span><span>(</span><span>pamh</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span><span>,</span> <span>ctrl</span><span>);</span>
	<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>

	<span>AUTH_RETURN</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// (...)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So looks fine to inject our exfiltration logic at this point. As PoC, we can use <a href="https://gist.github.com/fffaraz/9d9170b57791c28ccda9255b48315168">this snippet of code (Silver Moon - 29/4/2009)</a>, so the main exfiltration logic is implemented yet (this code has some bugs -for example it does not take the server IP from resolv.conf-… so if you are going to use it in a real pentest, reimplement the code ;D). Lets vim the pam_unix_auth.c file to add the functions and headers needed!:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* Fun starts here :)

 * pam_sm_authenticate() performs UNIX/shadow authentication
 *
 *      First, if shadow support is available, attempt to perform
 *      authentication using shadow passwords. If shadow is not
 *      available, or user does not have a shadow password, fallback
 *      onto a normal UNIX authentication
 */</span>
<span>/* Backdoor  - DNS code extracted from https://gist.github.com/fffaraz/9d9170b57791c28ccda9255b48315168 */</span>


<span>// The code sucks a lot. It is Sunday and I have a hangover, so I am not in the mood to fix it. </span>
<span>// Tons of bug and useless code that you should remove. Forgive me, please :)</span>

The idea is a simple one- many Makers asked me over the last year about printing smaller parts for the <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">Raspberry Pi Recovery Kit</a>, and I started playing around with options.  I knew I didn’t want to just re-hash the old deck, and I knew I really wanted a better display for this year.  Let’s jump in with what’s different:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>No Pelican case required!  It’s pretty obvious from the photos that you don’t need to spend $50 or more on a case, especially if you are going to drill holes in it, or don’t actually need a waterproof case.</p></li><li><p>Smaller Bill of Materials (BOM).  The original Raspberry Pi Recovery kit was very expensive to build, primarily because I sourced the coolest looking parts I could, which can be expensive or just hard to get (like the keyboard).  This project has a much simpler BOM, so simple that here it is:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>1 kg spool of Paramount 3D’s Olive Green PETG - <a href="https://amzn.to/31lMcqy">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>(Optional) 1K spool of Carbon Fiber PETG and hardened steel nozzle - <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/carbon-fiber-pro-series-petg-filament-1.75mm/sk/MHQ646TD">Link</a> and <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/e3d-v6-extra-nozzle-hardened-steel-1.75mm-x-0.40mm/sk/MSDV7HN9">Link</a></p></li><li><p>Low profile, stainless steel M5 screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/92855A513/">McMaster Carr Link</a></p></li><li><p>M5 threaded rod - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93325A413/">McMaster Carr</a> (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Evq9Vu">bolt cutters</a> are optional, but use safety gear)</p></li><li><p>Four threaded inserts - <a href="https://amzn.to/2FWzNBj">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Pimoroni HDMI Display - <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4337">Adafruit Link</a></p></li><li><p>Short HDMI Cable - <a href="https://amzn.to/31tQP21">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Four brass M2.5 standoffs - <a href="https://amzn.to/2CUUKeF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Raspberry Pi 4 - <a href="https://amzn.to/2YwHFzF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Core Design - <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/b4bWC7f62Ab-sizzling-fyyran/">Tinkercad Print Layout</a>, <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eTexyDTsTKR-stunning-kieran/">Tinkercad Assembled Version</a>, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579460">Thingiverse</a></p></li><li><p>Thumb Screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93886A240/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li><li><p>Cord Grip - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/8302K161/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Something easier to modify/hack over time.  The <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">RPRK</a> was designed to be a “finished” product and execution on an idea, and with people making their own, I thought it would be more fun this time around if people could swap out parts for their own, even ones to radically change the look of the deck.</p></li><li><p>I abandoned panel mount ports on this project.  Panel mounts are often for looks only, at least on many of my older builds, and to keep costs down I just ditched them.  Big, rounded rectangle holes work for me, and don’t cost $15 each time I want to change something.</p></li><li><p>Finally, I wanted a design I could continue to refine and modify for my own projects.  Hopefully I’ll have more of those to share soon!</p></li></ul><p>With that out of the way, let’s go over the basic design.  This can be used as assembly instructions in a pinch too.  Here’s the front frame, which the Pimoroni display will connect to.  That’s really done last, so we won’t see this part again for a while.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597467959462_38425"><p>With that out of the way let’s focus on the main frame, which helps hold it all together.  Here are some of the parts.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_18333"><div><p>The design is simple for the front- there are four threaded inserts for holding the display on the front.  Make sure they go on the front of the front frame.  There are two halves of the front frame, which is held together by the “joiner” part, which has spare M5 holes in case you want to mount something here.  I was still on a carbon fiber kick (read: I still had the hardened steel nozzle installed) so that part was printed with that stuff.  It’s great, but not required if you don’t want to deal with a second and somewhat picky filament.</p><p>Next it’s all about printing all of the rear parts, including what I call the ends and the top/bottom.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_22206"><p>The top and bottom parts are not interchangeable between top and bottom, they go on one orientation only.  This will likely take a while to print!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_26233"><div><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong></p><p>As you start to assemble be careful of the resistance of some of the deeper holes that screws and threaded rods are going into.  If you feel too much resistance you may need to drill or tap some of the holes- this depends a ton on your printer.  This is especially true of the M5 threaded rod in the next section, which can get bound in the many parts and get very difficult to move.  If you think that’s happening, back out the M5 rod and use a power drill to drill the part holes.  You really only need threading on the parts on each end of the enclosure, and even if you drill it all out, end caps/nuts will do fine to hold the whole thing together.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_27776"><div>

This design took about 7 months to design, including a 3 month break due to life and COVID impacts.  I am lucky so far to be able to continue to work on these projects, and it’s been a great relief to “finish” it.  Like all of my previous projects here, all of the design files and parts lists are in this article so people can make/modify as they see fit.  I would remind fellow makers that it’s licensed under a non-commercial license, so while you can print/modify, doing so commercially is not supported under this project.  Want to do that?  Just reach out to me and we can figure something out.</p><p>Going forward though, many of my originals like this one will be for sale in my shop.  They will be more expensive than making it yourself, so if you’re willing to try- make one!  Commissions are limited and not guaranteed, so the items from my project builds may not last.

<p><a href="https://airport.community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airport</a> is a new service that came to life in recent weeks for helping people discover applications available for testing under the TestFlight service from Apple. Think of Airport as the TestFlight App Store but everything is free. I had a chance to enter the beta of Airport, here are my impressions.</p>

<p>When an app developer wants people to test an application, they can use Apple’s TestFlight service to make a special version of their app installable outside of the App Store, through TestFlight service. People can access a pre-release version of an application by installing it on their device only if they receive an invite for testing purposes. There is a big problem with TestFlight: there is no centralized repository of apps available for testing. This is where Airport comes into play. It is a catalogue of apps that you can install for free on your device. These apps are still in development and are prone to crashing or malfunction. Also, these apps will stop working after 90 days or when the developer decide to remove the build from TestFlight. So, in summary, think of Airport as a front-end catalogue to TestFlight. </p>



<blockquote><p>There is a big problem with TestFlight: there is no centralized repository of apps available for testing.</p></blockquote>



<h2>My personal experience with Airport</h2>



<p>After using Airport for a few days, I can only say that not only this is a brilliant idea, it works really well and its design feels very “Apple-ly”. In fact, I wonder why Apple didn’t come up with this idea. I think they could introduce a new section on the App Store for application testing, something along the line of what Steam offers for games in a pre-release state. I suspect Apple won’t offer something like this as they probably don’t want people to have an easy way to access buggy apps. </p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there are more than 300 apps available. Onboarding an app for testing is simple: you browse the catalogue, tap an app to see the application page with description, screenshots, just like on the App Store, then you hit the Get button in order to launch TestFlight and finish the onboarding process there. The process works perfectly hand in hand with TestFlight. The latter has to be installed on your device, though. </p>



<p>While using Airport , it is easy to forget that you are not browsing the actual App Store. The design of Airport is clean, simple and effective. Bravo to the guys behind this: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/jsngr?s=21" target="_blank">@jsngr</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/SiddDevs?s=21" target="_blank">@sidddevs</a>. Now, here is a simple question: will these guys submit Airport to Apple for approval and make it available in the App Store? I’m not sure. Even if they wanted to, will Apple’s review team accept it? It’s far from certain. Apple these days seems very picky and can reject an app pretty easily.</p>



<h2>Living on the bleeding edge</h2>

<p>One thing that is cool with Airport is that you can easily find apps that will take advantage of iOS latest APIs and technologies like widgets. So, if you are running iOS 14 on your device <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/07/18/going-all-in-with-ios-14-ipados-14-macos-11-big-sur-and-watchos-7-betas/" target="_blank">as I do</a>, you can also get apps that will take advantage of newly introduced operating system features. Pretty neat. </p>



<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>



<p>Looking forward, I have to wonder about the future of Airport. Could Apple buy the service and make its own? Probably but very unlikely. Could Apple send a cease and desist order to bring it down? Unfortunately, Apple’s attitude in recent weeks and months makes me think this could happen. I wouldn’t bet against it.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, if you want to have a shot at Airport, you’ll have to register with your email address and… wait. There is a lineup to enter the TestFlight remaining slots. Have fun! </p>

   <!-- Title -->
   
  
   <p>The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer, 
      distributed computer network that can be accessed from the 
      Internet.  Some might call it a new Internet
      separate from the regular Internet.  In a peer-to-peer network, 
      computers talk to each other directly, rather than through a 
      central server.  This makes peer-to-peer networks much less 
      susceptible to censorship of information.  In 2017, when the 
      Turkish government declared Wikipedia to be a 
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171018092720/http://observer.com/2017/05/turkey-wikipedia-ipfs/">threat to its national security</a> and 
      blocked it in Turkey, a turkish-language copy of Wikipedia was 
      put on the IPFS. 
      Although development of the IPFS is still on-going, and issues still 
      need to be resolved, anyone can use the IPFS for free right now to 
      access information or even to create their own static website, 
      without paying domain name registration fees.</p>

   <div><p>In this article, I will explain how to install software onto your
      computer for accessing the IPFS 
      and show how to access information stored on the IPFS.  I'll leave 
      a tutorial on creating IPFS websites for another time.
   </p></div><h2>Installing the IPFS Desktop onto Your Computer</h2>
   <p>Since many novice computer users are not completely comfortable 
      installing random software from the Internet onto their computers, 
      I'll try to give some of the details they may need to successfully 
      install the IPFS software.  First, the IPFS software runs on 
      Windows, Apple, and Linux 
      computers.  There are two versions, the 
      command line version and the GUI version.  I'll assume that most 
      people would rather run the GUI version, so that is the version on 
      which I will focus our attention.  But, if you prefer the command 
      line version, called "go-ipfs", it can be found 
      <a href="https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs">here</a>. You do not have 
      to install the command line version before installing the GUI 
      version.</p>

   <p>To install the GUI version of the IPFS software, called "IPFS 
      desktop", go to 
      this Github <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop">page</a> 
      on the Internet.  Github code is opensource, so Github is generally 
      considered a safe place from which to download code.  I'm not sure 
      about binaries (executable programs), however, so download at your 
      own risk.  Honestly, I doubt there is much risk associated with
      downloading this software from Github or in using it to access the IPFS. 
      Linux users: go two-thirds of the way down the 
      page to the Linux installation packages section, and select the 
      package that is appropriate for your version of Linux.  
      Windows 10 users: download the 64-bit binary of the 
      IPFS desktop labeled "ipfs-desktop-setup-0.8.0.exe".  If a newer 
      version is available by the time you read this article, then install 
      the newer version.  A 32-bit binary version of the IPFS desktop does 
      not appear to be available, so if you are running a 32-bit version 
      of Windows, you will either have to run the 32-bit, command-line 
      version of go-ipfs or download the source code for the IPFS 
      desktop and compile it yourself.</p>

   <p>On Windows, once 
      "ipfs-desktop-setup-0.8.0.exe" is on your hard drive, double click 
      on it to start the installation.  When the blue IPFS desktop 
      icon appears on your Windows desktop, the IPFS desktop has been 
      installed.</p>

   <p>Linux users: on Linux Mint 17, the IPFS desktop installs
      into the /opt/IPFS Desktop directory.  When I installed the IPFS desktop
      onto my Linux machine, despite the fact that the deb package
      installation process produced a message that said all 
      dependencies had been satisfied, libnss3 was
      missing.  After I installed libnss3 (using "sudo apt-get install
      libnss3") and started running the IPFS desktop program, the 
      IPFS desktop blue cube icon appeared on my task bar at the bottom of my
      monitor.</p>

   <h2>Running the IPFS Desktop</h2>
   <div><p>To run the IPFS desktop in Windows, just double click on its icon 
      on your Windows desktop.  Nothing appears to happen, but if you 
      click on the appropriate icon on your Windows menu bar (for Windows 
      7, that's the icon that is used to eject USB devices), you will 
      see the IPFS desktop's blue cube icon.  Left click on that icon 
      and select "status" to bring up the status page of IPFS panel that looks 
      like this: 
   </p></div><center>
   <img src="https://cheapskatesguide.org/pics/ipfs-status-page.jpg" alt="IPFS Status Panel"> 
   </center>

   <p>

      Except perhaps for the IPFS desktop's blue cube icon appearing 
      in a different location on the task bar, the Windows and Linux 
      versions of the IPFS desktop appear to work exactly the same.
      Some of the things the status page shows are:
      </p><ul>
        <li>The installed version of go-ipfs</li>
        <br>

        <li>The amount of storage space taken up on your computer's hard
            drive by IPFS content data files (should currently be 
            something small, like 64 KB)</li>
        <br>

        <li>The number of peers (other computers currently on the IPFS 
            network)</li>
        <br>

        <li>A history of the IPFS network traffic to and from your computer</li>
      </ul>
      

   <p>I noticed a couple of other interesting things on the status page 
      of the IPFS pannel.  One was that a significant amount of traffic 
      appeared as soon as I started running the IPFS desktop for the 
      first time (like a few kb/s outgoing), when I would have thought 
      nothing should have been 
      happening.  And, after 5 minutes or so, I had about 600 KB of 
      IPFS content data files on my hard drive, according to the 
      status page.  Another 
      thing I noticed was that the number of peers varied greatly, from 
      less than ten at times to over 100 at other times.  I don't know 
      why this is, but I would guess that one of the things it means 
      is that you may have to wait for a while before a peer comes on 
      line that has a copy of the file you want.</p>
   <h2>Finding Content on the IPFS Network</h2>
   <p>There are three ways to access information on the IPFS network.  
      The first is by clicking on the "explore" link on the left side of 
      the IPFS desktop panel.  Then click on one of the links to content that 
      come up on the right side of the panel. Then click on the "view on 
      IPFS gateway" link.  Your Internet browser should come up and 
      connect to the page you selected.  This can take a while, because 
      the IPFS network can be slow at times.  Glacially slow.  Downloading a 
      random 800 KB page took me 5 to 10 minutes.  At other times,
      the IPFS network is just as fast as the regular Internet.</p>

   <p>The second way to get to content on the IPFS is to bring up your 
      regular Internet browser and copy and paste an IPFS document 
      address (from wherever you may have found it) onto the browser's 
      URL line.  Naturally, the IPFS desktop must be running for this 
      method to work.  For example, by searching on the regular Internet 
      on duckduckgo.com for "IPFS links", I found this IPFS link to an 
      IPFS blog that explains how to host a website on IPFS: 
      http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/QmdPtC3T7Kcu9iJg6hYzLBWR5XCDcYMY7HV685E3kH3EcS/ .  This 
      is a link to an english language version of the Wikipedia main page 
      on the IPFS: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/ .  
      I noticed, however, that this page does not have a search field 
      or any links to general topics like, art, history, and math.  So, 
      I don't know how to look up a specific topic on this IPFS-hosted 
      version of Wikipedia.  Here is a link to information about the IPFS 
      team's goals for the IPFS version of Wikipedia: https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/Qmb6SjJMzkqfKEZxXX5uET64fPkvHHoVUou84m3HAKbeZC/ .
      Regular Internet search engines can be used 
      to find other IPFS websites and music and video 
      files, including the copyrighted kind.  However, given the length 
      of time it sometimes takes data to download over the IPFS network, 
      I question whether anyone would have the patience to wait 
      around while an entire commercial movie downloads.</p>

   <p>The third method of finding content on the IPFS is with an IPFS-dedicated
      search engine called <a href="https://ipfs-search.com/">IPFS Search</a>.
      IPFS Search is a search engine on the regular Internet that gives links 
      to information on the IPFS, just like a regular search engine.  
      IPFS Search 
      also displays information about the last time a particular link was 
      successfully accessed.  When you use it, you will see that most of the 
      content that can be found through IPFS Search was last
      successfully accessed months ago and, therefore, is unlikely to be 
      accessible now.  Other than often having terse 
      titles for listed content, the most noticeable problem with
      IPFS Search is that it has no description below the link to give you a 
      better idea of what information is pointed to by the link.  This
      means it can be difficult to tell whether the link is useful or 
      not before you click on it.</p>
   <h2>Sources of Additional Information</h2>
   <p>Several good sources of information on the IPFS can be found on 
      the regular Internet.  <a href="https://achainofblocks.com/2018/10/05/ipfs-interplanetary-file-system-simply-explained/">This page</a> gives a brief
      history of the IPFS network and explains the basics of how it works.
      A 66-page, pdf manual, called <a href="https://dweb-primer.ipfs.io/decentralized-web-primer.pdf"><i>The 
      Decentralized Web Primer</i></a> is also available.  
      This manual gives more details about the installation of the command
      line version of the IPFS software. It also contains detailed 
      information about how to upload content to the IPFS. 
      You can also find more documentation on the IPFS network 
      <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/">here</a>.</p> 
   <h2>Last Words about the IPFS</h2>
   <p>From the little experience I've had using the IPFS, the speed at which 
      information can be accessed seems so inconsistent 
      that I can think of only three current uses for it: 1) creating a 
      small, …</p></div></div>

<h2>Presentations and talks</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/p-82YeUPQh0" rel="nofollow">The danger of predictive algorithms in criminal justice</a> - Dr. Hany Farid talks about how his team reverse engineered the inherent dangers and potential biases of recommendations engines built to mete out justice in today's criminal justice system.</li>

<h2>Papers and articles</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00274-3" rel="nofollow">The long road to fairer algorithms</a> - A short article on the benefits of using causal models to identify and mitigate discrimination.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06141" rel="nofollow">Gender Classification and Bias Mitigation in Facial Images</a> - A paper describing the failure of facial datasets in regards to non-binary gender and introduces a new dataset focused around the complexities of gender assignment. Uses <code>selection rate</code> as a measure of bias.</li>
<li><a href="https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/780-Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Being Bayesian, Even Just a Bit, Fixes Overconfidence in ReLU Networks</a> - The authors propose a method to model the confidence of the models with respect to the input space.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07293.pdf" rel="nofollow">Statistical Equity: A Fairness Classification Objective</a> - Proposes a new fairness definition, motivated by the principle of equity, that considers existing biases in the data and attempts to make equitable decisions that account for these previous historical biases.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06483.pdf" rel="nofollow">Face Recognition: Too Bias, or Not Too Bias?</a> - The conventional approach of learning a global threshold for all pairs
results in performance gaps between subgroups. By learning subgroup-specific thresholds, we reduce performance gaps, and also show a notable boost in overall performance.</li>
<li><a href="https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1517-Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">DeBayes: a Bayesian Method for Debiasing Network Embeddings</a> -  DeBayes: a
conceptually elegant Bayesian method that is capable of learning debiased embeddings by using a biased prior. Our experiments show that these representations can then be used to perform link prediction that is significantly more fair in terms of popular metrics such as demographic parity and equalized opportunity.</li>
<li><a href="https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/6161-Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Two Simple Ways to Learn Individual Fairness Metrics from Data</a> - Individual fairness is an intuitive definition of algorithmic fairness that addresses some of the drawbacks of group fairness. In this paper, we present two simple ways to learn fair metrics from a variety of data types. We show empirically that fair training with the learned metrics leads to improved fairness on three machine learning tasks susceptible to gender and racial biases.</li>
<li><a href="https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/2750-Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Data preprocessing to mitigate bias: A maximum entropy based approach</a> - This paper presents an algorithmic framework that can be used as a data preprocessing method towards mitigating bias. Unlike prior work, it can efficiently learn distributions over large domains, controllably adjust the representation rates of protected groups and achieve target fairness metrics such as statistical parity, yet remains close to the empirical distribution induced by the given dataset.</li>
<li><a href="https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5778-Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">Fair Generative Modeling via Weak Supervision</a> - We present a weakly supervised algorithm for overcoming dataset bias for deep generative models.</li>
<li><a href="https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1840-Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">SDE-Net: Equipping Deep Neural Networks with Uncertainty Estimates</a> - We propose a new method for quantifying uncertainties of DNNs from a dynamical system perspective. The core of our method is to view DNN transformations as state evolution of a stochastic dynamical system and introduce a Brownian motion term for capturing epistemic uncertainty.</li>
<li><a href="https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/poster_Hkekl0NFPr.html" rel="nofollow">Conditional Learning of Fair Representations</a> - We propose a novel algorithm for learning fair representations that can simultaneously mitigate two notions of disparity among different demographic subgroups in the classification setting.</li>

August 27, 2020 | https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-cultivate-shoshin-or-a-beginners-mind | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-cultivate-shoshin-or-a-beginners-mind">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>The Japanese Zen term <em>shoshin</em> translates as â€˜beginnerâ€™s mindâ€™ and refers to a paradox: the more you know about a subject, the more likely you are to close your mind to further learning. As the Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki put it in his book <em>Zen Mind, Beginnerâ€™s Mind</em> (1970): â€˜In the beginnerâ€™s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expertâ€™s there are few.â€™</p>
<p>Many historical examples demonstrate how the expert mind (or feeling like an expert) can lead to closed-mindedness and the obstruction of scientific progress. In 1912, for instance, when the German geophysicist and explorer Alfred Wegener proposed â€“ counter to the received wisdom of the day â€“ that the Earth is made up of shifting continental plates, he was ridiculed by expert geologists around the world. His German compatriots referred to his â€˜delirious ravingsâ€™ while experts in the United States accused him of peddling pseudoscience. It would take decades before the orthodoxy was overturned and the accuracy of his theory was acknowledged.</p>
<p>Similar stories abound. In my own field of neuroscience, for example, belief in the legendary Spanish neuroscientist Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajalâ€™s â€˜harsh decreeâ€™ that adult humans are unable to grow new neurons persisted for decades in the face of mounting contradictory evidence.</p>
<p>Intellectual hubris doesnâ€™t afflict only established scientific experts. Merely having a university degree in a subject can lead people to grossly overestimate their knowledge. In one pertinent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12280">study</a> in 2015, researchers at Yale University asked graduates to estimate their knowledge of various topics relevant to their degrees, and then tested their actual ability to explain those topics. The participants frequently overestimated their level of understanding, apparently mistaking the â€˜peak knowledgeâ€™ they had at the time they studied at university for their considerably more modest current knowledge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just as Suzuki wrote and as historical anecdotes demonstrate, there is research evidence that even <em>feeling</em> like an expert also breeds closed-mindedness. Another <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103115001006?via">study</a> involved giving people the impression that they were relatively expert on a topic (for example, by providing them with inflated scores on a test of political knowledge), which led them to be less willing to consider other political viewpoints â€“ a phenomenon the researchers called â€˜the earned dogmatism effectâ€™.</p>
<p>The consequences of intellectual overconfidence can be seen in the debates surrounding controversial contemporary issues. Take the matter of genetically modified (GM) foods, which are overwhelmingly considered to be safe based on current scientific knowledge. Research has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0520-3">shown</a> that people who hold the strongest anti-GM views, believing that they are harmful, are the most inclined to overestimate their relevant knowledge. Â­</p>
<p>Approaching issues with a beginnerâ€™s mind or a healthy dose of intellectual humility can help to counter the disadvantages of intellectual hubris. People who are more intellectually humble <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1579359">actually</a> know more, presumably because they are more receptive to new information. Similarly, being intellectually humble is associated with open-mindedness and a greater willingness to be receptive to other peopleâ€™s perspectives â€“ arguably just the tonic that our politically febrile world needs today.</p>
<p>Therefore, fostering your own beginnerâ€™s mind will help you to become more knowledgeable, less overconfident and more willing to engage with others â€“ traits that are also increasingly sought after by leading employers. By practising being flexible rather than dogmatic, more humble and less brazen, you will be sensitive to other peopleâ€™s perspectives and needs, making you a better sister, brother, father, mother, partner and friend. With eyes and mind wide open, itâ€™s so much easier to enjoy the wonders of the world, to grow, to learn and to listen.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>An important first step towards having a more open mind is to establish a realistic sense of your own knowledge. Countless studies have shown that most of us overestimate our understanding of various topics, everything from how a vacuum cleaner works to the detail of political policies â€“ a phenomenon <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062901/">called</a> â€˜the illusion of explanatory depthâ€™. Fortunately, there is a very simple way to address this form of intellectual overconfidence and that is to make the effort to explain a relevant issue or topic to yourself or someone else in detail, either out loud or in writing. This exercise makes the gaps in our knowledge more apparent and bursts the illusion of expertise.</p>
<p>If embarking on a full-on explanation sounds impractical or overly arduous, there is a shorthand version you can try. In 2016, psychologists at Washington and Lee University in Virginia <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0000161">showed</a> that the same beneficial effect could be achieved simply by spending a few seconds reflecting on your ability to explain a given issue to a true expert â€˜in a step-by-step, causally connected manner, with no gaps in your storyâ€™.</p>
<p>Another major hurdle to being open-minded is that we are naturally inclined to seek out information that supports our current views and beliefs â€“ a human foible known as â€˜confirmation biasâ€™. This perpetuates closed-mindedness and makes us ever surer of our own knowledge.</p>
<p>To combat confirmation bias, be aware of it. Constantly remind yourself that it exists, and take active steps to work against it by seeking out information and perspectives that contradict your current position. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-07049-001">study</a> published way back in 1980 suggested that actively challenging yourself in this way can be beneficial. Volunteers were presented with trivia questions, such as â€˜the Sabines were part of (a) ancient India or (b) ancient Romeâ€™, and then asked to rate the likelihood that their answers were correct. As expected, the volunteers tended to be overconfident in the accuracy of their answers. However, the researchers found that it was possible to reduce this overconfidence simply by asking their volunteers to list one reason why each of their chosen answers might be wrong. â€˜People who are interested in properly assessing how much they know should work harder in recruiting and weighing evidence,â€™ the researchers wrote. â€˜However, that extra effort is likely to be of little avail unless it is directed toward recruiting contradicting reasons.â€™</p>
<p>The way you think about intelligence and expertise is also relevant to being more open-minded. â€˜Growth mindset theoryâ€™ argues that if we see aptitudes as malleable rather than fixed we are able to learn better. Although the implementation of this theory in formal education has come in for some criticism lately, many continue to see value in the concept, and there is a persuasive logic to the idea that peopleâ€™s perspective on the nature of intelligence is likely to encourage their own intellectual humility.</p>
<p>A series of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2017.1361861">studies</a> published in 2018 supported this view, showing that people who were more intellectually humble also tended to have a â€˜growth mindsetâ€™ toward intelligence. This makes sense â€“ if you take the view that intelligence is something youâ€™re either blessed with or youâ€™re not, then acknowledging (or actively seeking to expose) the gaps in your own knowledge and wisdom might be threatening, serving as apparent evidence of your intellectual inferiority. Conversely, if you see intelligence as something to be developed, then finding holes in your knowledge is not so threatening: instead, it opens up exciting new opportunities for learning.</p>
<p>Promisingly, that same 2018 paper showed that it might be possible to foster intellectual humility by encouraging a growth mindset. Asking volunteers to read a scientific article about the malleability of intelligence led them to score higher on a measure of intellectual humility and to be more open to other perspectives, as compared with a control group. â€˜This study suggests that intellectual humility can be at least temporarily enhanced, and points to a growth mindset as a set of beliefs that seems capable of doing so,â€™ the researchers said.</p>
<p>A final, more pleasurable step you can take to increase your intellectual humility comes in the form of deliberately invoking in oneself the emotion of awe. Several studies have shown that awe quietens the ego and prompts epistemological openness â€“ that is, a greater willingness to look at things differently and to recognise the gaps in oneâ€™s knowledge. The emotion also seems to reduce peopleâ€™s need to be satisfied by definite, closed arguments.</p>
<p>Consider a series of <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-46364-001.html">studies</a> published in 2019 that involved volunteers watching awe-inspiring videos of nature or of the night skies â€“ doing so led them to hold beliefs about capital punishment with less conviction; to see political debates as less polarised; and to be more willing to engage with others holding opposing views on immigration. Another <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2019.1585331">paper</a> published the same year, and that used nature videos and a virtual-reality experience of the aurora borealis to induce awe, found that the emotion led volunteers to be more aware of the gaps in their knowledge, and to take a keener interest in science. Paraphrasing Albert Einstein, the researchers wrote that â€˜one who never experiences awe ceases to discoverâ€™. The message is simple: to increase your open-mindedness, try taking the time to gaze in wonder at the stars.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="3"><span>Key points</span></h2><div><ul>
<li> <strong>Explain a theory or idea to yourself or someone else.</strong> Overconfidence in your own knowledge and expertise fuels closed-mindedness. By attempting to explain an idea or argument to someone else, you will get a more realistic sense of what you do and donâ€™t know.</li>
<li> <strong>Argue with yourself.</strong> Itâ€™s an essential part of human psychology that we are inclined to seek out knowledge and information that is consistent with our current views and beliefs.

<p>
The field of graph representation learning has grown at an incredible (and sometimes unwieldy) pace over the past seven years, transforming from a small subset of researchers working on a relatively niche topic to one of the fastest growing sub-areas of deep learning.
</p>
<p>
This book is my attempt to provide a brief but comprehensive introduction to graph representation learning, including methods for embedding graph data, graph neural networks, and deep generative models of graphs.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3389">

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of its mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

			<p><em>Edit from 2015/12/17: Memory model described in this article is deprecated starting Apache Spark 1.6+, the new memory model is based on UnifiedMemoryManager&nbsp;and described in <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-memory-management/" target="_blank">this article</a></em></p>
<p>Over the recent time I’ve answered a series of questions related to ApacheSpark architecture on StackOverflow. All of them seem to be caused by the absence of a good general description of the Spark architecture in the internet. Even official guide does not have that many details and of cause it lacks good diagrams. Same for the “Learning Spark” book and the materials of official workshops.</p>
<p>In this article I would try to fix this and provide a single-stop shop guide for Spark architecture in general and some most popular questions on its concepts. This article is not for complete beginners – it will not provide you an insight on the Spark main programming abstractions (RDD and DAG), but requires their knowledge as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>This is the first&nbsp;article in a series. The second one regarding shuffle <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-architecture-shuffle/" target="_blank">is available here</a>. The third one about new memory management model <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-memory-management/" target="_blank">is available here</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the official picture available on the <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.0/cluster-overview.html">http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.0/cluster-overview.html</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official-300x140.png?resize=300%2C140" alt="Spark Architecture Official" width="300" height="140" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png?resize=300%2C140&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png?w=607&amp;ssl=1 607w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>As you might see, it has many terms introduced at the same time – “executor”, “task”, “cache”, “Worker Node” and so on. When I started to learn the Spark concepts some time ago, it was almost the only picture about Spark architecture available over the internet and now the things didn’t change much. I personally don’t really like this because it does not show some important concepts or shows them not in the best way.</p>
<p>Let’s start from the beginning. Any, any Spark process that would ever work on your cluster or local machine is a JVM process. As for any JVM process, you can configure its heap size with <em>-Xmx</em> and <em>-Xms</em> flags of the JVM. How does this process use its heap memory and why does it need it at all? Here’s the diagram of Spark memory allocation inside of the JVM heap:</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Heap-Usage.png?resize=475%2C631" alt="Spark Heap Usage" width="475" height="631" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Heap-Usage.png?w=475&amp;ssl=1 475w, https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Heap-Usage.png?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>By default, Spark starts with 512MB JVM heap. To be on a safe side and avoid OOM error Spark allows to utilize only 90% of the heap, which is controlled by the <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction</em> parameter of Spark. Ok, as you might have heard of Spark as an in-memory tool, Spark allows you to store some data in memory. If you have read my article here <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-misconceptions/">https://0x0fff.com/spark-misconceptions/</a>, you should understand that Spark is not really in-memory tool, it just utilizes the memory for its LRU cache (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms</a>). So some amount of memory is reserved for the caching of the data you are processing, and this part is usually 60% of the safe heap, which is controlled by the <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction</em> parameter. So if you want to know how much data you can cache in Spark, you should take the sum of all the heap sizes for all the executors, multiply it by <em>safetyFraction</em> and by <em>storage.memoryFraction</em>, and by default it is 0.9 * 0.6 = 0.54 or 54% of the total heap size you allow Spark to use.</p>
<p>Now a bit more about the shuffle memory. It is calculated as “Heap Size” * <em>spark.shuffle.safetyFraction</em> * <em>spark.shuffle.memoryFraction</em>. Default value for <em>spark.shuffle.safetyFraction</em> is 0.8 or 80%, default value for <em>spark.shuffle.memoryFraction</em> is 0.2 or 20%. So finally you can use up to 0.8*0.2 = 0.16 or 16% of the JVM heap for the shuffle. But how does Spark uses this memory? You can get more details on this here (<a href="https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/shuffle/ShuffleMemoryManager.scala">https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/shuffle/ShuffleMemoryManager.scala</a>), but in general Spark uses this memory for the exact task it is called after – for Shuffle. When the shuffle is performed, sometimes you as well need to sort the data. When you sort the data, you usually need a buffer to store the sorted data (remember, you cannot modify the data in the LRU cache in place as it is there to be reused later). So it needs some amount of RAM to store the sorted chunks of data. What happens if you don’t have enough memory to sort the data? There is a wide range of algorithms usually referenced as “external sorting” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting</a>) that allows you to sort the data chunk-by-chunk and then merge the final result together.</p>
<p>The last part of RAM I haven’t yet cover is “unroll” memory. The amount of RAM that is allowed to be utilized by unroll process is <em>spark.storage.unrollFraction</em> * <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction</em> * <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction</em>, which with the default values equal to 0.2 * 0.6 * 0.9 = 0.108 or 10.8% of the heap. This is the memory that can be used when you are unrolling the block of data into the memory. Why do you need to unroll it after all? Spark allows you to store the data both in serialized and deserialized form. The data in serialized form cannot be used directly, so you have to unroll it before using, so this is the RAM that is used for unrolling. It is shared with the storage RAM, which means that if you need some memory to unroll the data, this might cause dropping some of the partitions stored in the Spark LRU cache.</p>
<p>This is great, because at the moment you know what exactly Spark process is and how it utilizes the memory of its JVM processes. Now let’s switch to the cluster mode – when you start a Spark cluster, how does it really look like? I like YARN so I would cover how it works in YARN, but in general it is the same for any cluster manager you use:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN-1024x826.png?resize=625%2C504" alt="Spark Architecture On YARN" width="625" height="504" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=1024%2C826&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=624%2C503&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?w=1816&amp;ssl=1 1816w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?w=1250&amp;ssl=1 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>When you have a YARN cluster, it has a YARN Resource Manager daemon that controls the cluster resources (practically memory) and a series of YARN Node Managers running on the cluster nodes and controlling node resource utilization. From the YARN standpoint, each node represents a pool of RAM that you have a control over. When you request some resources from YARN Resource Manager, it gives you information of which Node Managers you can contact to bring up the execution containers for you. Each execution container is a JVM with requested heap size. JVM locations are chosen by the YARN Resource Manager and you have no control over it – if the node has 64GB of RAM controlled by YARN (<em>yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb</em> setting in yarn-site.xml) and you request 10 executors with 4GB each, all of them can be easily started on a single YARN node even if you have a big cluster.</p>
<p>When you start Spark cluster on top of YARN, you specify the amount of executors you need (<em>–num-executors</em> flag or <em>spark.executor.instances</em> parameter), amount of memory to be used for each of the executors (<em>–executor-memory</em> flag or <em>spark.executor.memory </em>&nbsp;parameter), amount of cores allowed to use for each executors (<em>–executor-cores</em> flag of <em>spark.executor.cores</em> parameter), and amount of cores dedicated for each task’s execution (<em>spark.task.cpus</em> parameter). Also you specify the amount of memory to be used by the driver application (<em>–driver-memory</em> flag or <em>spark.driver.memory</em> parameter).</p>
<p>When you execute something on a cluster, the processing of your job is split up into stages, and each stage is split into tasks. Each task is scheduled separately. You can consider each of the JVMs working as executors as a pool of task execution slots, each executor would give you <em>spark.executor.cores</em> / <em>spark.task.cpus</em> execution slots for your tasks, with a total of <em>spark.executor.instances</em> executors. Here’s&nbsp;an example. The cluster with 12 nodes running YARN Node Managers, 64GB of RAM each and 32 CPU cores each (16 physical cores with hyper threading). This way on each node you can start 2 executors with 26GB of RAM each (leave some RAM for system processes, YARN NM and DataNode), each executor with 12 cores to be utilized for tasks (leave some cores for system processes, YARN NM and DataNode). So In total your cluster would handle 12 machines * 2 executors per machine * 12 cores per executor / 1 core for each task = 288 task slots. This means that your Spark cluster would be able to run up to 288 tasks in parallel thus utilizing almost all the resources you have on this cluster. The amount of RAM you can use for caching your data on this cluster is 0.9 <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction&nbsp;</em>* 0.6 <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction&nbsp;</em>* 12 machines * 2 executors per machine * 26 GB per executor = 336.96 GB. Not that much, but in most cases it is enough.</p>
<p>So far so good, now you know how the Spark uses its JVM’s memory and what are the execution slots you have on your cluster. As you might already noticed, I didn’t stop in details on what the “task” really is. This would be a subject of the next article, but basically it is a single unit of work performed by Spark, and is executed as a <strong><em>thread</em></strong> in the executor JVM. This is the secret under the Spark low job startup time – forking additional thread inside of the JVM is much faster that bringing up the whole JVM, which is performed when you start a MapReduce job in Hadoop.</p>
<p>Now let’s focus on another Spark abstraction called “<em><strong>partition</strong></em>”. All the data you work with in Spark is split into partitions. What a single partition is and how is it determined? Partition size completely depends on the data source you use. For most of the methods to read the data in Spark you can specify the amount of partitions you want to have in your RDD. When you read a file from HDFS, you use Hadoop’s InputFormat to make it. By default each input split returned by InputFormat is mapped to a single partition in RDD. For most of the files on HDFS single input split is generated for a single block of data stored on HDFS, which equals to approximately 64MB of 128MB of data. Approximately, because the data in HDFS is split on exact block boundaries in bytes, but when it is processed it is split on the record splits. For text file the splitting character is the newline char, for sequence file it is the block end and so on. The only exception of this rule is compressed files – if you have the whole text file compressed, then it cannot be split into records and the whole file would become a single input split and thus a single partition in …</p></div></div>

                    <p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, COVID-19 is the first pandemic that spreads worldwide and affects major world's population. Thanks to technology and AI-powered projects that use machine learning to target a broad range of fields for outbreak assessment. The growing trend in COVID-19 cases is due to the sudden reopening of cities after a complete lockdown. It forced the Governors to pause the reopening or implement smart lockdown in hotspots for COVID-19. </p><h2 id="identification-of-covid-19-hotspots-empowered-by-technology">Identification of COVID-19 hotspots empowered by technology </h2><p>Technology helps to resist the spreading of the outbreak in the big cities for a potential attack of coronavirus. Pakistan’s Planning Minister Asad Umar referred the use of technology for tracking and identifying pinpoint areas to impose smart lockdown there. </p><p>The Federal Government of Pakistan asked Dr. Umar Saif, CEO of <a href="https://surveyauto.com/">SurveyAuto</a>, to practice his technological expertise. He created a web portal that simplifies COVID-19 control by implementing smart lockdown after identifying hotspots. It provides real-time information that’s easy to consolidate in one place.</p><p>Interestingly, one cannot calculate the actual number of rising patients via a single metric. For instance, the results may differ due to the three factors:</p><ol><li>The number of tests increased at a particular time.</li><li>Transmission rate increased.</li><li>Both factors together can also result in rising COVID-19 patients. </li></ol><h2 id="ncoc-strategy-to-identify-covid-19-hotspots">NCOC strategy to identify COVID-19 hotspots</h2><p>The National Command and Operations Centre (NCOC) detected 20 big cities at high risk of COVID-19. The pandemic already affected more than one million people countrywide. It identifies by using the strategy of <strong>testing, tracing, and quarantining (TTQ). </strong>The TTQ technique quickly checks for active coronavirus patients and efficiently quarantine that specific area. NCOC talked about the operationalization of oxygenated beds and further ventilators to support patients. Moreover, it asked the <a href="http://www.ndma.gov.pk/">National Disaster Management Authority</a>(NDMA) to provide on-time critical healthcare instruments.</p><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/08/UmarSaif_Twitter.jpg"><figcaption>Dr. Umar Saif via Twitter</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.who.int/">World Health Organization</a> adjured Pakistan to apply lockdown in the country as the number of affected patients increased at a high rate. That results due to the leniency in the countrywide lockdown strategy during the last months. The twenty hotspots areas:</p><p>Karachi, Quetta, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Lahore, Peshawar, Swat, Sukkur, Larkana, Gujrat, Sialkot, Ghotki, Hyderabad, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Mardan, Khairpur, and Malakand.</p><p>Hence, it forced the government to impose smart lockdown across vulnerable areas as the majority of people became infected with it. </p><h2 id="surveyauto-technology">SurveyAuto technology </h2><p>It is a technological organization that deals with the computer sciences domain. It offers unique systems to collect high-quality and reliable information from the field. SurveyAuto comes up with a strategy that only highlights the hotspots of the coronavirus disease. It pinpoints the areas with a high number of COVID-19 infected patients. Thus, it helps to permit locomotion around the country by sealing only concerned areas. It also offers a positive influence on economic dealings that will otherwise be affected severely. The working technology behind SurveyAuto is as simple as one can say. It will take <strong>a seventy-five-billion-dollar</strong> research industry by using <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>. Let's discuss this.</p><h2 id="how-surveyauto-collects-data-in-real-time">How SurveyAuto collects data in real-time?</h2><p>It works on advanced technology that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Machine Learning (ML) as a national contribution to fight coronavirus. The users can easily install this application in their smartphones. Moreover, it favors them to know are they healthy or infected in real-time without going to any hospital for testing. It exceptionally marks, tracks, and screen survey areas using <strong>Machine Learning</strong> on S<strong>atellite Imagery &amp; Hyperspectral Imagery</strong>. It provides high-quality information about collected data by analyzing voice and images automatically. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="how-surveyauto-efficiently-detect-hotspots-of-the-covid-19">How SurveyAuto efficiently detect hotspots of the COVID-19?</h2><p>It collects data from water bodies, farms and fields, industrial buildings, and houses to check their vulnerability for coronavirus activity. It provides information about <strong>exact survey targets</strong>by combining the available and collected data. Besides, it diminishes the need for any pre-survey and avoids human errors to support a clear and compelling AI-based analysis.</p><p>It gathers information from all well established and poverty areas by using satellite imagery strategy. Furthermore, it also analyzes Call Data History to get information about people with coughing. Its system is efficient enough to visualize farm areas and any natural catastrophe at day and night to save the community. SurveyAuto delivers the tracked and monitored information in no-time to access the changes and take action accordingly. </p><h2 id="how-the-final-results-of-surveryauto-helps-government">How the final results of SurveryAuto helps government?</h2><p>In simple words, people who are working in the government's fields having smartphones install the SurveyAuto App. Consequently, it produces an easy to get epidemiological and mathematical graphic analysis. The system sends the collected information to the government to take quick action about the outbreak. It uses a machine-learning strategy coupled with satellite imagery to detect COVID-19 occupied space. The system uses the SEIR COVID-19 prediction model to count houses, produce population maps, and outbreak spread rate graphs.</p><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/08/SmartLockdown_Main-1.jpg"><figcaption>Source: Reuters</figcaption></figure><h2 id="faisal-sultan-statement-about-surveryauto-technology">Faisal Sultan statement about SurveryAuto technology</h2><p>After all, prediction models use the obtained analysis to share on-time updates about the hotspots of COVID-19. &nbsp;It ultimately helps to lockdown only those specific areas. SurveyAuto strategy inspired Doctor Faisal Sultan, the PM’s focal person for the outbreak; he shared a statement:</p><p>‘’Grateful to <a href="https://pitb.gov.pk/umarsaif">Umar Saif</a>and his startup SurveyAuto for providing the platform for hotspot-based selective lockdown in Pakistan. It is based on sophisticated mathematical and epidemiological models to highlight hotspots and enables the govt to monitor compliance.’’ </p><p>Dr. Umar Saif, the Chief Digital Officer of Jang/Geo Media Groups, didn’t take even a single penny. He said in a conversation that nothing is more valuable than the safety of Pakistan and its residents. In one of his tweets, he added that SurveyAuto is a joint AI and Big Data technology to conveniently apply S<strong>mart Lockdown</strong>.</p><h2 id="advantages-of-using-ai-based-surveyauto-technology">Advantages of using AI-based SurveyAuto technology </h2><p>The technology under discussion also involves the prediction of expected patients in every affected region. Moreover, it provides a comparison report of expected patients and hospital capacity to acquire them. SurveryAuto, while collecting field workers' data, shares real-time instructions related to standard operating procedures (SOPs). It also reduces time consumption and errors due to human inefficiency or inexperienced staff members. Dr. Umar Saif added more:</p><blockquote>‘’SurveyAuto uses a crowdsourcing model and relies on machine learning to decide who reports data, where it's collected, and when and how often it is reported. It reduces cost and lessens human errors’’.</blockquote><p>However, the clock tower market of Faisalabad is one of the busiest markets in the city. SurveyAuto app recorded a significant drop in the identification of COVID-19 patients. </p><p>Bill Gates opened doors to support this innovative technology and invested in the firm. SurveyAuto Technology is in use explicitly for several other departments including:</p><ul><li>Innovation in Poverty Action (IPA)</li><li>World Bank</li><li>ITA</li><li>UNESCO</li></ul><h2 id="how-ai-helps-to-monitor-area-after-lockdown">How AI helps to monitor area after lockdown?</h2><p><strong> </strong>AI technologies, also famous as <strong>Futuristic, </strong>help humans in business as well as control pandemic spread. It's an efficient tool to fight outbreaks by focusing on healthcare and providing public healthcare services. It provides pharmacology, medical, and hospital care services to overcome the disasters of coronavirus. Moreover, it monitors crowded areas and alerts the concerned department in real-time to take the right action. Data obtained from AI technologies help to proceed with the process towards conclusions.</p><h2 id="ai-based-chest-x-ray-technique">AI-based chest X-Ray technique</h2><p>Recently, the research institutes started developing artificial intelligence-based algorithms to support the next generation. It prevents them from acquiring any disease as the AI machine learning system detects and stops the spread of the outbreak in a given time. <strong>Medical Image Screening Platforms </strong>developed by AI Laboratories detect coronavirus activity by a chest X-ray of a patient. If the X-ray shows the symptoms of pneumonia or SARS-CoV-2, the software reads information and alerts the doctor about the disease. AI reduces the time of testing that, on average, takes two weeks to minutes. So, the developed prediction models help to lower infection spread rates to a great extent.</p><h2 id="hospitals-public-healthcare-centers">Hospitals &amp; public healthcare centers</h2><p>AI and healthcare services helped the human community by taking their burden to identify either person is wearing a face mask or not. An intelligent-edge device is placed on the hospital’s entry point. It comes with an <strong>Infrared Sensor </strong>that detects any change in optimum body temperature and alert doctors about any alarming situation. While the AI portion detects face-mask-wearing people; so, it permits to enter only those with average temperature and face mask. The science behind this technology is <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ai/"><strong>Azure Bot</strong></a><strong> </strong>informing responsible staff at hospitals or healthcare centers in real-time about any abnormality. </p><p>The healthcare workers also utilize a wireless, easily portable, and versatile device to monitor the patient's information. It favors the front-line workers to share incoming patient's details in no time with the doctors.</p><h2 id="public-place-strategies">Public place strategies</h2><p>Different organizations are working to provide <strong>new norms </strong>to develop innovative solutions for public and crowded places.

<p>The amount of folks who are up in arms about <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/25/linux_kernel_email/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sarah Novotny's views on email based workflows in Linux</a> put a smirk on my face today, but I figured I would post my own opinions, having both spent way too many hours with mutt, offlineimap, postfix, and so on. I even wrote an entire article series on this for Ars Technica that is so old I can't even find it on the web any more. And Lee Hutchinson's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/how-to-run-your-own-e-mail-server-with-your-own-domain-part-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version is from 2014</a>! </p>

<p>How can someone who is wanting to contribute to the kernel possibly not know how to send a plain text email? If you can't do that then you have no business in the kernel right?</p>

<p>It's not a matter of can't, it's a matter of won't. There's a reason no one writes their resumes in LaTeX either.  Sure, I can do it. I figured it out, achievement unlocked. </p>

<p>You would be shocked at the amount of <em>core contributors to Kubernetes</em> that we routinely find aren't subscribed to the main mailing list. Sending git formatted patches over email, are you kidding? Most of my open source collaborators aren't even  <em>reading</em> their emails lol. </p>

<p>You don't send a mail to the list to propose something, you <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps" rel="noopener" target="_blank">write an enhancement proposal</a> and if you're nice, you might mention it on a list, but all that activity happens in GitHub. And if you want a meaty discussion you hop onto Zoom and discuss it high bandwidth style with your SIG before moving on. You're not going to find lengthy discussions about technical features on many of our mailing lists, you'll find them in the GitHub issues, PR comments, and meeting transcripts. </p>

<ul>
<li>VMware (my employer) has incredible Kubernetes and cloud native content: <a href="https://tgik.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TGIK</a>  is all on YouTube. </li>
<li>It's not a coincidence that <a href="https://www.openshift.com/streaming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenShift streams on twitch</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>No fair you say! There's a difference between using/consuming technical content and coordinating/running an entire project. That's the point, not any more! </p>

<p>Watch how Martin Wimpress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ICRjjjMbEE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">does a live package update in Ubuntu MATE</a>. That level of interaction with the audience isn't just the future of OSS development, it's the present. Our next kernel people, Debian maintainers, library maintainers, and everything inbetween are sitting in places like this and this is how they interact with themselves and their communities. There's just too much awesome shit in the world for people to slow down to figure out emails and mailman. And if you think this is just about email, wait until you see how much coordination and awesome stuff is happening in Discord. Yep, this is about IRC too, all of it. </p>

<p>I hear ya, I wish plaintext wasn't on the way out as a workflow, but at the end of the day, most projects aren't Linux. You can't afford an email mailing list workflow, you need to be where the developers are. New developers coming into the field are as likely to be on AOL than setting up mutt, that's just how it ended up. The distribution developers know how to do this, it's part of their job, but let's not kid ourselves,  the eyeballs are not on mailing lists.</p>

<p>Linux is missing an entire generation of new talent due to this. I don't sweat it, Linux is fundamental technology, it'll survive just fine, but it'll continue to be a workflow that won't jive with a number of people coming into the field. </p>

<p>Also it's pretty evident from most Microsoft conspiracy comments that no one bothered to look up Sarah's OSS credentials, but of course, that didn't surprise you either. Her points still stand if you replace GitHub with GitLab, or whatever tool you prefer. </p>
